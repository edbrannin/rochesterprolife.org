"From medical textbooks and pharmacy references, to statements from the Pill-manufacturers themselves, this book proves, beyond any doubt, the abortion-causing action of birth control pills. This book should be read by everyone interested in knowing the truth."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Paul L. Hayes, M.D., Board Certified Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians/Gynecologists</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">2. "Does the birth control pill cause abortions? Using research results from medical literature, Randy Alcorn has convincingly shown that the answer is `yes.' He has, with care and compassion, given us the truth. The question for us as Christians is how we will respond now that we know."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Linda Martin, M.D., Pediatrician</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">3. "By carefully detailing the available medical information concerning the abortifacient effects of oral contraceptives, Randy Alcorn has developed a logical and thoughtful challenge to every prolife person. The conclusions of this study are scientifically accurate. Birth control pills usually prevent pregnancy, but sometimes they cause an abortion. Questions? Objections? Randy has addressed them in a gentle but firm way. This is the manner in which the often fiery debate over prolife subjects should be carried out- unemotionally, intelligently and quietly. The evidence is before us . . . `How should we then live?'"</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Patrick D. Walker, M.D., Professor of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">4. "In this challenging book Randy Alcorn has the honesty to face a tough and uncomfortable question. This compelling evidence will make you rethink the question of birth control pills."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ John Brose, M.D., Surgeon</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">5. "In this impeccably researched book, Randy Alcorn takes an unblinking look at what medical experts know about how birth control pills work. I painfully agree that birth control pills do in fact cause abortions. Our individual and collective Christian response to this heretofore varnished-over information will have profound consequences for time and eternity. This is a disturbing must-read for all who profess to be prolife."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Beverly A. McMillan, M.D., Ob/Gyn</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">6. "Randy Alcorn has done exceptional work. The facts in this book parallel much of my own research.

Most Americans are not aware that the Pill and other chemical "contraceptives" cause millions of "non-surgical" abortions each year in the early weeks of pregnancy. If you are using the Pill, Depo-Provera or Norplant, you need to know the truth about how these products work.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Most women take these "contraceptives" because they don't want to have a baby. But how many women know they can have BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS and become pregnant while using these "contraceptives?" Very few! And how many of these women know that if they become pregnant after a BREAKTHROUGH OVULATION, these "contraceptives" will almost always kill any son or daughter they've conceived?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Most people don't know the real facts about how "contraceptives" work. And because of this lack of knowledge, most women are not aware that they may be having BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS, and conceiving children that are killed very early in the pregnancy. Women using these "contraceptives" almost never perceive that they have become pregnant, or that chemicals have killed their tiny baby.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">What is Breakthrough Ovulation?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">While using the Pill and other chemical "birth control" products, many women's ovaries continue to release eggs. This is called "Breakthrough Ovulation" and it occurs in millions of women each year. Once an egg has been released via ovulation, a woman can become pregnant.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">You can still conceive a child . . .</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">If you're using "birth control" products and you have a breakthrough ovulation that releases an egg, sperm can then reach and fertilize your egg. At that moment -- you would be pregnant! Fertilization means conception has taken place and you now have a brand new son or daughter who is as complete genetically as he or she will ever be throughout life.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">When Does Human Life Begin?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Internationally-known geneticists and biologists have testified that human life begins at conception. In 1981 (April 23-24) a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings on the question: When does human life begin? The following doctors testified:</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Dr. Hymie Gordon, Chairman of the Department of Genetics at the Mayo Clinic, said: "By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Dr. McCarthy de Mere, a medical doctor and law professor at the University of Tennessee, testified: "The exact moment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Dr. Jerome Lejeune, The Father of Modern Genetics, testified that, "Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon we call the DNA."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">The late Dr. Lejeune of Paris, France, discovered the genetic cause of Down Syndrome. He received the Kennedy Prize for this discovery, as well as the Memorial Allen Award Medal, the world's highest award for work in the field of Genetics.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">How does the Pill work?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">The Pill has three mechanisms of action which can easily be looked up in the Physician's Desk Reference.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">1) Sometimes, the Pill suppresses ovulation. When this happens, an egg is not released and conception cannot occur. (It's important to read on and find out about the high rates of breakthrough ovulation. When ovulation is not suppressed, pregnancy can occur.)</font></strong></p><p align="center"><br /><strong><font size="3">2) The Pill also works to thicken the woman's cervical mucus which can "restrict" sperm from moving up the reproductive tract toward the egg.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><br /><strong><font size="3">3) One way the Pill causes early abortions is that it interfers with the flexing motions and the cilia movement of the fallopian tubes. These changes slow the transportation of newly conceived child from the fallopian tubes to the womb. Unfortunately, many small babies starve to death in the fallopian tubes because chemicals caused changes that prevented them from reaching the womb in time to be nourished.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">4) Another way the Pill causes early abortions: If your tiny baby survives the ride down the fallopian tube to your womb, the Pill will almost always cause the endometrium (the lining of your uterus) to reject your child. Chemical reactions often cause the lining of your womb to become thin, shriveled and unable to support implantation of your newly conceived child.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">This means that in almost every case, your new child will not be able to attach to the wall of your womb where he or she would normally live, grow and receive nourishment for 9 months. This means your tiny baby will starve to death and his or her remains will be passed along in your next bleeding cycle. (The "Study of Abortion Deaths Commission" estimates that this happens in women in America who use the Pill approximately 1 to 4 million times each year.)</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">The chemicals that cause these early abortions are called abortifacients which is the medical term for any chemical agent that causes an abortion.</font></strong></p><p align="center">&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><ul><li><div align="center"><strong><font color="#993300" size="4">For a comprehensive list of resources on the abortifacient effect of birth control</font></strong></div></li></ul><p align="center"><a class="external free" title="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html"><font color="#2861b5" size="2"><strong>http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html</strong></font></a></p><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p align="center"><img height="103" alt="" width="137" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/Depo-provera.jpg" /></p><p align="center"><img height="78" alt="" width="140" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/3795483148.jpg" /></p><p align="center"><br /><strong><font size="3">Depo-Provera, Norplant and IUDs</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Depo-Provera and Norplant both use chemicals that work in very simlar ways on a woman's body and womb. Depo-Provera and Norplant are also considered chemical abortifacients.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">IUDs or Intra-Uterine Devices, are small plastic devices that are inserted into the womb. Some IUDs contain copper or a time released hormone. It is believed that the IUD causes a low grade inflammation in the lining of the womb. As a result, the lining of the womb is imperfect and the fertilized egg will not implant. (Source: This paragraph on IUDs is quoted directly from the Calgary Regional Health Authority's web site.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Because of the chemical effect an IUD has on a woman's womb, tiny babies are aborted. Therefore, IUDs are also considered abortifacients.</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">Breakthrough ovulation proved long ago . . .</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Birth control advocates and manufacturers of the Pill have known these facts for years. Have they done a very good job of informing women about how the Pill really works? (Please email us and let us know if you were aware of how the Pill worked before you read this.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">When chemists devised the Pill that debuted in 1960, they gave it a huge dose of a chemical that caused most women's ovaries to stop secreting eggs (i.e., to stop ovulation). The theory was "no egg, no pregnancy."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">However, some women continued to release eggs and get pregnant while on the original Pill. (Studies have shown that an even higher percentage of women release eggs while using today's newer, re-formulated Pills. More about today's Pills in a moment.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In her award winning study of women taking the earlier high dose Pills, Dutch gynecologist Dr. Nine Van der Vange showed "proof of ovulation based on ultrasound exams and hormonal indicators occurred in about 4.7% of the cycles studied." (Source: Sterns, Dr. David, "How the Pill and the IUD Work: Gambling with Life," American Life League, PO Box 1350, Stafford, VA 22555)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">And the "Textbook of Contraceptive Practice" states that, "Among women who have been followed over a considerable number of cycles, breakthrough ovulations occur in 2 to 10 percent of cycles."

Peel &amp; Dr. Malcolm Potts, Textbook of Contraceptive Practice, 1969, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Please note that these references are to the lower breakthrough ovulation rates of the Pills of the 1960's.

Let's look at the large pharmaceutical companies who advertise, market and sell the Pill. They make huge profits from the Pill -- and they'll continue to make mega-profits -- if women are convinced they're not getting pregnant and they keep buying and taking the Pill everyday. But are they being honest with you? Have they clearly explained that their products cause millions of early chemical abortions each year?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The New Pills: Much Higher Rates of Breakthrough Ovulation . . .</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The original Pill of the 1960's had to be modified due to harmful side effects that women were experiencing because of the powerful chemicals. All versions of today's "Combination Pill" have a reduced hormonal content. When compared to the Pills of the 1960's and 1970's, this reduces the chance of harmful side effects for women, but it also increases their chances of ovulating and conceiving a son or daughter.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Dr. Ronald Chez, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), publicly stated that the new Pills of today, with their lower estrogen dose, allow ovulation up to 50% of the time! (Source: Sterns, David, M.D., Sterns, Gina, R.N., B.S.N., Yaksich, Pamela, "Gambling with Life, How the I.U.D. and 'The Pill' Work" (www.top.net/vitalsigns).</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">With these newer Pills, simply missing one tablet, or failing to take the Pill at the same time each day increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation. Reactions with other drugs increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation, especially with caffeine and nicotine, or some prescription medicine (Source: "Abortifacient Contraception: The Pharmaceutical Holocaust" by Dr. Rudolf Ehmann, Human Life Intl., 1993, p.15).</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Makers of the new "mini-pill" claim it does not have the side effects of the combination pill. However, they don't tell you that scientific research shows the mini-pill does not stop ovulation at all in 67-81% of the women who use it, so the probability of conception is much higher.

A Tulane Law School Professor wrote:</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">...nearly all birth control devices, except the diaphragm and the condom, operate between the time of conception and implantation... (Emphasis added)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Attorney Frank Sussman argued in the U.S. Supreme Court: ...IUDs [and] low dose birth control pills...act as abortifacients.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Big Lie</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Propoganda from many pharmaceutical companies promotes a new definition of CONCEPTION. Their new definition is absolutely untruthful and totally unscientific. They created this new definition of when a child is conceived to help them sell their products with the label "contraceptives." Their new definition says that conception occurs only when your baby successfully attaches to the lining of your uterus. THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The real medical truth.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">It's very important to understand that when a sperm penetrates one of your eggs, you have conceived a child. Again, this is called fertilization or conception and from that point on, you have a brand new, genetically complete son or daughter.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Every conception is a very unique moment. For example, at your own conception, 46 chromosomes with 30,000 genes combined to determine all your physical characteristics; sex, facial features, body type, color of hair, eyes and skin. Even more amazing, intelligence and personality -- the way you think and feel -- were already in place within your genetic code. At the moment of conception, you were essentially and uniquely "you." This is the same for every human being at the moment of conception.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Remember, the pharmaceutical industry has a multi-billion dollar business selling these abortifacients. Unfortunately, many of the people who prescribe these products are not aware of their homicidal properties. They may have a sincere desire to help women, but their lack of knowledge makes them uninformed accomplices to these early abortions.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">As recent as 25 years ago, most doctors took the Hippocratic Oath. They pledged never to perform an abortion. Tragically, many working in the medical profession today betray your trust by renouncing this ethic. Many know the truth but do not inform you that "birth control" devices are abortifacients which cause abortions.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Did you know abortion was defined in a Public Health Service document published by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare as follows:</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"All the measures which impair the viability of the zygote anytime between the instant of fertilization and the completion of labor constitute, in the strict sense, procedures for inducing abortion" (source: Public Health Service Leaflet no. 1066, US Dept of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1963, 27). This includes chemical abortions like those caused by the Pill, Depo-Provera and Norplant.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Now That You Know The Truth . . .</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">If you have used these products, this is very sobering news. Pharmaceutical companies and medical providers have made many parents unwitting accomplices to their own children's death by birth control abortion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Pill and its "cousins" kill children earlier in their life than surgical abortion. In America, chemical abortions are estimated to kill more than 7 million babies each year -- while surgical abortions kill about 1.5 million babies each year.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">What will you do?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Scientists agree that a new human life begins at the moment of conception. If you believe this, then you know that abortion is wrong no matter how early in the pregnancy.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Now that you know the facts, statistics show that if you continue using abortifacient products, you will be aborting (killing) your own children each year. Do more research if you need to, but please stop using abortifacient chemicals immediately. (If you want to investigate further, another web site that contains more research and much greater detail is listed at the end of this article. It is highly recommended that you go to that web site today or sometime soon.)</font></strong></p><p><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><p><font size="3"><img height="150" alt="" width="104" src="/Portals/0/religious_pics/Images0236.jpg" /></font></p><p><br /><strong><font color="#993300" size="3">Healing &amp; Forgiveness!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">If you have used these products -- there is a very real possibility that you unknowingly aborted one or more of your tiny sons or daughters. Please do not despair! Know that you may receive comfort in your sorrow. If you did not know these "birth control" products cause early abortions, then you are not "culpable." This means you're not morally responsible in God's eyes. And because you did not know the true consequences of chemical "birth control" products, you will not be held morally responsible for any harm they may have caused.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Remember, for anyone to commit a sinful act, all three of the following circumstances must be present:</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">1) The act must break one of God's Laws,</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">2) The person must know they are breaking God's Law, and</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">3) The person must freely choose to break God's Law with their own</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">free will.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Again, if you've used "birth control" pills and you were unaware of the consequences, God will not hold you morally accountable. Our God is a merciful, loving Father. He will only judge us based on our knowledge of right and wrong. And when we do wrong, He's always ready to forgive us -- no matter how serious the sin.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">At the same time, He has given us guidelines to protect us and to help us be happy. And now that you know the truth about "birth control" pills -- if you're using them -- isn't it time to stop?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">God calls on each of us to avoid and eliminate all sin from our lives. Please think about the day in the future when you will meet your Maker face to face. On that day, if you continue using chemical abortifacients after you read this information, He will ask you, "Why?"</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Why not stop today? Why not purify your soul by receiving God's healing Grace? God will forgive us for our past sins, no matter how serious they are, but only if we sincerely ask for His forgiveness with a humble, repentant heart, while also being firmly resolved not to commit the sin again.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Our God is merciful, forgiving and gracious to all who repent. No problem is so great that the God who created us cannot solve it.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Saint Paul wrote about God's great mercy for sinners in a letter to Timothy. He said, "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners -- of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on Him and receive eternal life." (1st Timothy, 1:15-16)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Final Notes . . .</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">It is important that you seek spiritual direction from your priest or pastor regarding decisions about your family and the dreadful effects of artificial contraception. Please feel free to print a copy of this article to bring with you when you go to meet with your pastor. Ask him if he understands the destructive and sinful nature of the Pill and other forms of artificial contraception. And please remember, if you are a Catholic, the Catholic Church offers God's mercy and forgiveness in a beautiful way through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession). If you've committed a serious sin, you should go to confession right away. Priests are very understanding and they are there to help you. Confession is a great place to begin the process of forgiveness and healing.

With NFP, there are no drugs, no devices, no surgical procedures, no threat of death, no side effects and no chemical abortions. NFP is not the old Rhythm Method that was developed in the 1930's. NFP has been thoroughly tested and is proven to be highly effective. NFP is only recommended for married couples who have some burden (financial, emotional, health or other) causing them to need to space or limit the size of their family. It is suggested that you speak with your pastor or a spiritual director for spiritual guidance in this area.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Reports show NFP to be about 99% effective in determining when a woman is at the stage where she will conceive. This can help with trying to get pregnant as well as trying to avoid pregnancy.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Using NFP has been a blessing!

"Plan B is marketed as a contraceptive but even its proponents admit that it works both before and after conception," Ms. McQuade said.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Over-the-counter availability would allow these drugs to be used routinely, despite the fact that they are not approved for such use.

"Many are also unaware of their abortifacient action."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Women for whom the drug is dangerous would not have the benefit of any clinical advice to alert them to the risks," McQuade said. One physician who supports OTC availability of Plan B concedes that "repeated use of [emergency contraception] wreaks havoc on a woman's cycle" with "resulting menstrual chaos."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"It would also place additional pressure on pharmacists who conscientiously object to dispensing drugs that can kill humans at their earliest stages of development," Ms. McQuade continued.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"As surprising as it may seem to proponents of Plan B, a 2005 study co- authored by a Planned Parenthood doctor in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that having Plan B on hand did nothing to reduce pregnancy rates compared to those who obtained the drug from a pharmacy," McQuade noted.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities of the United States Conference </font></strong><a class="external free" title="http://www.usccb.org/prolife" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.usccb.org/prolife"><strong><font size="3">http://www.usccb.org/prolife</font></strong></a></p><hr /><p><br /><img height="125" alt="" width="102" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/2571511172.jpg" /></p><p><br /><strong><font size="4">The Abortifacient Effect of the Birth Control Pill</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Reading List and Internet URLs (last accessed 11-20-01: Alcorn/EPM info updated 6/21/05)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Walter L.

On the 30th anniversary of Humanae Vitae, the editors of this journal asked Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish thinkers to respond to the questions: (1) Do you judge the argument of Humanae Vitae convincing with respect to contraception? (2) How do you think the argument could have been made more convincingly? (3) In view of developments in the last thirty years, was Paul VI right about the moral and social consequences of contraception? (4) If you agree that the message of the encyclical has not been effectively communicated, why is that the case? </font></strong><a class="external free" title="http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9812/articles/contraception.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9812/articles/contraception.html"><strong><font size="3">http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9812/articles/contraception.html</font></strong></a></p><p><strong><font size="3">10) Crockett SA, DeCook J, Harrison D, Hersh C.

I tell them that there is an unknown risk but that risk can be reduced to a tolerable level through responsible pill taking."

Beginning on July 25 of 2007, Priests for Life will call attention to this special anniversary, and to the wisdom and insight of this important document. Respect for human life is the basis of civilization, and respect for life demands respect for the sources of life. We invite you to visit this page frequently during the year for updates and practical resources.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">There is a close link between abortion and contraception. Natural Family Planning, furthermore, provides a solution to both. The Encyclical Humanae Vitae has been and will remain a prophetic voice in the Church bearing witness to these truths. Pope John Paul II's Evangelium Vitae likewise explains the connection between abortion and contraception as "fruits of the same tree."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In their 2001 revision of the Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities ("A Campaign in Support of Life"), the United States Catholic Bishops speak of the connection between abortion and contraception in the following paragraphs:</font></strong></p><p><a class="new" title="Abortion and Contraception" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion_and_Contraception&amp;action=edit"><strong><font size="3">Abortion and Contraception</font></strong></a></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Church's teaching and pastoral efforts on responsible parenthood are appropriately treated more fully in other documents. However, we address the issue here, because some promote widespread use of contraception as a means to reduce abortions and even criticize the Church for not accepting this approach.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">It is noteworthy that as acceptance and use of contraception have increased in our society, so have acceptance and use of abortion. Couples who unintentionally conceive a child while using contraception are far more likely to resort to abortion than others. Tragically, our society has fallen into a mentality that views children as a burden and invites many to consider abortion as a "backup" to contraceptive failure. This is most obvious in efforts to promote as "emergency contraception" drugs that really act as early abortifacients.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3"><hr /></font></strong></p><p><br /><img height="292" alt="" width="200" src="/Portals/0/priest_pope_pics/200px-John_Paul_II_and_Benedict_XVI.jpg" /></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">With Pope John Paul II we affirm that contraception and abortion are "specifically different evils," because only "the latter destroys the life of a human being," but that they are also related (The Gospel of Life, no. 13). It is important to remember that means that are referred to as "contraceptive" are, in reality, sometimes also abortifacient. An end to abortion will not come from contraceptive campaigns but from a deeper understanding of our human sexuality, and of human life, as sacred gifts deserving our careful stewardship.</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">Priests for Life is committed to assisting the clergy to proclaim these realities.

In the Christian tradition, birth control had long been associated with promiscuity and adultery, and resolutely condemned. However, after the Anglican Church passed a resolution in favor of birth control at its 1930 Lambeth Conference, other Protestant denominations began to relax their prohibitions as well. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church held fast to its opposition.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Vatican's stand against contraception was centuries old. For much of that time, however, birth control had remained a dormant issue. Since most birth control consisted of folk remedies and homemade cervical caps, there was little cause for the Church to respond. It was the mass production and availability of rubber condoms and diaphragms in the 1920s and 1930s, made possible by the 1839 invention of vulcanized rubber, which eventually forced the Church to take a public position on specific contraceptives.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A Mortal Sin</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">On New Year's Eve 1930, the Roman Catholic Church officially banned any "artificial" means of birth control. Condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps were defined as artificial, since they blocked the natural journey of sperm during intercourse. Douches, suppositories and spermicides all killed or impeded sperm, and were banned as well. According to Church doctrine, tampering with the "male seed" was tantamount to murder. A common admonition on the subject at the time was "so many conceptions prevented, so many homicides." To interfere with God's will was a mortal sin and grounds for excommunication.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Purpose of Intercourse</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">For the Vatican, the primary purpose of intercourse was for the sacred act of procreation. If couples were interested in having intercourse, then they had to be willing to accept the potential for the creation of another life. For devout Catholics, that left only abstinence or the church-approved rhythm method (the practice of abstaining from sex during the woman's period of ovulation). However, the rhythm method was unreliable, and many believed it placed a heavy strain on marital relations.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A Reformist Climate</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">With the arrival of the birth control pill in 1960, many believed the Church was about to change the position it had held for centuries. The Church was in the midst of reform, and in this climate of modernization it seemed possible that the Vatican might bend on birth control. Since 1957, Church law had allowed women with "irregular" cycles to take the Pill to regularize their cycle and enable them to better practice the rhythm method. Approval of the contraceptive pill, many believed, was soon to follow.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Natural" Contraception</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Pro-Pill Catholics had a powerful ally on their side. John Rock, the eminent Catholic physician who had carried out Pill trials with Dr. Gregory Pincus, publicly argued that the Pill was merely an extension of the body's normal functioning. Since the Pill used the same hormones already present in the female reproductive system and did not tamper with sperm, Rock believed the Church should view the Pill as a "natural" form of contraception.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Vatican convened a commission to study the question of the Pill, but the Church would take eight years to determine its policy towards the Pill. In the interim, the Pill quickly became the most popular method of birth control among American women -- regardless of religion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="1">&#160;</font></strong></p><hr /><p>&#160;<img height="125" alt="" width="102" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/2571511172.jpg" /></p><p>&#160;<span class="story_title"><font style="background-color: #99ccff" color="#ffffff" size="4">Adventures in Pill Land</font></span></p><span class="story_title"><font size="4"><p align="center"><span class="author"><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/en/user/725"><font style="background-color: #99ccff" color="#ffffff" size="4">Nancy Guilfoy Valko RN</font></a></span></p></font></span><p><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/68643"><font color="#ffffff" size="1"><strong>http://www.catholiom/node/68643</strong></font></a><font color="#00ccff">&#160;</font></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><p><font size="3"><img height="140" alt="" width="141" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/images159951.jpg" /></font></p><p><strong><font size="3"><font color="#327d9a">Q.</font> Does the birth control pill increase your risk of breast cancer?<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 18px; color: #327d9a">A.</font> Since I am not a physician, in order to answer this question, I can only refer you to those who are:</font></strong></p><li><strong><font size="3">In a July 29th 2005 press release, the World Health Organization openly admitted that cobined estrogen-progestogen Oral Contraceptives are carcinogenic to humans. Specifically, they said that “Use of OC’s increases risk of breast, cervix, and liver cancer.” The data was presented by a working group of 21 scientists from 8 countries convened by the cancer research agency of the WHO, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The press release can be read </font></strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.iarc.fr/ENG/Press_Releases/pr167a.html"><strong><font size="3">here</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">The <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em> (PDR) is a 3500 page book used by doctors that explains how drugs work. In it is the “exact copy of the product’s FDA-approved or other manufacturer-supplied labeling.” The 2006 PDR states that “a meta-analysis of 54 studies found a small increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives or had used them within the past ten years.” Upon reading this, I tracked down the original source. It was an article from the Lancet, which gathered data from over 150,000 women. It said, “The studies included in this collaboration represent about 90% of the epidemiological information on the topic, and what is known about the other studies suggests that their omission has not materially affected the main conclusions.” Some might argue that the increase in breast cancer risk is only a small one. But with 80-100 million women on the pill across the globe, the numbers certainly add up. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">Most recently, in October 2006, the journal of the Mayo Clinic (<em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em>) published an article entitled </font></strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf/8110/8110a1.pdf"><strong><font size="3">“Oral Contraceptive Use as a Risk Factor for Pre-menopausal Breast Cancer: A Meta-analysis,”</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> authored by Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., et al. It revealed that 21 of 23 studies that followed women who took the pill prior to having their first child showed an increased risk of breast cancer. The increase was especially steep among younger women. Dr. Kahlenborn told WebMD, "Anyone who is prescribing oral contraceptives has a duty to tell women that 21 of 23 studies showed an increased risk." He added elsewhere that, “As more information comes out, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to suppress [the documented evidence from medical studies]. There’s a growing sense that it’s really just a matter of time before the lid blows on this thing. I think by the year 2010, we will start seeing a new attitude towards the pill, and it will be fueled by lawsuits.” </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">In the <em>Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs </em>it is stated that "Early-age use of the pill carries a greater risk of breast cancer, of developing larger tumors and having a worse prognosis"(2). The Pill can cause plenty of other problems as well, but click </font></strong><a href="http://www.pureloveclub.net/chastity/index.php?id=7&amp;entryid=124"><strong><font size="3">here </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">for details on that. <br /><br />
Many doctors do not believe there is a link between the Pill and breast cancer. But considering that the World Heath Organization, the 2006 <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em>, the journal of the Mayo Clinic, and other reliable sources openly admit such a connection, I believe there is reason for concern. Should a woman be prescribed the pill for medical reasons (as my wife was, with Endometriosis and ovarian tumors), she will be glad to know that successful alternatives exist.

You might wonder why the Pill would increase one's odds of developing breast cancer. Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., explains: "Two of the most important types of hormones that control reproduction are estrogens and progestins. Birth Control Pills are made from synthetic estrogens and/or progestins. Experiments have shown that these hormones cause women's breast cells to divide more rapidly, which makes them more easily affected by carcinogens - agents which cause cancer"(3). <br /><br />
To read more on breast cancer and the Pill, I'd recommend reading Dr. Kahlenborn's book, <em>Breast Cancer: Its Link to Abortion and the Birth Control Pill</em>. Also check out <em>A Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs</em> by John B.Wilks, Pharm. M.P.S. <br />

This book should be read by everyone interested in knowing the truth."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Paul L. Hayes, M.D., Board Certified Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians/Gynecologists</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">2. "Does the birth control pill cause abortions? Using research results from medical literature, Randy Alcorn has convincingly shown that the answer is `yes.' He has, with care and compassion, given us the truth. The question for us as Christians is how we will respond now that we know."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Linda Martin, M.D., Pediatrician</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">3. "By carefully detailing the available medical information concerning the abortifacient effects of oral contraceptives, Randy Alcorn has developed a logical and thoughtful challenge to every prolife person. The conclusions of this study are scientifically accurate. Birth control pills usually prevent pregnancy, but sometimes they cause an abortion. Questions? Objections? Randy has addressed them in a gentle but firm way. This is the manner in which the often fiery debate over prolife subjects should be carried out- unemotionally, intelligently and quietly. The evidence is before us . . . `How should we then live?'"</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Patrick D. Walker, M.D., Professor of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">4. "In this challenging book Randy Alcorn has the honesty to face a tough and uncomfortable question. This compelling evidence will make you rethink the question of birth control pills."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ John Brose, M.D., Surgeon</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">5. "In this impeccably researched book, Randy Alcorn takes an unblinking look at what medical experts know about how birth control pills work. I painfully agree that birth control pills do in fact cause abortions. Our individual and collective Christian response to this heretofore varnished-over information will have profound consequences for time and eternity. This is a disturbing must-read for all who profess to be prolife."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">~ Beverly A. McMillan, M.D., Ob/Gyn</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">6. "Randy Alcorn has done exceptional work. The facts in this book parallel much of my own research.

Most Americans are not aware that the Pill and other chemical "contraceptives" cause millions of "non-surgical" abortions each year in the early weeks of pregnancy. If you are using the Pill, Depo-Provera or Norplant, you need to know the truth about how these products work.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Most women take these "contraceptives" because they don't want to have a baby. But how many women know they can have BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS and become pregnant while using these "contraceptives?" Very few! And how many of these women know that if they become pregnant after a BREAKTHROUGH OVULATION, these "contraceptives" will almost always kill any son or daughter they've conceived?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Most people don't know the real facts about how "contraceptives" work. And because of this lack of knowledge, most women are not aware that they may be having BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS, and conceiving children that are killed very early in the pregnancy. Women using these "contraceptives" almost never perceive that they have become pregnant, or that chemicals have killed their tiny baby.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">What is Breakthrough Ovulation?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">While using the Pill and other chemical "birth control" products, many women's ovaries continue to release eggs. This is called "Breakthrough Ovulation" and it occurs in millions of women each year. Once an egg has been released via ovulation, a woman can become pregnant.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">You can still conceive a child . . .</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">If you're using "birth control" products and you have a breakthrough ovulation that releases an egg, sperm can then reach and fertilize your egg. At that moment -- you would be pregnant! Fertilization means conception has taken place and you now have a brand new son or daughter who is as complete genetically as he or she will ever be throughout life.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">When Does Human Life Begin?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Internationally-known geneticists and biologists have testified that human life begins at conception. In 1981 (April 23-24) a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings on the question: When does human life begin? The following doctors testified:</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Dr. Hymie Gordon, Chairman of the Department of Genetics at the Mayo Clinic, said: "By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Dr. McCarthy de Mere, a medical doctor and law professor at the University of Tennessee, testified: "The exact moment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Dr. Jerome Lejeune, The Father of Modern Genetics, testified that, "Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon we call the DNA."</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">The late Dr. Lejeune of Paris, France, discovered the genetic cause of Down Syndrome. He received the Kennedy Prize for this discovery, as well as the Memorial Allen Award Medal, the world's highest award for work in the field of Genetics.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">How does the Pill work?</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">The Pill has three mechanisms of action which can easily be looked up in the Physician's Desk Reference.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">1) Sometimes, the Pill suppresses ovulation. When this happens, an egg is not released and conception cannot occur. (It's important to read on and find out about the high rates of breakthrough ovulation. When ovulation is not suppressed, pregnancy can occur.)</font></strong></p><p align="center"><br /><strong><font size="3">2) The Pill also works to thicken the woman's cervical mucus which can "restrict" sperm from moving up the reproductive tract toward the egg.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><br /><strong><font size="3">3) One way the Pill causes early abortions is that it interfers with the flexing motions and the cilia movement of the fallopian tubes. These changes slow the transportation of newly conceived child from the fallopian tubes to the womb. Unfortunately, many small babies starve to death in the fallopian tubes because chemicals caused changes that prevented them from reaching the womb in time to be nourished.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">4) Another way the Pill causes early abortions: If your tiny baby survives the ride down the fallopian tube to your womb, the Pill will almost always cause the endometrium (the lining of your uterus) to reject your child. Chemical reactions often cause the lining of your womb to become thin, shriveled and unable to support implantation of your newly conceived child.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">This means that in almost every case, your new child will not be able to attach to the wall of your womb where he or she would normally live, grow and receive nourishment for 9 months. This means your tiny baby will starve to death and his or her remains will be passed along in your next bleeding cycle. (The "Study of Abortion Deaths Commission" estimates that this happens in women in America who use the Pill approximately 1 to 4 million times each year.)</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">The chemicals that cause these early abortions are called abortifacients which is the medical term for any chemical agent that causes an abortion.</font></strong></p><p align="center">&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><ul><li><div align="center"><strong><font color="#993300" size="4">For a comprehensive list of resources on the abortifacient effect of birth control</font></strong></div></li></ul><p align="center"><a class="external free" title="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html"><font color="#2861b5" size="2"><strong>http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html</strong></font></a></p><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p align="center"><img height="103" alt="" width="137" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/Depo-provera.jpg" /></p><p align="center"><img height="78" alt="" width="140" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/3795483148.jpg" /></p><p align="center"><br /><strong><font size="3">Depo-Provera, Norplant and IUDs</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Depo-Provera and Norplant both use chemicals that work in very simlar ways on a woman's body and womb. Depo-Provera and Norplant are also considered chemical abortifacients.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">IUDs or Intra-Uterine Devices, are small plastic devices that are inserted into the womb. Some IUDs contain copper or a time released hormone. It is believed that the IUD causes a low grade inflammation in the lining of the womb. As a result, the lining of the womb is imperfect and the fertilized egg will not implant. (Source: This paragraph on IUDs is quoted directly from the Calgary Regional Health Authority's web site.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Because of the chemical effect an IUD has on a woman's womb, tiny babies are aborted. Therefore, IUDs are also considered abortifacients.</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">Breakthrough ovulation proved long ago . . .</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Birth control advocates and manufacturers of the Pill have known these facts for years. Have they done a very good job of informing women about how the Pill really works? (Please email us and let us know if you were aware of how the Pill worked before you read this.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">When chemists devised the Pill that debuted in 1960, they gave it a huge dose of a chemical that caused most women's ovaries to stop secreting eggs (i.e., to stop ovulation). The theory was "no egg, no pregnancy."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">However, some women continued to release eggs and get pregnant while on the original Pill. (Studies have shown that an even higher percentage of women release eggs while using today's newer, re-formulated Pills. More about today's Pills in a moment.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In her award winning study of women taking the earlier high dose Pills, Dutch gynecologist Dr. Nine Van der Vange showed "proof of ovulation based on ultrasound exams and hormonal indicators occurred in about 4.7% of the cycles studied." (Source: Sterns, Dr. David, "How the Pill and the IUD Work: Gambling with Life," American Life League, PO Box 1350, Stafford, VA 22555)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">And the "Textbook of Contraceptive Practice" states that, "Among women who have been followed over a considerable number of cycles, breakthrough ovulations occur in 2 to 10 percent of cycles."

Peel &amp; Dr. Malcolm Potts, Textbook of Contraceptive Practice, 1969, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Please note that these references are to the lower breakthrough ovulation rates of the Pills of the 1960's. The new Pills of the 1990's work differently and have much higher breakthrough ovulation rates.

Let's look at the large pharmaceutical companies who advertise, market and sell the Pill. They make huge profits from the Pill -- and they'll continue to make mega-profits -- if women are convinced they're not getting pregnant and they keep buying and taking the Pill everyday.

Have they clearly explained that their products cause millions of early chemical abortions each year?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The New Pills: Much Higher Rates of Breakthrough Ovulation . . .</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The original Pill of the 1960's had to be modified due to harmful side effects that women were experiencing because of the powerful chemicals. All versions of today's "Combination Pill" have a reduced hormonal content. When compared to the Pills of the 1960's and 1970's, this reduces the chance of harmful side effects for women, but it also increases their chances of ovulating and conceiving a son or daughter.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Dr. Ronald Chez, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), publicly stated that the new Pills of today, with their lower estrogen dose, allow ovulation up to 50% of the time! (Source: Sterns, David, M.D., Sterns, Gina, R.N., B.S.N., Yaksich, Pamela, "Gambling with Life, How the I.U.D. and 'The Pill' Work" (www.top.net/vitalsigns).</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">With these newer Pills, simply missing one tablet, or failing to take the Pill at the same time each day increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation. Reactions with other drugs increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation, especially with caffeine and nicotine, or some prescription medicine (Source: "Abortifacient Contraception: The Pharmaceutical Holocaust" by Dr. Rudolf Ehmann, Human Life Intl., 1993, p.15).</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Makers of the new "mini-pill" claim it does not have the side effects of the combination pill. However, they don't tell you that scientific research shows the mini-pill does not stop ovulation at all in 67-81% of the women who use it, so the probability of conception is much higher.

Their new definition is absolutely untruthful and totally unscientific. They created this new definition of when a child is conceived to help them sell their products with the label "contraceptives." Their new definition says that conception occurs only when your baby successfully attaches to the lining of your uterus. THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The real medical truth.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">It's very important to understand that when a sperm penetrates one of your eggs, you have conceived a child. Again, this is called fertilization or conception and from that point on, you have a brand new, genetically complete son or daughter.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Every conception is a very unique moment. For example, at your own conception, 46 chromosomes with 30,000 genes combined to determine all your physical characteristics; sex, facial features, body type, color of hair, eyes and skin. Even more amazing, intelligence and personality -- the way you think and feel -- were already in place within your genetic code. At the moment of conception, you were essentially and uniquely "you." This is the same for every human being at the moment of conception.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Remember, the pharmaceutical industry has a multi-billion dollar business selling these abortifacients. Unfortunately, many of the people who prescribe these products are not aware of their homicidal properties. They may have a sincere desire to help women, but their lack of knowledge makes them uninformed accomplices to these early abortions.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">As recent as 25 years ago, most doctors took the Hippocratic Oath. They pledged never to perform an abortion. Tragically, many working in the medical profession today betray your trust by renouncing this ethic. Many know the truth but do not inform you that "birth control" devices are abortifacients which cause abortions.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Did you know abortion was defined in a Public Health Service document published by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare as follows:</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"All the measures which impair the viability of the zygote anytime between the instant of fertilization and the completion of labor constitute, in the strict sense, procedures for inducing abortion" (source: Public Health Service Leaflet no. 1066, US Dept of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1963, 27).

On that day, if you continue using chemical abortifacients after you read this information, He will ask you, "Why?"</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Why not stop today? Why not purify your soul by receiving God's healing Grace? God will forgive us for our past sins, no matter how serious they are, but only if we sincerely ask for His forgiveness with a humble, repentant heart, while also being firmly resolved not to commit the sin again.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Our God is merciful, forgiving and gracious to all who repent. No problem is so great that the God who created us cannot solve it.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Saint Paul wrote about God's great mercy for sinners in a letter to Timothy. He said, "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners -- of whom I am the worst.

And please remember, if you are a Catholic, the Catholic Church offers God's mercy and forgiveness in a beautiful way through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession). If you've committed a serious sin, you should go to confession right away. Priests are very understanding and they are there to help you. Confession is a great place to begin the process of forgiveness and healing. Go ahead and go today -- you'll feel like a ton of bricks was lifted off your shoulders.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Natural Family Planning . . .</font></strong></p><p><br /><font size="3"><img height="125" alt="" width="125" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/3881920941.jpg" /></font></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">Natural Family Planning (NFP) is a healthy alternative to artificial birth control. With NFP, there are no drugs, no devices, no surgical procedures, no threat of death, no side effects and no chemical abortions. NFP is not the old Rhythm Method that was developed in the 1930's. NFP has been thoroughly tested and is proven to be highly effective. NFP is only recommended for married couples who have some burden (financial, emotional, health or other) causing them to need to space or limit the size of their family. It is suggested that you speak with your pastor or a spiritual director for spiritual guidance in this area.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Reports show NFP to be about 99% effective in determining when a woman is at the stage where she will conceive. This can help with trying to get pregnant as well as trying to avoid pregnancy.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Using NFP has been a blessing!

"Plan B is marketed as a contraceptive but even its proponents admit that it works both before and after conception," Ms. McQuade said.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Over-the-counter availability would allow these drugs to be used routinely, despite the fact that they are not approved for such use. Studies presented to the FDA confirm that many women do not understand that the pills should not be used routinely," McQuade said. "Many are also unaware of their abortifacient action."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Women for whom the drug is dangerous would not have the benefit of any clinical advice to alert them to the risks," McQuade said. One physician who supports OTC availability of Plan B concedes that "repeated use of [emergency contraception] wreaks havoc on a woman's cycle" with "resulting menstrual chaos."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"It would also place additional pressure on pharmacists who conscientiously object to dispensing drugs that can kill humans at their earliest stages of development," Ms. McQuade continued.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"As surprising as it may seem to proponents of Plan B, a 2005 study co- authored by a Planned Parenthood doctor in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that having Plan B on hand did nothing to reduce pregnancy rates compared to those who obtained the drug from a pharmacy," McQuade noted.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities of the United States Conference </font></strong><a class="external free" title="http://www.usccb.org/prolife" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.usccb.org/prolife"><strong><font size="3">http://www.usccb.org/prolife</font></strong></a></p><hr /><p><br /><img height="125" alt="" width="102" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/2571511172.jpg" /></p><p><br /><strong><font size="4">The Abortifacient Effect of the Birth Control Pill</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Reading List and Internet URLs (last accessed 11-20-01: Alcorn/EPM info updated 6/21/05)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Walter L.

He predicts that there are 10 to 14 million abortions in the US, each year, of which only 1,500,000 are surgical abortions.

Beginning on July 25 of 2007, Priests for Life will call attention to this special anniversary, and to the wisdom and insight of this important document. Respect for human life is the basis of civilization, and respect for life demands respect for the sources of life. We invite you to visit this page frequently during the year for updates and practical resources.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">There is a close link between abortion and contraception. Natural Family Planning, furthermore, provides a solution to both. The Encyclical Humanae Vitae has been and will remain a prophetic voice in the Church bearing witness to these truths. Pope John Paul II's Evangelium Vitae likewise explains the connection between abortion and contraception as "fruits of the same tree."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In their 2001 revision of the Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities ("A Campaign in Support of Life"), the United States Catholic Bishops speak of the connection between abortion and contraception in the following paragraphs:</font></strong></p><p><a class="new" title="Abortion and Contraception" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion_and_Contraception&amp;action=edit"><strong><font size="3">Abortion and Contraception</font></strong></a></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Church's teaching and pastoral efforts on responsible parenthood are appropriately treated more fully in other documents. However, we address the issue here, because some promote widespread use of contraception as a means to reduce abortions and even criticize the Church for not accepting this approach.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">It is noteworthy that as acceptance and use of contraception have increased in our society, so have acceptance and use of abortion. Couples who unintentionally conceive a child while using contraception are far more likely to resort to abortion than others. Tragically, our society has fallen into a mentality that views children as a burden and invites many to consider abortion as a "backup" to contraceptive failure. This is most obvious in efforts to promote as "emergency contraception" drugs that really act as early abortifacients.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3"><hr /></font></strong></p><p><br /><img height="292" alt="" width="200" src="/Portals/0/priest_pope_pics/200px-John_Paul_II_and_Benedict_XVI.jpg" /></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">With Pope John Paul II we affirm that contraception and abortion are "specifically different evils," because only "the latter destroys the life of a human being," but that they are also related (The Gospel of Life, no. 13). It is important to remember that means that are referred to as "contraceptive" are, in reality, sometimes also abortifacient. An end to abortion will not come from contraceptive campaigns but from a deeper understanding of our human sexuality, and of human life, as sacred gifts deserving our careful stewardship.</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">Priests for Life is committed to assisting the clergy to proclaim these realities.

So even if the virus or bacteria doesn’t get through the condom itself, you can still get a disease, because condoms don’t cover all areas necessary to prevent infection during sexual contact.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Health Experts Say. . .</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Many leading health experts warn that you should not depend on condoms for protection against AIDS and other STDs:</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">“Simply put, condoms fail.

In the Christian tradition, birth control had long been associated with promiscuity and adultery, and resolutely condemned. However, after the Anglican Church passed a resolution in favor of birth control at its 1930 Lambeth Conference, other Protestant denominations began to relax their prohibitions as well. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church held fast to its opposition.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Vatican's stand against contraception was centuries old. For much of that time, however, birth control had remained a dormant issue. Since most birth control consisted of folk remedies and homemade cervical caps, there was little cause for the Church to respond. It was the mass production and availability of rubber condoms and diaphragms in the 1920s and 1930s, made possible by the 1839 invention of vulcanized rubber, which eventually forced the Church to take a public position on specific contraceptives.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A Mortal Sin</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">On New Year's Eve 1930, the Roman Catholic Church officially banned any "artificial" means of birth control. Condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps were defined as artificial, since they blocked the natural journey of sperm during intercourse. Douches, suppositories and spermicides all killed or impeded sperm, and were banned as well. According to Church doctrine, tampering with the "male seed" was tantamount to murder. A common admonition on the subject at the time was "so many conceptions prevented, so many homicides." To interfere with God's will was a mortal sin and grounds for excommunication.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Purpose of Intercourse</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">For the Vatican, the primary purpose of intercourse was for the sacred act of procreation. If couples were interested in having intercourse, then they had to be willing to accept the potential for the creation of another life. For devout Catholics, that left only abstinence or the church-approved rhythm method (the practice of abstaining from sex during the woman's period of ovulation). However, the rhythm method was unreliable, and many believed it placed a heavy strain on marital relations.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A Reformist Climate</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">With the arrival of the birth control pill in 1960, many believed the Church was about to change the position it had held for centuries. The Church was in the midst of reform, and in this climate of modernization it seemed possible that the Vatican might bend on birth control. Since 1957, Church law had allowed women with "irregular" cycles to take the Pill to regularize their cycle and enable them to better practice the rhythm method. Approval of the contraceptive pill, many believed, was soon to follow.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">"Natural" Contraception</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Pro-Pill Catholics had a powerful ally on their side. John Rock, the eminent Catholic physician who had carried out Pill trials with Dr. Gregory Pincus, publicly argued that the Pill was merely an extension of the body's normal functioning. Since the Pill used the same hormones already present in the female reproductive system and did not tamper with sperm, Rock believed the Church should view the Pill as a "natural" form of contraception.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Vatican convened a commission to study the question of the Pill, but the Church would take eight years to determine its policy towards the Pill. In the interim, the Pill quickly became the most popular method of birth control among American women -- regardless of religion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="1">&#160;</font></strong></p><hr /><p>&#160;<img height="125" alt="" width="102" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/2571511172.jpg" /></p><p>&#160;<span class="story_title"><font style="background-color: #99ccff" color="#ffffff" size="4">Adventures in Pill Land</font></span></p><span class="story_title"><font size="4"><p align="center"><span class="author"><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/en/user/725"><font style="background-color: #99ccff" color="#ffffff" size="4">Nancy Guilfoy Valko RN</font></a></span></p></font></span><p><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/68643"><font color="#ffffff" size="1"><strong>http://www.catholiom/node/68643</strong></font></a><font color="#00ccff">&#160;</font></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><p><font size="3"><img height="140" alt="" width="141" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/images159951.jpg" /></font></p><p><strong><font size="3"><font color="#327d9a">Q.</font> Does the birth control pill increase your risk of breast cancer?<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 18px; color: #327d9a">A.</font> Since I am not a physician, in order to answer this question, I can only refer you to those who are:</font></strong></p><li><strong><font size="3">In a July 29th 2005 press release, the World Health Organization openly admitted that cobined estrogen-progestogen Oral Contraceptives are carcinogenic to humans. Specifically, they said that “Use of OC’s increases risk of breast, cervix, and liver cancer.” The data was presented by a working group of 21 scientists from 8 countries convened by the cancer research agency of the WHO, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The press release can be read </font></strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.iarc.fr/ENG/Press_Releases/pr167a.html"><strong><font size="3">here</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">The <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em> (PDR) is a 3500 page book used by doctors that explains how drugs work. In it is the “exact copy of the product’s FDA-approved or other manufacturer-supplied labeling.” The 2006 PDR states that “a meta-analysis of 54 studies found a small increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives or had used them within the past ten years.” Upon reading this, I tracked down the original source. It was an article from the Lancet, which gathered data from over 150,000 women. It said, “The studies included in this collaboration represent about 90% of the epidemiological information on the topic, and what is known about the other studies suggests that their omission has not materially affected the main conclusions.” Some might argue that the increase in breast cancer risk is only a small one. But with 80-100 million women on the pill across the globe, the numbers certainly add up. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">Most recently, in October 2006, the journal of the Mayo Clinic (<em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em>) published an article entitled </font></strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf/8110/8110a1.pdf"><strong><font size="3">“Oral Contraceptive Use as a Risk Factor for Pre-menopausal Breast Cancer: A Meta-analysis,”</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> authored by Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., et al. It revealed that 21 of 23 studies that followed women who took the pill prior to having their first child showed an increased risk of breast cancer. The increase was especially steep among younger women. Dr. Kahlenborn told WebMD, "Anyone who is prescribing oral contraceptives has a duty to tell women that 21 of 23 studies showed an increased risk." He added elsewhere that, “As more information comes out, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to suppress [the documented evidence from medical studies]. There’s a growing sense that it’s really just a matter of time before the lid blows on this thing. I think by the year 2010, we will start seeing a new attitude towards the pill, and it will be fueled by lawsuits.” </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">In the <em>Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs </em>it is stated that "Early-age use of the pill carries a greater risk of breast cancer, of developing larger tumors and having a worse prognosis"(2). The Pill can cause plenty of other problems as well, but click </font></strong><a href="http://www.pureloveclub.net/chastity/index.php?id=7&amp;entryid=124"><strong><font size="3">here </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">for details on that. <br /><br />
Many doctors do not believe there is a link between the Pill and breast cancer. But considering that the World Heath Organization, the 2006 <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em>, the journal of the Mayo Clinic, and other reliable sources openly admit such a connection, I believe there is reason for concern. Should a woman be prescribed the pill for medical reasons (as my wife was, with Endometriosis and ovarian tumors), she will be glad to know that successful alternatives exist.

You might wonder why the Pill would increase one's odds of developing breast cancer. Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., explains: "Two of the most important types of hormones that control reproduction are estrogens and progestins. Birth Control Pills are made from synthetic estrogens and/or progestins. Experiments have shown that these hormones cause women's breast cells to divide more rapidly, which makes them more easily affected by carcinogens - agents which cause cancer"(3). <br /><br />
