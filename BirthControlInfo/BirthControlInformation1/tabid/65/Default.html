Research shows that in many cases the Pill causes early abortions -- abortions the mother may not even know she's having. You may find this shocking, but the facts are clear after reading Randy Alcorn's book, titled;</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">"Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?"</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Here's what 11 physicians and medical professionals are saying about the book Randy Alcorn published in 1998:</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">1. "From medical textbooks and pharmacy references, to statements from the Pill-manufacturers themselves, this book proves, beyond any doubt, the abortion-causing action of birth control pills. This book should be read by everyone interested in knowing the truth."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">~ Paul L. Hayes, M.D., Board Certified Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians/Gynecologists</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">2. "Does the birth control pill cause abortions? Using research results from medical literature, Randy Alcorn has convincingly shown that the answer is `yes.' He has, with care and compassion, given us the truth. The question for us as Christians is how we will respond now that we know."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">~ Linda Martin, M.D., Pediatrician</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">3. "By carefully detailing the available medical information concerning the abortifacient effects of oral contraceptives, Randy Alcorn has developed a logical and thoughtful challenge to every prolife person. The conclusions of this study are scientifically accurate. Birth control pills usually prevent pregnancy, but sometimes they cause an abortion. Questions? Objections? Randy has addressed them in a gentle but firm way. This is the manner in which the often fiery debate over prolife subjects should be carried out- unemotionally, intelligently and quietly. The evidence is before us . . . `How should we then live?'"</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">~ Patrick D. Walker, M.D., Professor of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">4. "In this challenging book Randy Alcorn has the honesty to face a tough and uncomfortable question. This compelling evidence will make you rethink the question of birth control pills."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">~ John Brose, M.D., Surgeon</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">5. "In this impeccably researched book, Randy Alcorn takes an unblinking look at what medical experts know about how birth control pills work. I painfully agree that birth control pills do in fact cause abortions. Our individual and collective Christian response to this heretofore varnished-over information will have profound consequences for time and eternity. This is a disturbing must-read for all who profess to be prolife."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">~ Beverly A. McMillan, M.D., Ob/Gyn</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">6. "Randy Alcorn has done exceptional work.

This book is a must for Christians, particularly those in medicine and Christian ministries."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">~ Karen D. Garnett, R.N.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">7.

"Scientific papers suggest that escape ovulation occurs 4-15% of all cycles in patients taking birth control pills.

Most Americans are not aware that the Pill and other chemical "contraceptives" cause millions of "non-surgical" abortions each year in the early weeks of pregnancy. If you are using the Pill, Depo-Provera or Norplant, you need to know the truth about how these products work.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Most women take these "contraceptives" because they don't want to have a baby. But how many women know they can have BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS and become pregnant while using these "contraceptives?" Very few! And how many of these women know that if they become pregnant after a BREAKTHROUGH OVULATION, these "contraceptives" will almost always kill any son or daughter they've conceived?</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Most people don't know the real facts about how "contraceptives" work. And because of this lack of knowledge, most women are not aware that they may be having BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS, and conceiving children that are killed very early in the pregnancy. Women using these "contraceptives" almost never perceive that they have become pregnant, or that chemicals have killed their tiny baby.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span>&#160;</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></p><p align="center"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">What is Breakthrough Ovulation?</span></strong></span></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">While using the Pill and other chemical "birth control" products, many women's ovaries continue to release eggs.

In 1981 (April 23-24) a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings on the question: When does human life begin? The following doctors testified:</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Dr. Hymie Gordon, Chairman of the Department of Genetics at the Mayo Clinic, said: "By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Dr. McCarthy de Mere, a medical doctor and law professor at the University of Tennessee, testified: "The exact moment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Dr. Jerome Lejeune, The Father of Modern Genetics, testified that, "Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon we call the DNA."</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The late Dr. Lejeune of Paris, France, discovered the genetic cause of Down Syndrome. He received the Kennedy Prize for this discovery, as well as the Memorial Allen Award Medal, the world's highest award for work in the field of Genetics.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center">&#160;</p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"> </span></p><p align="center">&#160;<strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="center"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">How does the Pill work?</span></strong></span></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></p><p align="center">&#160;<span style="font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The Pill has three mechanisms of action which can easily be looked up in the Physician's Desk Reference.</span></strong></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">1) Sometimes, the Pill suppresses ovulation. When this happens, an egg is not released and conception cannot occur. (It's important to read on and find out about the high rates of breakthrough ovulation. When ovulation is not suppressed, pregnancy can occur.)</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
2) The Pill also works to thicken the woman's cervical mucus which can "restrict" sperm from moving up the reproductive tract toward the egg.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
3) One way the Pill causes early abortions is that it interfers with the flexing motions and the cilia movement of the fallopian tubes. These changes slow the transportation of newly conceived child from the fallopian tubes to the womb. Unfortunately, many small babies starve to death in the fallopian tubes because chemicals caused changes that prevented them from reaching the womb in time to be nourished.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">4) Another way the Pill causes early abortions: If your tiny baby survives the ride down the fallopian tube to your womb, the Pill will almost always cause the endometrium (the lining of your uterus) to reject your child. Chemical reactions often cause the lining of your womb to become thin, shriveled and unable to support implantation of your newly conceived child.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">This means that in almost every case, your new child will not be able to attach to the wall of your womb where he or she would normally live, grow and receive nourishment for 9 months. This means your tiny baby will starve to death and his or her remains will be passed along in your next bleeding cycle. (The "Study of Abortion Deaths Commission" estimates that this happens in women in America who use the Pill approximately 1 to 4 million times each year.)</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The chemicals that cause these early abortions are called abortifacients which is the medical term for any chemical agent that causes an abortion.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;<strong><font size="4" color="#993300">For a comprehensive list of resources on the abortifacient effect of birth control</font></strong></p><p align="center"><a class="external free" title="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><font color="#2861b5">http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html</font></span></strong></a></p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img width="137" height="103" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/Depo-provera.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: center; "><img width="140" height="78" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/3795483148.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: center; "><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /><strong>Depo-Provera, Norplant and IUDs</strong></span></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Depo-Provera and Norplant both use chemicals that work in very simlar ways on a woman's body and womb. Depo-Provera and Norplant are also considered chemical abortifacients.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">IUDs or Intra-Uterine Devices, are small plastic devices that are inserted into the womb. Some IUDs contain copper or a time released hormone. It is believed that the IUD causes a low grade inflammation in the lining of the womb. As a result, the lining of the womb is imperfect and the fertilized egg will not implant. (Source: This paragraph on IUDs is quoted directly from the Calgary Regional Health Authority's web site.)</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of the chemical effect an IUD has on a woman's womb, tiny babies are aborted. Therefore, IUDs are also considered abortifacients.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
Breakthrough ovulation proved long ago . . .</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Birth control advocates and manufacturers of the Pill have known these facts for years. Have they done a very good job of informing women about how the Pill really works? (Please email us and let us know if you were aware of how the Pill worked before you read this.)</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When chemists devised the Pill that debuted in 1960, they gave it a huge dose of a chemical that caused most women's ovaries to stop secreting eggs (i.e., to stop ovulation). The theory was "no egg, no pregnancy."</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">However, some women continued to release eggs and get pregnant while on the original Pill. (Studies have shown that an even higher percentage of women release eggs while using today's newer, re-formulated Pills. More about today's Pills in a moment.)</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In her award winning study of women taking the earlier high dose Pills, Dutch gynecologist Dr. Nine Van der Vange showed "proof of ovulation based on ultrasound exams and hormonal indicators occurred in about 4.7% of the cycles studied." (Source: Sterns, Dr. David, "How the Pill and the IUD Work: Gambling with Life," American Life League, PO Box 1350, Stafford, VA 22555)</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And the "Textbook of Contraceptive Practice" states that, "Among women who have been followed over a considerable number of cycles, breakthrough ovulations occur in 2 to 10 percent of cycles." (Source: Dr. J.

Let's look at the large pharmaceutical companies who advertise, market and sell the Pill. They make huge profits from the Pill -- and they'll continue to make mega-profits -- if women are convinced they're not getting pregnant and they keep buying and taking the Pill everyday.

All versions of today's "Combination Pill" have a reduced hormonal content. When compared to the Pills of the 1960's and 1970's, this reduces the chance of harmful side effects for women, but it also increases their chances of ovulating and conceiving a son or daughter.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Dr. Ronald Chez, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), publicly stated that the new Pills of today, with their lower estrogen dose, allow ovulation up to 50% of the time!

Natural Family Planning (NFP) is a healthy alternative to artificial birth control.

NFP has been thoroughly tested and is proven to be highly effective. NFP is only recommended for married couples who have some burden (financial, emotional, health or other) causing them to need to space or limit the size of their family. It is suggested that you speak with your pastor or a spiritual director for spiritual guidance in this area.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Reports show NFP to be about 99% effective in determining when a woman is at the stage where she will conceive.

However, the review also concluded, "...there are insufficient data to quantitate the relative contribution of postfertilization effects" Nevertheless, the authors suggest, "...the principles of informed consent suggest that patients who may object to any postfertilization loss should be made aware of this information so that they can give fully informed consent for the use of the pill." </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a class="external free" title="http://archfami.ama-assn.org/issues/v9n2/ffull/fsa8035.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://archfami.ama-assn.org/issues/v9n2/ffull/fsa8035.html"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">http://archfami.ama-assn.org/issues/v9n2/ffull/fsa8035.html</span></strong></a><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> (available online only for AMA members) Sherfey MA.

Priests for Life Announces Year-Long Preparation for 40th Anniversary of Humanae Vitae</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>July 25, 2008 will be the 40th anniversary of Pope Paul VI’s encyclical letter Humanae Vitae. Beginning on July 25 of 2007, Priests for Life will call attention to this special anniversary, and to the wisdom and insight of this important document. Respect for human life is the basis of civilization, and respect for life demands respect for the sources of life. We invite you to visit this page frequently during the year for updates and practical resources.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>There is a close link between abortion and contraception. Natural Family Planning, furthermore, provides a solution to both. The Encyclical Humanae Vitae has been and will remain a prophetic voice in the Church bearing witness to these truths. Pope John Paul II's Evangelium Vitae likewise explains the connection between abortion and contraception as "fruits of the same tree."</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>In their 2001 revision of the Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities ("A Campaign in Support of Life"), the United States Catholic Bishops speak of the connection between abortion and contraception in the following paragraphs:</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a class="new" title="Abortion and Contraception" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion_and_Contraception&amp;action=edit"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Abortion and Contraception</span></span></a></span></span></p><span style="font-size: medium;"><p>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>The Church's teaching and pastoral efforts on responsible parenthood are appropriately treated more fully in other documents. However, we address the issue here, because some promote widespread use of contraception as a means to reduce abortions and even criticize the Church for not accepting this approach.</strong></span></p></span><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>It is noteworthy that as acceptance and use of contraception have increased in our society, so have acceptance and use of abortion. Couples who unintentionally conceive a child while using contraception are far more likely to resort to abortion than others. Tragically, our society has fallen into a mentality that views children as a burden and invites many to consider abortion as a "backup" to contraceptive failure. This is most obvious in efforts to promote as "emergency contraception" drugs that really act as early abortifacients.</strong></span></span></p><p><br /><img width="200" height="292" alt="" src="/Portals/0/priest_pope_pics/200px-John_Paul_II_and_Benedict_XVI.jpg" /></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><br />
With Pope John Paul II we affirm that contraception and abortion are "specifically different evils," because only "the latter destroys the life of a human being," but that they are also related (The Gospel of Life, no. 13). It is important to remember that means that are referred to as "contraceptive" are, in reality, sometimes also abortifacient. An end to abortion will not come from contraceptive campaigns but from a deeper understanding of our human sexuality, and of human life, as sacred gifts deserving our careful stewardship.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><br />

While using a condom, you can still become pregnant. Condoms have an annual contraceptive failure rate of 18.4 percent for girls under age 18.

In the Christian tradition, birth control had long been associated with promiscuity and adultery, and resolutely condemned. However, after the Anglican Church passed a resolution in favor of birth control at its 1930 Lambeth Conference, other Protestant denominations began to relax their prohibitions as well. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church held fast to its opposition.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Vatican's stand against contraception was centuries old. For much of that time, however, birth control had remained a dormant issue. Since most birth control consisted of folk remedies and homemade cervical caps, there was little cause for the Church to respond. It was the mass production and availability of rubber condoms and diaphragms in the 1920s and 1930s, made possible by the 1839 invention of vulcanized rubber, which eventually forced the Church to take a public position on specific contraceptives.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A Mortal Sin</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On New Year's Eve 1930, the Roman Catholic Church officially banned any "artificial" means of birth control. Condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps were defined as artificial, since they blocked the natural journey of sperm during intercourse. Douches, suppositories and spermicides all killed or impeded sperm, and were banned as well. According to Church doctrine, tampering with the "male seed" was tantamount to murder. A common admonition on the subject at the time was "so many conceptions prevented, so many homicides." To interfere with God's will was a mortal sin and grounds for excommunication.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Purpose of Intercourse</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">For the Vatican, the primary purpose of intercourse was for the sacred act of procreation. If couples were interested in having intercourse, then they had to be willing to accept the potential for the creation of another life. For devout Catholics, that left only abstinence or the church-approved rhythm method (the practice of abstaining from sex during the woman's period of ovulation). However, the rhythm method was unreliable, and many believed it placed a heavy strain on marital relations.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A Reformist Climate</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">With the arrival of the birth control pill in 1960, many believed the Church was about to change the position it had held for centuries. The Church was in the midst of reform, and in this climate of modernization it seemed possible that the Vatican might bend on birth control. Since 1957, Church law had allowed women with "irregular" cycles to take the Pill to regularize their cycle and enable them to better practice the rhythm method. Approval of the contraceptive pill, many believed, was soon to follow.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"Natural" Contraception</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Pro-Pill Catholics had a powerful ally on their side. John Rock, the eminent Catholic physician who had carried out Pill trials with Dr. Gregory Pincus, publicly argued that the Pill was merely an extension of the body's normal functioning. Since the Pill used the same hormones already present in the female reproductive system and did not tamper with sperm, Rock believed the Church should view the Pill as a "natural" form of contraception.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Vatican convened a commission to study the question of the Pill, but the Church would take eight years to determine its policy towards the Pill. In the interim, the Pill quickly became the most popular method of birth control among American women -- regardless of religion.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><img width="102" height="125" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/2571511172.jpg" /></p><p><table align="center" width="98%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="0"><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p align="center">&#160;</p><p align="center"><span class="author"><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/en/user/725"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">Nancy Guilfoy Valko RN</font></a></span></p></td><td align="right" rowspan="2"><p align="center"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">&#160;</font></p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">&#160;</font></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p align="center"><span class="story_title"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">Adventures in Pill Land</font></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/68643"><strong><font color="#ff6600">http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/68643</font></strong></a><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><img width="141" height="140" alt="" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/images159951.jpg" /></p><p><font size="4" color="#327d9a">Q.</font> <strong>Does the birth control pill increase your risk of breast cancer?</strong><br /><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /><font style="font-size: 18px; color: #327d9a">A.</font> Since I am not a physician, in order to answer this question, I can only refer you to those who are:</span></span></strong></p><ul><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In a July 29th 2005 press release, the World Health Organization openly admitted that cobined estrogen-progestogen Oral Contraceptives are carcinogenic to humans. Specifically, they said that “Use of OC’s increases risk of breast, cervix, and liver cancer.” The data was presented by a working group of 21 scientists from 8 countries convened by the cancer research agency of the WHO, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The press release can be read </span></span></strong><strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.iarc.fr/ENG/Press_Releases/pr167a.html"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">.</span></span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em> (PDR) is a 3500 page book used by doctors that explains how drugs work. In it is the “exact copy of the product’s FDA-approved or other manufacturer-supplied labeling.” The 2006 PDR states that “a meta-analysis of 54 studies found a small increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives or had used them within the past ten years.” Upon reading this, I tracked down the original source. It was an article from the Lancet, which gathered data from over 150,000 women. It said, “The studies included in this collaboration represent about 90% of the epidemiological information on the topic, and what is known about the other studies suggests that their omission has not materially affected the main conclusions.” Some might argue that the increase in breast cancer risk is only a small one. But with 80-100 million women on the pill across the globe, the numbers certainly add up.</span></span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most recently, in October 2006, the journal of the Mayo Clinic (<em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em>) published an article entitled </span></span></strong><strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf/8110/8110a1.pdf"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">“Oral Contraceptive Use as a Risk Factor for Pre-menopausal Breast Cancer: A Meta-analysis,”</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> authored by Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., et al. It revealed that 21 of 23 studies that followed women who took the pill prior to having their first child showed an increased risk of breast cancer. The increase was especially steep among younger women. Dr. Kahlenborn told WebMD, "Anyone who is prescribing oral contraceptives has a duty to tell women that 21 of 23 studies showed an increased risk." He added elsewhere that, “As more information comes out, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to suppress [the documented evidence from medical studies]. There’s a growing sense that it’s really just a matter of time before the lid blows on this thing. I think by the year 2010, we will start seeing a new attitude towards the pill, and it will be fueled by lawsuits.”</span></span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In the <em>Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs </em>it is stated that "Early-age use of the pill carries a greater risk of breast cancer, of developing larger tumors and having a worse prognosis"(2).

But considering that the World Heath Organization, the 2006 <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em>, the journal of the Mayo Clinic, and other reliable sources openly admit such a connection, I believe there is reason for concern. Should a woman be prescribed the pill for medical reasons (as my wife was, with Endometriosis and ovarian tumors), she will be glad to know that successful alternatives exist.

Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., explains: "Two of the most important types of hormones that control reproduction are estrogens and progestins. Birth Control Pills are made from synthetic estrogens and/or progestins. Experiments have shown that these hormones cause women's breast cells to divide more rapidly, which makes them more easily affected by carcinogens - agents which cause cancer"(3). <br /><br />To read more on breast cancer and the Pill, I'd recommend reading Dr. Kahlenborn's book, <em>Breast Cancer: Its Link to Abortion and the Birth Control Pill</em>.

It is the union of an egg and sperm — an embryo.&#160; Such is God's way.&#160; He takes something smaller than a mustard seed and brings forth all of civilization. &#160;After creating everything in the universe single-handedly, He created us in his own image and bestowed upon us the power to become co-creators with Him. &#160;Working in union with us, when the sperm unites with the egg, not only has a new human life been set in motion, but so too has a spiritual life.&#160; God places an everlasting soul into the being of every son and daughter.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of us rarely think that deeply about it all. &#160;In our worldly way, we forget eternity and begin to affix costs — physical, emotional and monetary.&#160; The costs can seem exorbitant when we focus only through the eyes of the world. &#160;And looking through those same worldly eyes, the way to prevent the miracle we clearly do not recognize as such is so easy, inexpensive, and ironically, also so small — the birth control pill.&#160; But the pill does not just prevent the miracle, it also destroys it,&#160;a fact that is often surprising to committed pro-lifers.&#160; This fact is true for all contraception that works through manipulation of hormone levels.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">History</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The pill has become a symbol of freedom to those who have been told they can "have it all".&#160; And it has become a symbol of destruction to those who support a "Theology of the Body," philosophy, the essence of Catholic teaching that artificial means must not disrupt God's natural order of things.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The first birth control pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 1960.&#160; Using a synthetic estrogen hormone, the pill tricked a women's body into thinking it was pregnant.&#160; No egg would be released thereby preventing the opportunity for conception.&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the pill was initially introduced with the idea of affording women a reliable way of limiting their family size, it soon became the ticket to the Sexual Revolution that began in the Sixties and never really ended.&#160; The pill promised something it's never been able to deliver: sex with "no strings attached". &#160;There are always emotional and moral consequences to thwarting God's purpose, but women discovered physical problems too. &#160;Blood clots, heart attacks and strokes were some of the side effects caused by the Pill's high estrogen levels.&#160; Drug manufacturers lowered these levels in order to reduce the side effects but that also increased the incidence of breakthrough ovulation.&#160; With the lower levels of estrogen, eggs would sometimes still get released and pregnancies resulted.&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The drug companies tackled this situation by adding the synthetic hormone progesterone, which makes the uterine wall (the endometrium) inhospitable to implantation by an embryo. &#160;So if an egg was released and became fertilized by a sperm, thus creating life, the pill would have actually failed to prevent a conception, meaning it failed as a contraceptive.&#160; But, through preventing implantation of the embryo, the pill acts as an abortifacient and stops life from continuing to the next stage.&#160; (A clear and simple demonstration of this can be seen </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiCU46_lWeE"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">.)</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since some women actually do become pregnant while on the pill, there are some embryos that manage to implant into the uterus. &#160;Whether it's RU-486, Norplant, Depo-Provera, the morning after pill, the Mini-pill, or the Pill, there is no chemical "contraceptive" that&#160;<em>always </em>causes an abortion.&#160; There is also none that <em>never</em> causes an abortion<em>.</em></span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ignorance</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no way of knowing what percentage of pregnancies result in abortion through the pill.&#160; The woman using the pill with this scenario never even knows that she conceived a child.&#160; Her cycle will continue on schedule with no realization that an embryo is being flushed from her body.&#160; The Catholic Church has never wavered on the teaching that life begins at conception.&#160; Although Catholics are contracepting at rates parallel to non-Catholics, using artificial means to change our body's natural functions in order to block the potential for life has been recognized as rebellion against God's plan for humanity.&#160; However, using natural means to understand the rhythms of life and then to work in union with God is encouraged through Natural Family Planning.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The issue of birth control is a big one where misunderstanding and ignorance often misguide people.&#160; But when it comes to the pill, the ignorance that many women fall prey to is lack of understanding of its abortifacient properties.&#160; Most women don't consider that while taking their birth control, they may also be aborting a life within them.&#160; As Pope Paul VI predicted when he issued his encyclical <em>Humanae Vitae</em> (<em>Of Human Life</em>) in 1968, the use of artificial contraception would lead to abortions.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it seemed to many to be an overdramatic prediction, it proved to be prophetic.&#160; In hindsight, its logic in saying that widespread use of contraception would lead to "conjugal infidelity and the general lowering of morality"&#160;was prophetic. &#160;Since the Pill began to be sold in 1960, divorces have tripled, out-of-wedlock births jumped from 224,000 to 1.2 million, abortions doubled, and cohabitation soared 10-fold from 430,000 to 4.2 million.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sex both inside and outside marriage ceased to be about a bond of marital love in which a couple became one in union with God.&#160; It became merely an activity for personal satisfaction devoid of anything more.&#160; The Pope predicted man would lose respect for woman, considering her "as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment, and no longer as his respected and beloved companion."</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Society as a whole moved from recognizing sex as something reserved for married couples to something for everyone, since the possibility for pregnancy was greatly reduced (although never completely removed).&#160; Thus, people completely opposed to having children could have sex with others whom they had chosen as bed partners but would never chose to co-parent their children.&#160; The most intimate experience intended to be shared in love and self-giving with the potential for creating life became merely a form of recreation.&#160; And if life sprang forth, such a life was easily regarded as nothing more than an unintended problem that could legally be disposed of through abortion.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But women choosing abortion and the men who either make that choice with them or plead for them to do otherwise, are very aware of the decision that is being made, whereas women who choose to take birth control pills are not so aware of the potential ramifications of their choice.&#160; There is not a baby with a heartbeat who must forcefully be removed, but unbeknownst to many, there <em>is</em> a baby.&#160; Since life begins at conception, a life, even though undetectable to us, is still a life.&#160; It is the way God chooses to begin things, small and yet mighty in its eternal existence.&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition to the pill, IUDs, Depo-Provera and Norplant also cause early, undetectable abortions.&#160;&#160;Doctor usually fail to warn women of the abortifacient properties of the pill.&#160; I've heard some doctors admit they were not actually even aware of these properties.&#160;&#160;Women often choose contraception as a means to avoid pregnancy without realizing they are not actually stopping pregnancy, but quickly ending it.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Denial</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In his booklet, titled <em>Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?</em>, Randy Alcorn states: "The question of whether it causes abortions has direct bearing on untold millions of Christians, many of them pro-life, who use and recommend it. &#160;For those who believe God is the Creator of each person and the giver and taker of human life, this is a question with profound moral implications."</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Alcorn was a Protestant pastor who not only used the pill in his married life, but also counseled other married couples to do so.&#160; He had a vested interest in <em>not</em> recognizing the pill as an abortifactient.&#160; But when confronted with the facts through his own research, it demanded changes in his own behavior and philosophy.&#160; His </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.epm.org/articles/bcp5400.html#_edn31"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">booklet</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> was written in 1998 to inform others of the truth.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Alcorn's booklet has met some opposition.&#160; According to him: "Despite evidence, some pro-life physicians state that the likelihood of the Pill having an abortifacient effect is infinitesimally low, or nonexistent. </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.epm.org/articles/bcp5400.html#_edn31"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Though I would very much like to believe this, the scientific evidence does not permit me to do so."</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Alcorn, surprisingly, found that the greatest resistance to recognizing the abortifacient quality of the pill comes from the Christian community.&#160; "Dr. Walt Larimore has told me that whenever he has presented this evidence to audiences of secular physicians, there has been little or no resistance to it.&#160; But when he has presented it to Christian physicians there has been substantial resistance. &#160;Since secular physicians do not care whether the Pill prevents implantation, they tend to be objective in interpreting the evidence. &#160;After all, they have little or nothing at stake either way.&#160; Christian physicians, however, very much do not want to believe the Pill causes early abortions. &#160;Therefore, I believe, they tend to resist the evidence. &#160;This is certainly understandable. &#160;Nonetheless, we should not permit what we<em> want </em>to believe to distract us from what the evidence indicates we <em>should</em> believe."&#160;&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It's easier to be pro-life when we limit the discussion to the abortion industry.&#160; The inclusion of artificial birth control complicates and confuses people.&#160; With so many opinions even among Catholics, how is a person to know what to believe?&#160; I understand the confusion.&#160; While living in Montana, I had a doctor who was also a priest, who told me it was not realistic to expect a couple to follow the Catholic teaching on birth control.&#160; He prescribed birth control pills to many of his female patients.&#160; So, is it any surprise there are many Catholics, ones like me, ignorant of the true teaching?</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Yet, we must cut through the false teachings and erroneous opinions to reach the truth.&#160;

CHERRY HILL, N.J. (CNS) -- Mark W. LeChevallier agrees with Dr. Lester Ruppersberger, a pro-life obstetrician and gynecologist, that natural family planning is safe, healthy and effective. But he would add one more characteristic: It's environmentally responsible.<br /><br />
LeChevallier is director of innovation and environmental stewardship at American Water, the largest water and wastewater provider in North America. Along with his wife, he also has been a certified instructor of natural family planning for the past 25 years.<br /><br />
In separate talks July 26 to a national conference in Cherry Hill, LeChevallier and Ruppersberger approached the topic of natural family planning from very different directions but reached similarly positive conclusions.<br /><br />
The July 25-27 conference brought together leaders from diocesan pro-life, family life and social justice offices around the country.<br /><br />
Ruppersberger's talk on "Scientific Advances in Fertility Management" touted the benefits he has seen for his patients and himself since he switched to an NFP-only medical practice in 1999.<br /><br />
LeChevallier shared the podium with Roxana U. Barillas, a domestic policy adviser at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, for a discussion on "Toxins, the Environment and the Child in the Womb." He spoke about the drastic effects that discarded contraceptive medicines and devices have been having on the nation's water and animals, especially fish.<br /><br />
In a talk with the daunting title of "Endocrine Disruptions: Chemical Contraceptives in Sewage Effluents," LeChevallier explained that like secondhand smoke, "secondhand estrogens are being released into the environment," to devastating effect on fish, panthers, alligators and other wildlife.<br /><br />
He said the media "did a little bit of a disservice" to the American public when they reported earlier this year that the levels of contaminants found in drinking water could seriously harm humans.<br /><br />
For example, "you would have to drink 100 million gallons to get the dose found in one Tylenol," he said.<br /><br />
But "the synthetic estrogen used in birth control pills can wreak havoc on the sex lives of fish," LeChevallier said, citing reduced penis size in male fish, masculinized female fish and other sex-related changes.<br /><br />
Because the synthetic estrogen is not absorbed well into the body, much of the drug is released into the environment through women's urine, he said. In addition, used contraceptive rings and patches are having a further polluting effect, he said.<br /><br />
Noting that in Europe, drug manufacturers are required to provide a bag for disposal or return of used contraceptive devices, LeChevallier recommended that the U.S. adopt the same policy. "Why do pharmaceutical companies here get a free ride?" he asked.<br /><br />
He said touting the environmental benefits of natural family planning "can be a new way to evangelize youths" and attract them to the church-approved method of postponing pregnancy.<br /><br />
Ruppersberger explained the various forms of natural family planning in use today and said, "If you want to stop the abortion mentality, you have to stop contraception."<br /><br />
He said birth control pills are sometimes prescribed for women with excessive menstrual cramping or bleeding, endometriosis and even acne.<br /><br />
"I have not had any problem in my practice without writing a prescription for birth control," he added. "People don't die from acne, but they do die from complications of birth control."<br /><br />
Ruppersberger said the new tools available to help couples practice natural family planning include the OV watch, which is worn while sleeping and notifies women four days before ovulation; Persona, a handheld fertility device currently available only in Europe; and OvaCue, a fertility monitor that detects electrolytes in a woman's saliva to predict ovulation.<br /><br />
He also said the Internet is increasingly being used to teach natural family planning. "If the evil one can use the Internet for pornography, we can use it to teach NFP and respect for life," he said.<br /><br />
Ruppersberger outlined some of the medical effects of contraceptives on the human body -- cancers, infections, cardiovascular complications, effects on the liver and the death of the woman, not to mention the death of an unborn child in an abortion when contraceptives fail.<br /><br />
The use of contraceptives also has been shown to result in increased depression in the women who take them, decreased self-esteem, increased divorce rates and increased teen promiscuity and pregnancy rates, he said.<br /><br />
Barillas' presentation focused on the "distinctly Catholic approach to environmental concerns," which she said is neither "a new message for us" nor "an issue that is out there just for people who live close to the woods."<br /><br />
Of special concern for Catholics is the fact that "the poor and powerless are most likely to bear the burden of our environmental carelessness," she said.<br /><br />
"The poor, the elderly and persons with disabilities often are exposed to multiple contaminants," Barillas said, adding that children especially are at risk because they suffer "greater exposure pound for pound" and have a "diminished ability to detoxify and excrete many chemical toxins."<br /><br />
Unborn children also face many environmental risks, including lead, mercury, pesticides and other chemicals, she said.<br /><br />
Many of those concerns are being addressed by the Catholic Coalition for Children and a Safe Environment and other organizations, she said</strong></span></span><p>&#160;</p><hr />

When this happens, an egg is not released and conception cannot occur. (It's important to read on and find out about the high rates of breakthrough ovulation. When ovulation is not suppressed, pregnancy can occur.)</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
2) The Pill also works to thicken the woman's cervical mucus which can "restrict" sperm from moving up the reproductive tract toward the egg.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
3) One way the Pill causes early abortions is that it interfers with the flexing motions and the cilia movement of the fallopian tubes. These changes slow the transportation of newly conceived child from the fallopian tubes to the womb. Unfortunately, many small babies starve to death in the fallopian tubes because chemicals caused changes that prevented them from reaching the womb in time to be nourished.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">4) Another way the Pill causes early abortions: If your tiny baby survives the ride down the fallopian tube to your womb, the Pill will almost always cause the endometrium (the lining of your uterus) to reject your child. Chemical reactions often cause the lining of your womb to become thin, shriveled and unable to support implantation of your newly conceived child.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">This means that in almost every case, your new child will not be able to attach to the wall of your womb where he or she would normally live, grow and receive nourishment for 9 months. This means your tiny baby will starve to death and his or her remains will be passed along in your next bleeding cycle. (The "Study of Abortion Deaths Commission" estimates that this happens in women in America who use the Pill approximately 1 to 4 million times each year.)</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The chemicals that cause these early abortions are called abortifacients which is the medical term for any chemical agent that causes an abortion.</span></strong></span></p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;<strong><font size="4" color="#993300">For a comprehensive list of resources on the abortifacient effect of birth control</font></strong></p><p align="center"><a class="external free" title="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><font color="#2861b5">http://www.epm.org/articles/larimore_list.html</font></span></strong></a></p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center; "><img width="137" height="103" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/Depo-provera.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: center; "><img width="140" height="78" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/3795483148.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: center; "><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /><strong>Depo-Provera, Norplant and IUDs</strong></span></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Depo-Provera and Norplant both use chemicals that work in very simlar ways on a woman's body and womb.

Some IUDs contain copper or a time released hormone. It is believed that the IUD causes a low grade inflammation in the lining of the womb. As a result, the lining of the womb is imperfect and the fertilized egg will not implant. (Source: This paragraph on IUDs is quoted directly from the Calgary Regional Health Authority's web site.)</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of the chemical effect an IUD has on a woman's womb, tiny babies are aborted.

Please feel free to print a copy of this article to bring with you when you go to meet with your pastor. Ask him if he understands the destructive and sinful nature of the Pill and other forms of artificial contraception. And please remember, if you are a Catholic, the Catholic Church offers God's mercy and forgiveness in a beautiful way through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession). If you've committed a serious sin, you should go to confession right away. Priests are very understanding and they are there to help you. Confession is a great place to begin the process of forgiveness and healing.

Natural Family Planning (NFP) is a healthy alternative to artificial birth control. With NFP, there are no drugs, no devices, no surgical procedures, no threat of death, no side effects and no chemical abortions. NFP is not the old Rhythm Method that was developed in the 1930's. NFP has been thoroughly tested and is proven to be highly effective. NFP is only recommended for married couples who have some burden (financial, emotional, health or other) causing them to need to space or limit the size of their family. It is suggested that you speak with your pastor or a spiritual director for spiritual guidance in this area.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Reports show NFP to be about 99% effective in determining when a woman is at the stage where she will conceive. This can help with trying to get pregnant as well as trying to avoid pregnancy.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>"Using NFP has been a blessing!

Deirdre McQuade, pro-life spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, reacted strongly to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcement on July 31 moving toward over-the- counter (OTC) availability of Plan B for women eighteen and older.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>"Making this powerful, abortifacient drug available without a doctor's oversight could place women and their newly-conceived children at risk," Ms. McQuade said.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Plan B -- also known as the "morning-after pill" -- is essentially a megadose of prescription hormonal birth-control pills. "Plan B is marketed as a contraceptive but even its proponents admit that it works both before and after conception," Ms. McQuade said.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>"Over-the-counter availability would allow these drugs to be used routinely, despite the fact that they are not approved for such use.

"Many are also unaware of their abortifacient action."</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>"Women for whom the drug is dangerous would not have the benefit of any clinical advice to alert them to the risks," McQuade said.

Priests for Life Announces Year-Long Preparation for 40th Anniversary of Humanae Vitae</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>July 25, 2008 will be the 40th anniversary of Pope Paul VI’s encyclical letter Humanae Vitae. Beginning on July 25 of 2007, Priests for Life will call attention to this special anniversary, and to the wisdom and insight of this important document. Respect for human life is the basis of civilization, and respect for life demands respect for the sources of life. We invite you to visit this page frequently during the year for updates and practical resources.</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>There is a close link between abortion and contraception. Natural Family Planning, furthermore, provides a solution to both. The Encyclical Humanae Vitae has been and will remain a prophetic voice in the Church bearing witness to these truths. Pope John Paul II's Evangelium Vitae likewise explains the connection between abortion and contraception as "fruits of the same tree."</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>In their 2001 revision of the Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities ("A Campaign in Support of Life"), the United States Catholic Bishops speak of the connection between abortion and contraception in the following paragraphs:</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a class="new" title="Abortion and Contraception" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion_and_Contraception&amp;action=edit"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Abortion and Contraception</span></span></a></span></span></p><span style="font-size: medium;"><p>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>The Church's teaching and pastoral efforts on responsible parenthood are appropriately treated more fully in other documents. However, we address the issue here, because some promote widespread use of contraception as a means to reduce abortions and even criticize the Church for not accepting this approach.</strong></span></p></span><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>It is noteworthy that as acceptance and use of contraception have increased in our society, so have acceptance and use of abortion. Couples who unintentionally conceive a child while using contraception are far more likely to resort to abortion than others. Tragically, our society has fallen into a mentality that views children as a burden and invites many to consider abortion as a "backup" to contraceptive failure. This is most obvious in efforts to promote as "emergency contraception" drugs that really act as early abortifacients.</strong></span></span></p><p><br /><img width="200" height="292" alt="" src="/Portals/0/priest_pope_pics/200px-John_Paul_II_and_Benedict_XVI.jpg" /></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><br />
With Pope John Paul II we affirm that contraception and abortion are "specifically different evils," because only "the latter destroys the life of a human being," but that they are also related (The Gospel of Life, no. 13). It is important to remember that means that are referred to as "contraceptive" are, in reality, sometimes also abortifacient.

In the Christian tradition, birth control had long been associated with promiscuity and adultery, and resolutely condemned. However, after the Anglican Church passed a resolution in favor of birth control at its 1930 Lambeth Conference, other Protestant denominations began to relax their prohibitions as well. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church held fast to its opposition.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Vatican's stand against contraception was centuries old. For much of that time, however, birth control had remained a dormant issue. Since most birth control consisted of folk remedies and homemade cervical caps, there was little cause for the Church to respond. It was the mass production and availability of rubber condoms and diaphragms in the 1920s and 1930s, made possible by the 1839 invention of vulcanized rubber, which eventually forced the Church to take a public position on specific contraceptives.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A Mortal Sin</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On New Year's Eve 1930, the Roman Catholic Church officially banned any "artificial" means of birth control. Condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps were defined as artificial, since they blocked the natural journey of sperm during intercourse. Douches, suppositories and spermicides all killed or impeded sperm, and were banned as well. According to Church doctrine, tampering with the "male seed" was tantamount to murder. A common admonition on the subject at the time was "so many conceptions prevented, so many homicides." To interfere with God's will was a mortal sin and grounds for excommunication.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Purpose of Intercourse</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">For the Vatican, the primary purpose of intercourse was for the sacred act of procreation. If couples were interested in having intercourse, then they had to be willing to accept the potential for the creation of another life. For devout Catholics, that left only abstinence or the church-approved rhythm method (the practice of abstaining from sex during the woman's period of ovulation). However, the rhythm method was unreliable, and many believed it placed a heavy strain on marital relations.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A Reformist Climate</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">With the arrival of the birth control pill in 1960, many believed the Church was about to change the position it had held for centuries. The Church was in the midst of reform, and in this climate of modernization it seemed possible that the Vatican might bend on birth control. Since 1957, Church law had allowed women with "irregular" cycles to take the Pill to regularize their cycle and enable them to better practice the rhythm method. Approval of the contraceptive pill, many believed, was soon to follow.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"Natural" Contraception</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Pro-Pill Catholics had a powerful ally on their side. John Rock, the eminent Catholic physician who had carried out Pill trials with Dr. Gregory Pincus, publicly argued that the Pill was merely an extension of the body's normal functioning. Since the Pill used the same hormones already present in the female reproductive system and did not tamper with sperm, Rock believed the Church should view the Pill as a "natural" form of contraception.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Vatican convened a commission to study the question of the Pill, but the Church would take eight years to determine its policy towards the Pill. In the interim, the Pill quickly became the most popular method of birth control among American women -- regardless of religion.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><img width="102" height="125" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/2571511172.jpg" /></p><p><table align="center" width="98%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="0"><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p align="center">&#160;</p><p align="center"><span class="author"><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/en/user/725"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">Nancy Guilfoy Valko RN</font></a></span></p></td><td align="right" rowspan="2"><p align="center"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">&#160;</font></p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">&#160;</font></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p align="center"><span class="story_title"><font size="4" color="#ff3300">Adventures in Pill Land</font></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/68643"><strong><font color="#ff6600">http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/68643</font></strong></a><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><img width="141" height="140" alt="" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/images159951.jpg" /></p><p><font size="4" color="#327d9a">Q.</font> <strong>Does the birth control pill increase your risk of breast cancer?</strong><br /><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /><font style="font-size: 18px; color: #327d9a">A.</font> Since I am not a physician, in order to answer this question, I can only refer you to those who are:</span></span></strong></p><ul><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In a July 29th 2005 press release, the World Health Organization openly admitted that cobined estrogen-progestogen Oral Contraceptives are carcinogenic to humans. Specifically, they said that “Use of OC’s increases risk of breast, cervix, and liver cancer.” The data was presented by a working group of 21 scientists from 8 countries convened by the cancer research agency of the WHO, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The press release can be read </span></span></strong><strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.iarc.fr/ENG/Press_Releases/pr167a.html"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">.</span></span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em> (PDR) is a 3500 page book used by doctors that explains how drugs work. In it is the “exact copy of the product’s FDA-approved or other manufacturer-supplied labeling.” The 2006 PDR states that “a meta-analysis of 54 studies found a small increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives or had used them within the past ten years.” Upon reading this, I tracked down the original source. It was an article from the Lancet, which gathered data from over 150,000 women. It said, “The studies included in this collaboration represent about 90% of the epidemiological information on the topic, and what is known about the other studies suggests that their omission has not materially affected the main conclusions.” Some might argue that the increase in breast cancer risk is only a small one. But with 80-100 million women on the pill across the globe, the numbers certainly add up.</span></span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most recently, in October 2006, the journal of the Mayo Clinic (<em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em>) published an article entitled </span></span></strong><strong><a target="_new" href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf/8110/8110a1.pdf"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">“Oral Contraceptive Use as a Risk Factor for Pre-menopausal Breast Cancer: A Meta-analysis,”</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> authored by Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., et al. It revealed that 21 of 23 studies that followed women who took the pill prior to having their first child showed an increased risk of breast cancer. The increase was especially steep among younger women. Dr. Kahlenborn told WebMD, "Anyone who is prescribing oral contraceptives has a duty to tell women that 21 of 23 studies showed an increased risk." He added elsewhere that, “As more information comes out, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to suppress [the documented evidence from medical studies]. There’s a growing sense that it’s really just a matter of time before the lid blows on this thing. I think by the year 2010, we will start seeing a new attitude towards the pill, and it will be fueled by lawsuits.”</span></span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In the <em>Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs </em>it is stated that "Early-age use of the pill carries a greater risk of breast cancer, of developing larger tumors and having a worse prognosis"(2). The Pill can cause plenty of other problems as well, but click </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.pureloveclub.net/chastity/index.php?id=7&amp;entryid=124"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">here </span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">for details on that. <br /><br />Many doctors do not believe there is a link between the Pill and breast cancer. But considering that the World Heath Organization, the 2006 <em>Physician’s Desk Reference</em>, the journal of the Mayo Clinic, and other reliable sources openly admit such a connection, I believe there is reason for concern. Should a woman be prescribed the pill for medical reasons (as my wife was, with Endometriosis and ovarian tumors), she will be glad to know that successful alternatives exist.

Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., explains: "Two of the most important types of hormones that control reproduction are estrogens and progestins. Birth Control Pills are made from synthetic estrogens and/or progestins.

It is the union of an egg and sperm — an embryo.&#160; Such is God's way.&#160; He takes something smaller than a mustard seed and brings forth all of civilization. &#160;After creating everything in the universe single-handedly, He created us in his own image and bestowed upon us the power to become co-creators with Him. &#160;Working in union with us, when the sperm unites with the egg, not only has a new human life been set in motion, but so too has a spiritual life.&#160; God places an everlasting soul into the being of every son and daughter.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of us rarely think that deeply about it all. &#160;In our worldly way, we forget eternity and begin to affix costs — physical, emotional and monetary.&#160; The costs can seem exorbitant when we focus only through the eyes of the world. &#160;And looking through those same worldly eyes, the way to prevent the miracle we clearly do not recognize as such is so easy, inexpensive, and ironically, also so small — the birth control pill.&#160; But the pill does not just prevent the miracle, it also destroys it,&#160;a fact that is often surprising to committed pro-lifers.&#160; This fact is true for all contraception that works through manipulation of hormone levels.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">History</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The pill has become a symbol of freedom to those who have been told they can "have it all".&#160; And it has become a symbol of destruction to those who support a "Theology of the Body," philosophy, the essence of Catholic teaching that artificial means must not disrupt God's natural order of things.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The first birth control pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 1960.&#160; Using a synthetic estrogen hormone, the pill tricked a women's body into thinking it was pregnant.&#160; No egg would be released thereby preventing the opportunity for conception.&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the pill was initially introduced with the idea of affording women a reliable way of limiting their family size, it soon became the ticket to the Sexual Revolution that began in the Sixties and never really ended.&#160; The pill promised something it's never been able to deliver: sex with "no strings attached". &#160;There are always emotional and moral consequences to thwarting God's purpose, but women discovered physical problems too. &#160;Blood clots, heart attacks and strokes were some of the side effects caused by the Pill's high estrogen levels.&#160; Drug manufacturers lowered these levels in order to reduce the side effects but that also increased the incidence of breakthrough ovulation.&#160; With the lower levels of estrogen, eggs would sometimes still get released and pregnancies resulted.&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The drug companies tackled this situation by adding the synthetic hormone progesterone, which makes the uterine wall (the endometrium) inhospitable to implantation by an embryo. &#160;So if an egg was released and became fertilized by a sperm, thus creating life, the pill would have actually failed to prevent a conception, meaning it failed as a contraceptive.&#160; But, through preventing implantation of the embryo, the pill acts as an abortifacient and stops life from continuing to the next stage.&#160; (A clear and simple demonstration of this can be seen </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiCU46_lWeE"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">.)</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since some women actually do become pregnant while on the pill, there are some embryos that manage to implant into the uterus. &#160;Whether it's RU-486, Norplant, Depo-Provera, the morning after pill, the Mini-pill, or the Pill, there is no chemical "contraceptive" that&#160;<em>always </em>causes an abortion.&#160; There is also none that <em>never</em> causes an abortion<em>.</em></span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ignorance</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no way of knowing what percentage of pregnancies result in abortion through the pill.&#160; The woman using the pill with this scenario never even knows that she conceived a child.&#160; Her cycle will continue on schedule with no realization that an embryo is being flushed from her body.&#160; The Catholic Church has never wavered on the teaching that life begins at conception.&#160; Although Catholics are contracepting at rates parallel to non-Catholics, using artificial means to change our body's natural functions in order to block the potential for life has been recognized as rebellion against God's plan for humanity.&#160; However, using natural means to understand the rhythms of life and then to work in union with God is encouraged through Natural Family Planning.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The issue of birth control is a big one where misunderstanding and ignorance often misguide people.&#160; But when it comes to the pill, the ignorance that many women fall prey to is lack of understanding of its abortifacient properties.&#160; Most women don't consider that while taking their birth control, they may also be aborting a life within them.&#160; As Pope Paul VI predicted when he issued his encyclical <em>Humanae Vitae</em> (<em>Of Human Life</em>) in 1968, the use of artificial contraception would lead to abortions.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it seemed to many to be an overdramatic prediction, it proved to be prophetic.&#160; In hindsight, its logic in saying that widespread use of contraception would lead to "conjugal infidelity and the general lowering of morality"&#160;was prophetic. &#160;Since the Pill began to be sold in 1960, divorces have tripled, out-of-wedlock births jumped from 224,000 to 1.2 million, abortions doubled, and cohabitation soared 10-fold from 430,000 to 4.2 million.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sex both inside and outside marriage ceased to be about a bond of marital love in which a couple became one in union with God.&#160; It became merely an activity for personal satisfaction devoid of anything more.&#160; The Pope predicted man would lose respect for woman, considering her "as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment, and no longer as his respected and beloved companion."</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Society as a whole moved from recognizing sex as something reserved for married couples to something for everyone, since the possibility for pregnancy was greatly reduced (although never completely removed).&#160; Thus, people completely opposed to having children could have sex with others whom they had chosen as bed partners but would never chose to co-parent their children.&#160; The most intimate experience intended to be shared in love and self-giving with the potential for creating life became merely a form of recreation.&#160; And if life sprang forth, such a life was easily regarded as nothing more than an unintended problem that could legally be disposed of through abortion.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But women choosing abortion and the men who either make that choice with them or plead for them to do otherwise, are very aware of the decision that is being made, whereas women who choose to take birth control pills are not so aware of the potential ramifications of their choice.&#160; There is not a baby with a heartbeat who must forcefully be removed, but unbeknownst to many, there <em>is</em> a baby.&#160; Since life begins at conception, a life, even though undetectable to us, is still a life.&#160; It is the way God chooses to begin things, small and yet mighty in its eternal existence.&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition to the pill, IUDs, Depo-Provera and Norplant also cause early, undetectable abortions.&#160;&#160;Doctor usually fail to warn women of the abortifacient properties of the pill.&#160; I've heard some doctors admit they were not actually even aware of these properties.&#160;&#160;Women often choose contraception as a means to avoid pregnancy without realizing they are not actually stopping pregnancy, but quickly ending it.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Denial</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In his booklet, titled <em>Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?</em>, Randy Alcorn states: "The question of whether it causes abortions has direct bearing on untold millions of Christians, many of them pro-life, who use and recommend it. &#160;For those who believe God is the Creator of each person and the giver and taker of human life, this is a question with profound moral implications."</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Alcorn was a Protestant pastor who not only used the pill in his married life, but also counseled other married couples to do so.&#160; He had a vested interest in <em>not</em> recognizing the pill as an abortifactient.&#160; But when confronted with the facts through his own research, it demanded changes in his own behavior and philosophy.&#160; His </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.epm.org/articles/bcp5400.html#_edn31"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">booklet</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> was written in 1998 to inform others of the truth.</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Alcorn's booklet has met some opposition.&#160; According to him: "Despite evidence, some pro-life physicians state that the likelihood of the Pill having an abortifacient effect is infinitesimally low, or nonexistent. </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.epm.org/articles/bcp5400.html#_edn31"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Though I would very much like to believe this, the scientific evidence does not permit me to do so."</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Alcorn, surprisingly, found that the greatest resistance to recognizing the abortifacient quality of the pill comes from the Christian community.&#160; "Dr. Walt Larimore has told me that whenever he has presented this evidence to audiences of secular physicians, there has been little or no resistance to it.&#160; But when he has presented it to Christian physicians there has been substantial resistance. &#160;Since secular physicians do not care whether the Pill prevents implantation, they tend to be objective in interpreting the evidence. &#160;After all, they have little or nothing at stake either way.&#160; Christian physicians, however, very much do not want to believe the Pill causes early abortions. &#160;Therefore, I believe, they tend to resist the evidence. &#160;This is certainly understandable. &#160;Nonetheless, we should not permit what we<em> want </em>to believe to distract us from what the evidence indicates we <em>should</em> believe."&#160;&#160;</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It's easier to be pro-life when we limit the discussion to the abortion industry.&#160; The inclusion of artificial birth control complicates and confuses people.&#160; With so many opinions even among Catholics, how is a person to know what to believe?&#160; I understand the confusion.&#160; While living in Montana, I had a doctor who was also a priest, who told me it was not realistic to expect a couple to follow the Catholic teaching on birth control.&#160; He prescribed birth control pills to many of his female patients.&#160; So, is it any surprise there are many Catholics, ones like me, ignorant of the true teaching?</span></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Yet, we must cut through the false teachings and erroneous opinions to reach the truth.&#160; Our lives, our bodies and our souls are all we have.&#160; They are gifts that must be safeguarded. </span></span></strong><strong><a href="http://www.christopherwest.com/"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Christopher West</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">, author and speaker,&#160;has written books and articles explaining the beauty and truth of God's plan for men and women. &#160;In his book, <em>Good News about Sex and Marriage</em>, he asserts that the Church's teaching on sex and marriage is good news because it's the truth about love and true love is the fulfillment of the human person. &#160;He also admits that the news is challenging.&#160;

CHERRY HILL, N.J. (CNS) -- Mark W. LeChevallier agrees with Dr. Lester Ruppersberger, a pro-life obstetrician and gynecologist, that natural family planning is safe, healthy and effective. But he would add one more characteristic: It's environmentally responsible.<br /><br />
LeChevallier is director of innovation and environmental stewardship at American Water, the largest water and wastewater provider in North America. Along with his wife, he also has been a certified instructor of natural family planning for the past 25 years.<br /><br />
In separate talks July 26 to a national conference in Cherry Hill, LeChevallier and Ruppersberger approached the topic of natural family planning from very different directions but reached similarly positive conclusions.<br /><br />
The July 25-27 conference brought together leaders from diocesan pro-life, family life and social justice offices around the country.<br /><br />
Ruppersberger's talk on "Scientific Advances in Fertility Management" touted the benefits he has seen for his patients and himself since he switched to an NFP-only medical practice in 1999.<br /><br />
LeChevallier shared the podium with Roxana U. Barillas, a domestic policy adviser at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, for a discussion on "Toxins, the Environment and the Child in the Womb." He spoke about the drastic effects that discarded contraceptive medicines and devices have been having on the nation's water and animals, especially fish.<br /><br />
In a talk with the daunting title of "Endocrine Disruptions: Chemical Contraceptives in Sewage Effluents," LeChevallier explained that like secondhand smoke, "secondhand estrogens are being released into the environment," to devastating effect on fish, panthers, alligators and other wildlife.<br /><br />
He said the media "did a little bit of a disservice" to the American public when they reported earlier this year that the levels of contaminants found in drinking water could seriously harm humans.<br /><br />
For example, "you would have to drink 100 million gallons to get the dose found in one Tylenol," he said.<br /><br />
But "the synthetic estrogen used in birth control pills can wreak havoc on the sex lives of fish," LeChevallier said, citing reduced penis size in male fish, masculinized female fish and other sex-related changes.<br /><br />
Because the synthetic estrogen is not absorbed well into the body, much of the drug is released into the environment through women's urine, he said. In addition, used contraceptive rings and patches are having a further polluting effect, he said.<br /><br />
Noting that in Europe, drug manufacturers are required to provide a bag for disposal or return of used contraceptive devices, LeChevallier recommended that the U.S. adopt the same policy. "Why do pharmaceutical companies here get a free ride?" he asked.<br /><br />
He said touting the environmental benefits of natural family planning "can be a new way to evangelize youths" and attract them to the church-approved method of postponing pregnancy.<br /><br />
Ruppersberger explained the various forms of natural family planning in use today and said, "If you want to stop the abortion mentality, you have to stop contraception."<br /><br />
He said birth control pills are sometimes prescribed for women with excessive menstrual cramping or bleeding, endometriosis and even acne.<br /><br />
"I have not had any problem in my practice without writing a prescription for birth control," he added. "People don't die from acne, but they do die from complications of birth control."<br /><br />
Ruppersberger said the new tools available to help couples practice natural family planning include the OV watch, which is worn while sleeping and notifies women four days before ovulation; Persona, a handheld fertility device currently available only in Europe; and OvaCue, a fertility monitor that detects electrolytes in a woman's saliva to predict ovulation.<br /><br />
He also said the Internet is increasingly being used to teach natural family planning. "If the evil one can use the Internet for pornography, we can use it to teach NFP and respect for life," he said.<br /><br />
Ruppersberger outlined some of the medical effects of contraceptives on the human body -- cancers, infections, cardiovascular complications, effects on the liver and the death of the woman, not to mention the death of an unborn child in an abortion when contraceptives fail.<br /><br />
The use of contraceptives also has been shown to result in increased depression in the women who take them, decreased self-esteem, increased divorce rates and increased teen promiscuity and pregnancy rates, he said.<br /><br />
Barillas' presentation focused on the "distinctly Catholic approach to environmental concerns," which she said is neither "a new message for us" nor "an issue that is out there just for people who live close to the woods."<br /><br />
Of special concern for Catholics is the fact that "the poor and powerless are most likely to bear the burden of our environmental carelessness," she said.<br /><br />
"The poor, the elderly and persons with disabilities often are exposed to multiple contaminants," Barillas said, adding that children especially are at risk because they suffer "greater exposure pound for pound" and have a "diminished ability to detoxify and excrete many chemical toxins."<br /><br />
