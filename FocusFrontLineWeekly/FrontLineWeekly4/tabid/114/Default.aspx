David Bereit talking to our Prayer volunteers.</div><font size="4"><strong>October 31 - All Hollow's Eve:<br /></strong>Mary and Martha had another interesting event happen yesterday at the site.&#160; A young woman went into the clinic and her friend, Joseph, came over to talk to Mary and Martha.&#160; His friend (we don't know if it was wife or girlfriend) was 3 months pregnant and wanted to abort the baby but Joseph didn't want to.&#160; Joseph tried to get back into the abortion mill to talk to the mother but they wouldn't let him in (Side note:&#160; This is standard procedure at abortion mills since they don't want anyone else to influence the 'choice' once the mother is inside.)&#160; About 30 minutes later (not enough time for an abortion) she came out and Joseph seemed to be smiling.&#160; They didn't stop to talk to Mary or Martha so we are not completely sure if it is a save but we ask for prayers for Joseph, her friend and their baby.<br /><br /><strong>October 30:</strong><br />
You might be thinking that nothing must be happening this week because I haven't blogged for a few days.&#160; Well, it turns out that I've been out sick and trying to keep up with many things at the same time. I feel bad because I haven't been able to get out to the vigil as often as I have before but the Holy Spirit has made sure that we have a good presence at the vigil.<br /><br />
I hear that there was a big group of young people last night around 5PM even though it was very cold.&#160; It turns out that it was the St. Leo's Youth Group who came out together to the vigil.&#160; <br /><br />
We've also had more new people coming to the vigil and signing up for the first time with the campaign!&#160; Only three more days to go!!!&#160; Don't miss the opportunity to come out and pray for an end to abortion.&#160; There's actually some open time tomorrow night since it is Halloween and many people are probably thinking of other activities instead of coming out to the vigil.&#160; We would like to have presence until 7PM at least.<br /><br />
Don't forget to send me an email if you are planning to come to the Victory Celebration.&#160; I'm really looking forward to meeting many of you for the first time even though we have been praying together for 40 days!<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 26:<br /></strong>Sundays continue to be an interesting day!&#160; I keep hearing how someone signed up for an afternoon hour where the schedule showed it was empty but when they get to the site, there are 10 other people praying!&#160; This is awesome!!!&#160; I really want to thank everyone who has come out to the vigil at any time during this 33 days!<br /><br />
This also means we have seven days left.&#160; Please, help us finish strong by keeping an eye on the schedule (click on Vigil Schedule above), and helping to fill any hours that are empty.&#160; Who knows, maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones to find a group there to join you!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">October 24:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Today was an eventful day!&#160; Around noon, we had a young lady who came out from Planned Parenthood (she was getting a Depo shot) with a 5 month old baby sleeping in her arms.&#160; She stopped to talk to us and we offered her some baby clothes and other things.&#160; She was very appreciative and very receptive to the information.&#160; Please, pray for her and for Baby Larry.<br /><br />
Later, Mary and Pat found themselves driving down Main Street looking for a group of three girls who had gone in to Planned Parenthood and were supposed to stop by the Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; Long story short, Mary and Pat found them at a Bus stop and provided them with information.&#160; One of them was pregnant but she wasn't 'abortion minded'.&#160; <br /><br />
Later today, a young man stopped by to ask for directions.&#160; He's from Memphis, TN, and has been here in Rochester for two months.&#160; He asked us what we were doing and we explained to him about Planned Parenthood, abortion, and the campaign.&#160; He seemed to be very interested and related how he didn't agree with abortion either.&#160; Mary and me gave him some information and invited him to come back and&#160; pray with us.<br /><br />
I really believe that God is using the vigil volunteers to touch many people's hearts and to bring them closer to Him.&#160; Praise be to God!!!<br /><br />

I mentioned before that since the weather is getting colder (and wetter) to make sure you are prepared if you are heading to the vigil site.&#160; At the same time, I want to ask everyone else, wherever you are, to keep in your prayers those who are at the vigil site.&#160; It is hard enough to give witness to life at the sidewalk, it is even harder when you are all wet and cold!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">October 22:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Most of you are probably familiar with the packets of information that we are giving out at the vigil site (some of us called them "Truth Packets").&#160; They are loaded with a lot of information about abortion, contraceptives, Planned Parenthood, STDs, Fetal development, contact information for help, etc.&#160; Some of the people with a lot of experience praying and doing sidewalk counseling at abortion facilities have mentioned to me several times of how open to the truth people seem to be at the sidewalk.&#160; We are actually giving away a lot of these Truth Packets!&#160; I think that for most of the day today, we didn't have any at the site because we ran out yesterday.&#160; We need to reprint more of the material that is used on these packets.&#160; If you want to help, please follow the Donate link above to make a donation to help cover the costs of these materials.&#160; Thanks!<br />

Last Saturday morning, October 11, while the Lambs of Christ were praying on the sidewalk, a total of 4 young women went from Planned Parenthood over to the Focus Pregnancy Center.&#160; I don't know whether any of them was abortion minded, but the first one was pregnant, due in April.&#160; The other three were together and one of them said she already had a child.&#160; Pro-lifer Michelle went over to the pregnancy center and spent quite a while counseling these young women.&#160; The interesting part was that the Planned Parenthood escort had taken away a packet of information from one of these young women that we had given to her.&#160; The Planned Parenthood security guard actually tried to get the packet back after she threw it in the garbage but the Planned Parenthood escort retrieved it first and wouldn't allow him to give it back to us.&#160; But the grace of God was working and the woman ended up coming over to the pregnancy center.<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">October 13 - Half-way through our Campaign!!!<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Here we are on day 20 of our 40 Days for Life!!!&#160; It has been amazing to see the support, the people who have come out to the vigil, having two babies officially saved (and who knows how many more!), many people who are open to the Life message, and many more who need healing who have asked for information.&#160; This is God's work!!!&#160; And every single person who has been involved with our campaign, even if for just one prayer, has had an impact on the whole campaign!<br /><br />
I know I'm behind in blogging but I wanted to recognized the two groups from "America Needs Fatima" who came out on Saturday to pray at the vigil.&#160; I was there with the 8am group and there were about 30 people, including the children, who came out to pray together.&#160; The second group was at noon and had a good turn-out too.&#160; <br /><br /><font color="#ff0000">DON'T MISS THIS:&#160; Tomorrow, Tuesday October 14th, the national 40 Days for Life team will have a nationwide Tele-conference.&#160; It is open to everyone who wants to participate.&#160; To find out more, visit:&#160; http://www.40daysforlife.com/midpoint</font><br /><br />
By the way, if you are reading this blog, send me an email to Roc40DFL@rochester.rr.com to let me know what kind of information you would like to see on this page (That will also let me know that someone is actually reading this!!!).&#160; <br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 9:<br /></strong>Today was a sad day with more abortions taking place.&#160; Kathy found herself talking to a 16 year old who just had an abortion.&#160; Her car stopped next to the vigil and Kathy had the opportunity to minister to her.&#160; She seemed to be regretting what she did.&#160; Kathy gave her information for the Rachel program.&#160; Please, pray for her and her family that they may find healing and forgiveness in God's infinite mercy.<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 7:<br /></strong>We witnessed another change of heart and another baby was saved!!!&#160; Martha reported that around 11:15am a lady came out from the facility and she smiled at Martha.&#160; Martha offered her some information and the lady responded by saying:&#160; "I didn't do it!&#160; I didn't do it!".&#160; She had gone in with the intention of having an abortion but after seeing the prayer volunteers at the sidewalk she knew she couldn't do it.&#160; She knew they were praying for her.&#160; Thanks be to God!!!<br /><br />
On the other side, the prayer volunteers witnessed when a lady was taken by ambulance, probably because of complications from an abortion.&#160; Please keep her and all the other ladies who did actually go through with it today.<br /><br />
Put in your calendars the midpoint event on Saturday, October 18th - will start with Mass at Our Lady of Victory Church, 200 Pleasant St in Rochester, at 12:10pm and then assemble at 1:00pm to do a procession from Our Lady of Victory towards Planned Parenthood at University Ave.&#160; More details to come!!!<br /><br />
Don't forget to look at the Schedule.&#160; Please, help us with Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of this week.<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 5:<br /></strong>We were blessed in so many ways today!!!&#160; It was a beautiful day and very quiet too.&#160; Then, around 3:30 we started to assemble and put things together for our guest(s).&#160; David Bereit and Ellen Stanford arrived around 4:30pm.&#160; We were all inspired by David's words and encouraged by the stories from other 40 Days For Life cities.&#160; It was very uplifting to find out (before it came out on his email on Monday) that so far, 89 babies have been saved!!!&#160; And this are only the ones that we know about.&#160; Thanks to all who came to welcome David and Ellen!&#160; Keep up the prayers, fasting, and don't forget to join us at the vigil site!<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 4:<br /></strong>It is amazing how time passes by!!!&#160; The prayer volunteers keep reporting how people seem to be very receptive to our message and many are showing their support for our presence at the vigil.&#160; <br /><br />
Today Mary talked to a young (teenagers) couple with a 6 month old baby who had friends who had had abortions and others who were considering it.&#160; Mary provided them with lots of information for them to share and help protect life.<br /><br />
DON'T FORGET - Sunday, October 5th, David Bereit and Johnette S. Benkovic will&#160; be at the vigil site (114 University Ave.) around 5:00pm.&#160; Come join us for a powerful hour of prayer!!!<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 1:<br /></strong>We continue to have reports of people stopping and asking for information (of course, we also have the ones who don't approve of what we are doing).<br /><br />
This morning while I was welcoming the Clinic's employees with the "Pray to End Abortion" sign, one car stopped in the driveway as it was going in and the driver lowered the window.&#160; I was getting ready for the worst when I was greeted by the words "I pray for that every day", signaling to the sign.&#160; I was speechless and all I could say was Thank you and God Bless you!!!<br /><br />
I'm also seeing a little frustration in some of the employees when they see us there every morning.&#160; I hope they understand that we are there to show them God's love and to witness for life.<br /><br />
Please, help us keep this peaceful presence going for all 40 Days.&#160; Right now, the schedule for Sunday is looking very light.&#160; Don't forget, Johnette S. Benkovic and David Bereit are planning to be there on Sunday around 5:00pm.&#160; Those who start early will get the better 'seating'!&#160; :)<br /><br />
Thanks for the prayers!!!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 30:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">This is the end of the month of September and the end of our first week in our 40 day campaign.&#160; God is so generous in His love!!!<br /><br />
This Sunday at 2:00pm there will be a Life Chain at St. John the Evangelist in Ridge Road West, Greece - and Johnette Benkovic will be there.&#160; Around 5:00pm, David Bereit and Johnette Benkovic will be at our vigil site for an hour of prayer at Planned Parenthood, 114 University Ave.&#160; Join us for both events!<br /><br />
Please, look at the schedule for this weekend to help fill some hours during the vigil.&#160; Thanks to all for all the prayers and support!!!<br /></font><font size="4"><strong>September 28:<br /></strong>We have been able to have a vigil for at least 12 hours a day each day (Wednesday we did all 24 hours!!!).&#160; Thanks to all the prayer volunteers who have come out (especially today with the dreary weather) and spent some time in prayer in front of the Planned Parenthood.&#160; I won't mention names but there are some who have gone well beyond the call of duty by spending many hours at the vigil site.&#160; God bless you!!! <br />
And many stories are coming out from the vigil too.&#160; Mary had a young man stop and get some information after sharing that his girlfriend had had an abortion and a miscarriage.&#160; Please pray that he and his girlfriend find healing in God's love.&#160; Here's another story from yesterday from Mary:&#160; "2 young girls were walking up the street.&#160; They started to talk to Kathy &amp; I only to find out that the one girl needed a pregnancy test.&#160; We 3 walked into the center for a test and she was open to 'life' if she was pregnant.&#160; She wasn't.&#160; They walked back outside with me after I gave them some literature &amp; a Truth packet.&#160; I spoke with them about abstinence &amp; they were receptive.&#160; When we got out on the sidewalk they started holding up the signs &amp; wanted to come back another time to do it again.&#160; God bless these 2 sweet girls from God. <br /><br />
Just after they left another girl came over to us, she had just walked out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She took a Truth packet &amp; didn't believe in abortion, thank God.&#160; She said that her friend had had 3 abortions.&#160; How sad.&#160; Kathy spoke with her for awhile &amp; gave her some more info. which she was grateful for.&#160; It was a very busy hour and a half."<br /><br />
You never know how God is going to use you unless you give Him the chance to do it.&#160; Come out with us and pray!&#160; The Holy Spirit is at work and waiting for members of the Body of Christ to become the vehicles of His grace!<br /><br />
If you still have some concerns about doing some time at the vigil or if you have any questions, please email me at roc40dfl@rochester.rr.com or call me at my cellphone - 585-305-1224.&#160; <br /><br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 26:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Have you been to the vigil site?&#160; Have you spent an hour in prayer in front of Planned Parenthood?&#160; Chances are that if you have, you probably want to do it again.&#160; There's something about praying in at the site that affects you and makes you want to come back.&#160; If you haven't done it yet, talk to someone who has.&#160; Look at the schedule, see where you can take one hour and learn what it means to be a witness.&#160; Maybe is the fact that since we are uniting our prayers with hundreds of thousand across the nation, the Holy Spirit is actively working on each of us to bring God's Grace to end abortion.&#160; It is very humbling and very encouraging at the same time.<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 25:&#160; Give thanks to the Lord for He is good!!!<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Anne and Sue were quietly praying,&#160; After seeing several ladies going into PP, Sue felt it would be better to hold up the 40 Days for Life sign.&#160; A lady walked by and asked about the verse on the sign ("Before I formed you in the womb I knew you"&#160; Jeremiah 1:5).&#160; It turns out, this lady was on her way to PP to have an abortion!&#160; The lady felt that Anne and Sue were a sign to her not to have an abortion.&#160; She didn't go into PP and Sue drove her home!!!&#160; Praise be to God!!!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 24:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Thank you to all who came to the Kick-off!!!&#160; We had 5 people at the start of the vigil:&#160; Kathy, Francis, Fr. Joe, Dominic, and Jose.&#160; What a wonderful experience!!!&#160; I'm hoping to post some pictures from the kick-off and the start of the vigil.<br /><br />
Please, check the schedule and see where you can help with at least one hour of your time!!<br /></font><strong><br /><br /><font size="4">September 22:</font></strong><br /><br /><font size="4">Let the countdown begin!!!&#160; We have kick-off tomorrow and then the Vigil begins on Wednesday!!<br /><br />
Thank you to all who have registered for the Vigil.&#160; Let me know if you have any problems with the scheduling tool (there are some bugs with login in some times).<br /><br />
Spread the word about the Kick-off tomorrow!!&#160; See you there!! </font><p><font size="4">&#160;&#160;</font></p><div id="clearboth"><hr /><p><font size="3" color="#0000ff"><strong>Monday, November 3, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p><h3 align="left" class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://kimberlyburke-awesomegod.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-all-saints-day-with-40-days-for-life.html"><font color="#0000ff">My All Saints Day with 40 Days for Life!</font></a></h3><div class="post-header-line-1">&#160;</div><div class="post-body entry-content"><p align="left"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yQdWCvJGhtg/SQ-4MPgYzTI/AAAAAAAAApk/U1e_6-l2hNk/s1600-h/life.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yQdWCvJGhtg/SQ-4MPgYzTI/AAAAAAAAApk/U1e_6-l2hNk/s400/life.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264629009879715122" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 150px; display: block; height: 113px;" /></a></p></div><p align="center"><a href="http://kimberlyburke-awesomegod.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-all-saints-day-with-40-days-for-life.html"><strong><font color="#993300">http://kimberlyburke-awesomegod.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-all-saints-day-with-40-days-for-life.html</font></strong></a></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><font size="4">&#160;<font color="#0000ff"><strong>Wednesday, November 5, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></font></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="center"><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGkm_0omlJSQkARrlXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0bHY4bDgwBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA3NrMQR2dGlkA0NTMDFfMTEy/SIG=1kmusjdm6/EXP=1231746164/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253DPICTURES%252BOF%252Bpeople%252Bstanding%2526y%253DSearch%26w=225%26h=325%26imgurl=www.photospin.com%252Fcontent%252Fphotos%252Fpreview%252F0790049.jpg%26size=15.9kB%26name=0790049.jpg%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.photospin.com%252Fsearch%253Fpage%253Dsingle%2526id%253D11363%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.photospin.com%252Fsearch%253Fpage%253Dsingle%2526id%253D11363%26p=people%2bstanding%26type=jpeg%26no=3%26tt=152%252C809%26oid=a48df3e1189e7ff6%26tit=0790049.jpg%26sigr=11k7906jv%26sigi=11kkh0ij2%26sigb=12e4jj66i" target="_self"><img width="59" height="86" src="http://sk1.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/a48df3e1189e7ff6" alt="www.photospin.com/content/photos/preview/0790049.jpg" title="http://www.photospin.com/content/photos/preview/0790049.jpg" /></a></p><p align="center">&#160;</p><p><font size="4"><strong>The</strong> <strong>'40 Days For Life' is over until February of 2009 but there are people still involved in coming to this Death Camp to pray &amp; witness the murdering of innocent&#160;&amp; defenseless life in this building.&#160; Remember that abortion is a very lucrative business &amp; PP will do it's EVIL for as long as possible.&#160; If they didn't have the clients then they would be out of business, there's where us&#160;Pro Lifers come in.&#160; We want to get the Truth out to the community so the women &amp; girls will not have their babies killed at Planned Parenthood or anywhere else.&#160; That the Good Lord will touch their hearts &amp; give their babies a Birthday Day &amp; not a Death Day instead.&#160; When the clients stop coming in to use their Death Services then &amp; only then will Planned Parenthood close for good.&#160; There is where Pro Lifers come in.&#160; We will Pray &amp; Witness &amp; Speak Truth &amp; Hand out Information that will educate the girls to the Truth &amp; also Show them the Truth, by using the Graphic Signs, of what abortion really&#160;looks like.&#160; The clump of tissue, that Planned Parenthood tells them, looks like this, a&#160;baby that has been destroyed by the abortionist hands.&#160;</strong></font></p><p><strong><font size="4">We handed out many Truth packets tonight &amp; had 2 clients come in for baby clothes &amp; more education to better their lives.&#160; We talked to Omar who had his girlfriend at Planned Parenthood, who was pregnant with twins.&#160; He said that she was there because she was bleeding but he seemed naive.&#160; We only hope &amp; pray that she did not deceive him, for he said that she wanted to come here.&#160; He took a Truth packet &amp; was a sweet man, we pray that all went well for his children.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Some of the people, in the cars, are guilty&#160; &amp; we &#160;hope &amp; pray that they will Repent of their abortion involvement.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><hr />

When the child died after his seven days of penance, David rose, cleaned himself, and ate.</font></strong></div><br /><div><font size="4">&#160;</font></div><div><strong><font size="4">When asked about this, David said "While the child was living, I fasted and wept, thinking, `Perhaps the Lord will grant me the child's life.'

Thank God.&#160; I gave her a bag of baby clothes for her son &amp; a book &amp; a stuffed animal.&#160; She was very happy.&#160; I asked her if she knew Jesus &amp; she said that it was Jesus that told her not to have an abortion.&#160; I said "yes He would say that".&#160; I was very happy that she listened to Him.&#160; She said that her mother was against abortion but that it was her body.&#160; I said "why would any woman do that to her body &amp; that the baby had a separate body which should be respected &amp; protected".&#160; She agreed.&#160; I told her about the Pill &amp; gave her information in regards to the abortion proprieties of the Pill, for she said that she was on the Pill but had sex when she had forgotten to take&#160;her pills for a couple of days.&#160;

She fell to the floor &amp; unfortunately hit her head on the open door leading to the meeting room.&#160; Her eyes rolled back &amp; she was as white as a ghost.&#160; I called 911 &amp; they sent an ambulance &amp; took her to the hospital.&#160; It was so upsetting to all of us.&#160; After a little while of discussing the situation we continued with the orientation.&#160; They had to go &amp; I went to the sidewalk to sidewalk counsel with the other pro lifers.&#160; We tried to talk to the girls telling them the Truth &amp; hand out literature packets.&#160; Usually the reactions are negative which is a heart break.&#160; </font></strong></p><font size="4"><hr /></font></div></div><p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><p align="center"><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGkjKBo2lJSLcAYjhXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0bHY4bDgwBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA3NrMQR2dGlkA0NTMDFfMTEy/SIG=1nptjdnov/EXP=1231746305/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253DPICTURES%252BOF%252Bbaby%252Btwins%2526y%253DSearch%26w=500%26h=375%26imgurl=static.flickr.com%252F2385%252F2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg%26size=98kB%26name=2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fbtlespirit%252F2151326307%252F%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fbtlespirit%252F2151326307%252F%26p=baby%2btwins%26type=jpeg%26no=3%26tt=126%252C315%26oid=60da0ce9ab0509de%26fusr=btlespirit%26hurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fbtlespirit%252F%26tit=Not%2bidentical%2btwins%26sigr=11jnj55ph%26sigi=11g6hflhg%26sigb=12910s9lj%26sigh=11820plos" target="_self"><font size="4"><img width="115" height="86" src="http://sk1.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/60da0ce9ab0509de" alt="static.flickr.com/2385/2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg" title="http://static.flickr.com/2385/2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg" /></font></a></p></div></div></div></div><p><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Saturday, December 27, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The 'Lambs of Christ' were praying the Rosary in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160;

continued while we got in the center.&#160; I gave her2 DVD's one on a bloodless abortion procedure &amp; the other was a 3D Ultrasound.&#160; I gave her more information &amp; showed her graphic pictures of aborted babies to give her the realization of what she had planned to do to her son or daughter.&#160; She told me that she had a 1 year old daughter at home.&#160; I pleaded with her that she couldn't deprive her daughter of a new brother or sister.&#160; I also told her what God's Commandment says "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160; I said an Hail Mary &amp; Our Father out loud.&#160; I gave her a stuffed animal for her daughter &amp; a one-see for her child in the womb.&#160; I said that you cold give your baby up for adoption just give your baby LIFE.&#160; She said thank you &amp; left to get the bus.&#160; My heart &amp; prayers are with you &amp; your precious baby, Mom.&#160; P.S.&#160; I did ask for her name &amp; phone # and called her to speak with her some more.&#160; She told me that PP told her to put a pill up her vagina.&#160; I told her to flush it down the toilet &amp; to go to a good doctor that we have in the Truth packet for pre natal care &amp; that she could call me anytime for more help.&#160; And after the baby is born to come back to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center to get some clothes for her baby.&#160; Please Lord Jesus &amp; Mother Mary, protect this little 8 week old baby in the womb, who has been threatened by abortion not to die that way but to live.&#160; Please mom just let me be born!!&#160; I know that she was listening.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><p align="center"><strong><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5w2D3hJhCwBSEFXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0cG4wMGlzBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA0Y5NDVfMTE0/SIG=1j9fvrngr/EXP=1232691382/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253Dpictures%252Bof%252Bups%252Btruck%2526y%253DSearch%26w=260%26h=154%26imgurl=users.mikrotec.com%252F%257Ejodell%252Fimages%252FUPS%252520truck.JPG%26size=6.4kB%26name=UPS%2btruck.JPG%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fusers.mikrotec.com%252F%257Ejodell%252Fimages%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fusers.mikrotec.com%252F%257Ejodell%252Fimages%26p=ups%2btruck%26type=jpeg%26no=1%26tt=16%252C947%26oid=c99e1cd8cbef02d0%26tit=UPS%2btruck.JPG%26sigr=118usbrjc%26sigi=11h1i2tl0%26sigb=1283hbhv0" target="_self"><font size="4"><img width="130" height="77" src="http://ac4.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/c99e1cd8cbef02d0" alt="users.mikrotec.com/~jodell/images/UPS%20truck.JPG" title="http://users.mikrotec.com/~jodell/images/UPS%20truck.JPG" /></font></a></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">When I got back to the sidewalk I saw coming down the street the UPS truck &amp;

Baird - the Supreme Court Decision that legalized birth control for unmarried people as well as married people&#160;which was Sponsored by Rochester NOW. Co-sponsored by the First Unitarian Church and Planned Parenthood of the Rochester and Syracuse Region.&#160; Ther was 8 dedicated pro life prayer warriors praying for the 'End to Baby Killing',&#160;which the pro abortion side does NOT understand.&#160;&#160;&#160;I was statimg to the people coming in to to this' Death Lecture' to REPENT.&#160; It was hard enough to see the young people &amp; the middle age people but it was so sad to see the old people.&#160; I saw a middle age woman bring with her an older lady who was about 80+, how to comprehend this takes time.&#160; All of a sudden there were people coming down the walk way, it was the 'Death Squad'.&#160; I just continues to face the people driving down S. Winton &amp; then all of a sudden there was an unknown man standing before me.&#160; I said "who are you"?&#160; He replied " I'm Bill Barid".&#160; I then said to him "stop killing children, stop killing children, stop killing children"&#160; He then said "you sound like a robert, you need an lobectomy".&#160; I then made the sign of the cross &amp; said the St. Michael Prayer, &amp; then he left me after I gave him the Truth packet that I had offered to him &amp; he&#160;accepted to my dismay, that's God's grace.&#160; The woman who came with him said to me "we have Barick Obama' I said that "we have God".&#160; She just doesn't get it.&#160; How sad.&#160; In the meantime the other pro lifer was engaging with the woman who was with the 'Death Entrouge".&#160; She was saying that Birth Conrol was great &amp; that the pro lifer needed an Vastomectoy, isn't that sexist??&#160; Then they left towards the so-called church to start their lies to the Public, whose ears he will tickle.&#160; Then we continued the Rosary &amp; to witness to the public dirving down the street with prayer &amp; our graphic signs to which Bill Baird had to witness.&#160; During prayer I felt the Holy Spirit convicting me that I had brought 2 DVD's with me.&#160; One was a bloodless abortion procedure &amp; the other was a 4D Ultrasound.&#160; I had asked if some one whould go in the building with me &amp; the pro lifer that I have known for a long time said that he would.&#160; The other pro lifers were not sure if this was a good idea but when&#160;I am&#160;convicted by the Holy Spirit I try, with His grace, to do what He wants me to do no matter how difficult it is.&#160; As we entered the building I was greeted by a woman who was by the door to the autotorium.&#160; I simply said to her that I was pro life &amp; repeated it again to her for I feel she didn't understand.&#160; Then I was approached by a familiar 'Pro Death" woman who I have encountered in the past&#160;at Anti Life events.&#160; I smiled to her &amp; I saw that she was giving the proifer some literature &amp; I asked her for the same which she gave to me.&#160; I was looking for the pro lifer who I knew had come into the room to give her the DVD's so she could give them to Bill Baird at the end of his talk.&#160; I heard Bill barid say when I entered te room a Anti Catholic comment to which you would descern that he was Anti Catholic.&#160; I couldn't see my friend in the sparce room, not a good turn out, thank God.&#160; I then walked up to wher he was talking ,on a stage, &amp; said to him that I had to go but I wanted him to have these DVD's.&#160; I left them on the table to where he was talking.&#160; I then turned around to face the people, to leave, &amp; as I was walking down the asile I said to them "don't listen to him, don't listen to him".&#160; I passed some familiar pro deathe faces on the way back up the asile.&#160; Some in the audiance started to respond to my comment &amp; I heard Bill Barid say to the poor people "that's okay".&#160; Really Bill!!&#160;&#160; On the way out I again told the 'Death People' to REPENT for their soul sake.&#160; It is always diffult to be in the ememy's camp but with God's grace you can do anything.&#160;

She looked surprised &amp; asked if I had another packet.&#160; I said that I did have one in my car &amp; I ran to retrieve it for I had no more in the plastic container that we put the literature packets in, I ran out.&#160; Need to make more later.&#160; I then invited them into the Focus Pregnancy Help Center to&#160;get some baby clothes &amp; more information.&#160; They came into the center &amp; got blessed &amp;&#160;I got&#160;blessed too.&#160; The one young lady said that she has 2 children 6 &amp; 2 years old.&#160; She said the she got pregnant at 16 &amp; her mother, who gave birth to 8 children, drove her for an abortion.&#160; She said that she didn't want to do it &amp; her mother said that there was no abortions ever in her family but she brought to Planned Parenthood.&#160; Thank God that her Mother had a change of heart &amp; let her daughter continue her pregnancy.&#160; She told me that&#160;she is blessed with her son&#160;&amp; couldn't imagine life without him or her daughter.&#160; She also said that her mother was very sorry&#160;for taking her to get an abortion &amp; that when she sees her grandchild her heart still hurts thinking that she almost had him killed.&#160; It sounded that her mother has repented for her sin.&#160; She said that her family member just had a baby boy 8 lbs. &amp;&#160;the mom is&#160;experiencing&#160;&#160; post natal depression &amp; doesn't have much of anything for her baby also.&#160; Well, that got changed tonight.&#160; She was delighted to be blessed with many baby clothes &amp; items &amp; books &amp; stuffed animals for the baby.&#160; I told her to call the Woman's Care Center for bigger baby items like a crib &amp; a&#160;car seat.&#160; She said that she had talked her out of having an abortion.&#160; I said that she was a 'Life Saver" &amp; she did a great job in saving his life.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; Then she said that her cousin was thinking of having an abortion which would be her second for she had one about a year ago, &#160;My heart sank. I gave her 2 DVDs. One was the bloodless abortion procedure &amp; the other was the 3D Ultrasound video.&#160; She said that she would show her the 2 videos.&#160; I gave her loads of literature &amp; a plastic baby model of a 10 week old fetus.&#160; I know that she will try very hard to save this baby too.&#160; I know that this baby will be saved from being aborted.&#160;She was very grateful &amp; said that she will tell everybody about the center.&#160;She said that the center is hard to see from the street &amp; I agreed.&#160; I wish that we were more visible to the people walking by &amp; the cars driving by.&#160; Maybe someday we will be more visible.&#160; The other young girl that was with this sweet girl was so nice too.&#160; She said that when she got pregnant she never thought of an abortion.&#160; I said "that's great, when a woman or girl gets pregnant she should have no decision to make you just keep the baby in the womb to grow &amp; to be born", that's it.&#160; She agreed.&#160; She has a 2 year old daughter at home &amp; was&#160;given some real nice things for her daughter.&#160; We were all blessed this evening.&#160; I said a prayer for them &amp;

I just got on the sidewalk to counsel &amp; I called out to two black girls that just had come out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; They stopped at the driveway &amp; I offered them the Truth packet.&#160; The passenger responded that they were not their for an abortion &amp; that they kept their kids.&#160; I asked them if they needed any baby clothes &amp; that there was a pregnancy center right next to the yellow building.&#160; I then said to them to follow me.&#160; We got to the center &amp; I offered them clothes for their children.&#160; Each sister had&#160;one child each they told me, one was a girl &amp; the other was a boy,&#160;both 1 years old. &#160;One of the girls&#160;had her baby boy with her, he was as cute as a button.&#160; They were impressed with the selection &amp; then said to me that I should just say to the girls at Planned Parenthood that we have baby clothes &amp; not to show those horrible pictures of aborted babies to them.&#160;&#160;I said to them that the pictures have saved a lot of babies from being killed by abortion.&#160; Their backs were turned to me, as they were picking out baby clothes, &amp; then I asked the question "I hope that you girls never had an abortion" to which the first girl mumbled that she had&#160;4 abortions &amp; her sister said that she had 2 abortions.&#160; I almost dropped to the floor &amp; really wanted to stay there forever.&#160; Then they said "what did you expect us to do?.&#160; I said "adoption" to which they both turned around, at the same time,&#160;to face me with their eyes wide open &amp; together&#160;they said "are you crazy!".&#160; I thought I was in a Twilight Zone episode &amp; couldn't&#160; process what I just heard.&#160; I then said "no, it was crazy to have your babies killed".&#160; The one sister said that she didn't want to feel labor pain &amp; the other sister said that she couldn't afford the babies.&#160; I replied that there is no excuse, under Heaven, that makes it okay to have a baby killed by abortion.&#160; Earlier, when they first came into the center we were talking about abortion &amp; the one sister said "that people just don't care".&#160; Then come to find out that she was one of them.&#160; I said to the girls that you need to ask the Lord to forgive you.&#160; The one sister said that she was a Christian &amp; I replied that&#160;you didn't act as a Christian &amp;&#160;God says in the 10 Commandments "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160;&#160; I was worry because they were trying to justify these murders of 6 innocent children.&#160;&#160;&#160;The one sister said "I talked to God &amp; asked Him to forgive me&#160; &amp; if I had to do it over again I won't"&#160; Then the other sister said " I am sorry, I know now it was wrong".&#160; I only hope that they can take it further with the Lord &amp; His Forgiveness &amp; Mercy &amp; ask their children to forgive them too for taking their lives.&#160; I put in the clothes bag more information for them to read, now some info regarding Post Abortion healing organizations.&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.christianpoint.org/inspiration/images/crying_baby.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://rbgfenix.blogspot.com/2008/08/airports.html&amp;h=389&amp;w=586&amp;sz=35&amp;tbnid=c1VMuvm7He7auM::&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=135&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dpictures%2Bof%2Bblack%2Bbaby%2Bcrying&amp;hl=en&amp;usg=__bG-HgAr1HlVzPlV249gEebpeWzQ=&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=image&amp;cd=1"><font size="4"><img width="135" height="90" border="1" align="middle" src="http://www.google.com/images?q=tbn:c1VMuvm7He7auM::www.christianpoint.org/inspiration/images/crying_baby.jpg" alt="http://rbgfenix.blogspot.com/2008/08/airports.html" title="http://rbgfenix.blogspot.com/2008/08/airports.html" /></font></a></strong></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;I looked at this little baby&#160;eyes, that she was carrying &amp;

picked her up.&#160; When they left the drive way she smiled at me &amp; I said that I was worried about her &amp; they drove away.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she had changed her mind &amp; decided not to have her baby killed.&#160;

When he got out of the car he came right over to David &amp; I.&#160; He said to us that he was there for the morning after pill because he wasn't ready to have a baby.&#160; I said that you were ready to have sex &amp; that'&#160;how babies are made.&#160; I said to him that the Morning after Pill can take a life of the baby.&#160; That if fertilization had occurred that the fertilized egg cannot plant in the womb &amp; the baby is sluffed off.&#160; That's taking a life.&#160; He said that the sperm was wasted by the condoms &amp; that the eggs were wasted by having a period???&#160; Then he said that he was Biology major , go figure.&#160; I said that when the sperm penetrated the egg, which is conception, which Is a baby.&#160; I don't know where he goes to school but some there doesn't know much.&#160; Then he said that there were to many people in the world something about overpopulation???&#160; I said that there isn't enough people in the world for their being killed by abortion &amp; that some countries in Europe do not enough people.&#160; Then I offered him a Truth packet &amp; to my surprise he took it.&#160; Then he saw the poster of the picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe &amp; went bonkers.&#160; He said "I knew that you were faith based, I knew that you were faith based" &amp; walked away toward the floor of PP &amp; went in.&#160; About 10 minutes later he came out without the Truth packet &amp; went to his car.&#160; A few minutes later he went back into PP &amp; when he came back out again he was holding the Truth packet, hooray!!&#160; When he was at the entrance of the parking lot he stopped the car &amp; rolled down the windows &amp; hollered "why don't you leave these people alone you are upsetting them in there &amp; why don't you just go home, they're going to do what they want to do anyways, just go home.&#160; I said "no, I'm glad that they are upset that means that they are hearing the Truth &amp; some of them are in there about to have their babies killed, we offer them the Truth about what they are about to do".&#160; Then he said to me "why do you care again, why do you care"&#160; I hollered back to him that "I was almost aborted".&#160; He hollered back&#160; "I&#160;was almost aborted too.&#160; I said to him in a stressed voice, "then why are you not with us if you were almost killed by abortion"?&#160; You must have an idea the fear that these poor babies feel &amp; you could have been killed but&#160;was spared.&#160; Then he asked him what education have I had.&#160; I didn't answer &amp; he asked again.&#160; David said that he is a student at the Eastman School of Music.&#160;He asked me again the same question&#160;&amp; then said "did you even graduate from High School"!&#160; It seemed that there was a war between him &amp; I.&#160; I then said that I was a nurse.&#160;&#160; I&#160;have not practiced nursing for a long time really ever since&#160;I was a nurse at Highland Hospital back in the late 70's that's when Morris Wortman (before he became an abortionist) at that time he was a resident had hurt my back. &#160;One day as I was walking down the hall, he was coming&#160;up the hall &amp; he grabbed my right arm &amp; swung me in the opposite direction.&#160; I felt like I was flying in the air.&#160; I ended up in the opposite direction of the hall.&#160; When I landed I knew that my back had been hurt.&#160; I&#160;told him so &amp;&#160;all he said to me was "no I didn't" but he did hurt my back.&#160; To this day I have a permanent partial nerve root compression at L5.&#160; Which means that I have a numb right leg &amp; also am in consistent pain &amp; discomfort.&#160; I offer it up to the Lord&#160;for his conversion &amp; that he would stop murdering little babies.&#160; Then the angry young man put himself back in the drivers seat &amp; drove away.&#160; Later on after David had left around 2 PM the police came.&#160; He said that someone had called &amp; said that I was harassing here.&#160; I told the good officer that I was not but only giving the people the information that they had not received before.&#160; That people get mad when they hear the Truth sometimes.&#160; I then said to him that I had Freedom of Speech that I was not threatening them but offering them help.&#160; He said that he had to come over because he got the call.&#160; I said that was fine officer for I've been out here for 13 years now (really even longer) &amp; that I know some of the officers like officers Mike &amp; Chris.&#160; He said fine &amp; then left.&#160; Poor kid, I know that he called the police &amp;&#160;later on I know that he will realize what went on today.&#160; For I hope &amp; pray "that today was the first day of his life".&#160; Only to start after he called the police.&#160; He was so confused by all the lies &amp; deception in his life until today.&#160; Usually you reject the Truth before you embrace it.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu6sOd49J1ykBJ5dXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBzYzBlYzNtBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA00wMDJfODY-/SIG=1lbivoo7h/EXP=1234225294/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253Dpictures%252Bof%252Ba%252Bmean%252Blady%2526y%253DSearch%26w=800%26h=600%26imgurl=www.beware-of-art.com%252Fimages%252Fjournal%252F2005%252F10%252Fmean-lady.jpg%26size=49.3kB%26name=mean-lady.jpg%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.beware-of-art.com%252Fimages%252Fjournal%252F2005%252F10%253FN%253DA%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.beware-of-art.com%252Fimages%252Fjournal%252F2005%252F10%253FN%253DA%26p=mean%2blady%26type=jpeg%26no=2%26tt=13%252C980%26oid=846890fd5caf0e3c%26tit=mean-lady.jpg%26sigr=11n0cls19%26sigi=11qufal2n%26sigb=12abhscn7" target="_self"><font size="4"><img width="115" height="86" src="http://ac4.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/846890fd5caf0e3c" alt="www.beware-of-art.com/images/journal/2005/10/mean-lady.jpg" title="http://www.beware-of-art.com/images/journal/2005/10/mean-lady.jpg" /></font></a></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A woman was driving her daughter into Planned Parenthood for an abortion I really felt it especially when I said what would the Lord tell you to do &amp;

David Bereit talking to our Prayer volunteers.</div><font size="4"><strong>October 31 - All Hollow's Eve:<br /></strong>Mary and Martha had another interesting event happen yesterday at the site.&#160; A young woman went into the clinic and her friend, Joseph, came over to talk to Mary and Martha.&#160; His friend (we don't know if it was wife or girlfriend) was 3 months pregnant and wanted to abort the baby but Joseph didn't want to.&#160; Joseph tried to get back into the abortion mill to talk to the mother but they wouldn't let him in (Side note:&#160; This is standard procedure at abortion mills since they don't want anyone else to influence the 'choice' once the mother is inside.)&#160; About 30 minutes later (not enough time for an abortion) she came out and Joseph seemed to be smiling.&#160; They didn't stop to talk to Mary or Martha so we are not completely sure if it is a save but we ask for prayers for Joseph, her friend and their baby.<br /><br /><strong>October 30:</strong><br />
You might be thinking that nothing must be happening this week because I haven't blogged for a few days.&#160; Well, it turns out that I've been out sick and trying to keep up with many things at the same time. I feel bad because I haven't been able to get out to the vigil as often as I have before but the Holy Spirit has made sure that we have a good presence at the vigil.<br /><br />
I hear that there was a big group of young people last night around 5PM even though it was very cold.&#160; It turns out that it was the St. Leo's Youth Group who came out together to the vigil.&#160; <br /><br />
We've also had more new people coming to the vigil and signing up for the first time with the campaign!&#160; Only three more days to go!!!&#160; Don't miss the opportunity to come out and pray for an end to abortion.&#160; There's actually some open time tomorrow night since it is Halloween and many people are probably thinking of other activities instead of coming out to the vigil.&#160; We would like to have presence until 7PM at least.<br /><br />
Don't forget to send me an email if you are planning to come to the Victory Celebration.&#160; I'm really looking forward to meeting many of you for the first time even though we have been praying together for 40 days!<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 26:<br /></strong>Sundays continue to be an interesting day!&#160; I keep hearing how someone signed up for an afternoon hour where the schedule showed it was empty but when they get to the site, there are 10 other people praying!&#160; This is awesome!!!&#160; I really want to thank everyone who has come out to the vigil at any time during this 33 days!<br /><br />
This also means we have seven days left.&#160; Please, help us finish strong by keeping an eye on the schedule (click on Vigil Schedule above), and helping to fill any hours that are empty.&#160; Who knows, maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones to find a group there to join you!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">October 24:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Today was an eventful day!&#160; Around noon, we had a young lady who came out from Planned Parenthood (she was getting a Depo shot) with a 5 month old baby sleeping in her arms.&#160; She stopped to talk to us and we offered her some baby clothes and other things.&#160; She was very appreciative and very receptive to the information.&#160; Please, pray for her and for Baby Larry.<br /><br />
Later, Mary and Pat found themselves driving down Main Street looking for a group of three girls who had gone in to Planned Parenthood and were supposed to stop by the Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; Long story short, Mary and Pat found them at a Bus stop and provided them with information.&#160; One of them was pregnant but she wasn't 'abortion minded'.&#160; <br /><br />
Later today, a young man stopped by to ask for directions.&#160; He's from Memphis, TN, and has been here in Rochester for two months.&#160; He asked us what we were doing and we explained to him about Planned Parenthood, abortion, and the campaign.&#160; He seemed to be very interested and related how he didn't agree with abortion either.&#160; Mary and me gave him some information and invited him to come back and&#160; pray with us.<br /><br />
I really believe that God is using the vigil volunteers to touch many people's hearts and to bring them closer to Him.&#160; Praise be to God!!!<br /><br />

I mentioned before that since the weather is getting colder (and wetter) to make sure you are prepared if you are heading to the vigil site.&#160; At the same time, I want to ask everyone else, wherever you are, to keep in your prayers those who are at the vigil site.&#160; It is hard enough to give witness to life at the sidewalk, it is even harder when you are all wet and cold!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">October 22:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Most of you are probably familiar with the packets of information that we are giving out at the vigil site (some of us called them "Truth Packets").&#160; They are loaded with a lot of information about abortion, contraceptives, Planned Parenthood, STDs, Fetal development, contact information for help, etc.&#160; Some of the people with a lot of experience praying and doing sidewalk counseling at abortion facilities have mentioned to me several times of how open to the truth people seem to be at the sidewalk.&#160; We are actually giving away a lot of these Truth Packets!&#160; I think that for most of the day today, we didn't have any at the site because we ran out yesterday.&#160; We need to reprint more of the material that is used on these packets.&#160; If you want to help, please follow the Donate link above to make a donation to help cover the costs of these materials.&#160; Thanks!<br />

Last Saturday morning, October 11, while the Lambs of Christ were praying on the sidewalk, a total of 4 young women went from Planned Parenthood over to the Focus Pregnancy Center.&#160; I don't know whether any of them was abortion minded, but the first one was pregnant, due in April.&#160; The other three were together and one of them said she already had a child.&#160; Pro-lifer Michelle went over to the pregnancy center and spent quite a while counseling these young women.&#160; The interesting part was that the Planned Parenthood escort had taken away a packet of information from one of these young women that we had given to her.&#160; The Planned Parenthood security guard actually tried to get the packet back after she threw it in the garbage but the Planned Parenthood escort retrieved it first and wouldn't allow him to give it back to us.&#160; But the grace of God was working and the woman ended up coming over to the pregnancy center.<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">October 13 - Half-way through our Campaign!!!<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Here we are on day 20 of our 40 Days for Life!!!&#160; It has been amazing to see the support, the people who have come out to the vigil, having two babies officially saved (and who knows how many more!), many people who are open to the Life message, and many more who need healing who have asked for information.&#160; This is God's work!!!&#160; And every single person who has been involved with our campaign, even if for just one prayer, has had an impact on the whole campaign!<br /><br />
I know I'm behind in blogging but I wanted to recognized the two groups from "America Needs Fatima" who came out on Saturday to pray at the vigil.&#160; I was there with the 8am group and there were about 30 people, including the children, who came out to pray together.&#160; The second group was at noon and had a good turn-out too.&#160; <br /><br /><font color="#ff0000">DON'T MISS THIS:&#160; Tomorrow, Tuesday October 14th, the national 40 Days for Life team will have a nationwide Tele-conference.&#160; It is open to everyone who wants to participate.&#160; To find out more, visit:&#160; http://www.40daysforlife.com/midpoint</font><br /><br />
By the way, if you are reading this blog, send me an email to Roc40DFL@rochester.rr.com to let me know what kind of information you would like to see on this page (That will also let me know that someone is actually reading this!!!).&#160; <br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 9:<br /></strong>Today was a sad day with more abortions taking place.&#160; Kathy found herself talking to a 16 year old who just had an abortion.&#160; Her car stopped next to the vigil and Kathy had the opportunity to minister to her.&#160; She seemed to be regretting what she did.&#160; Kathy gave her information for the Rachel program.&#160; Please, pray for her and her family that they may find healing and forgiveness in God's infinite mercy.<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 7:<br /></strong>We witnessed another change of heart and another baby was saved!!!&#160; Martha reported that around 11:15am a lady came out from the facility and she smiled at Martha.&#160; Martha offered her some information and the lady responded by saying:&#160; "I didn't do it!&#160; I didn't do it!".&#160; She had gone in with the intention of having an abortion but after seeing the prayer volunteers at the sidewalk she knew she couldn't do it.&#160; She knew they were praying for her.&#160; Thanks be to God!!!<br /><br />
On the other side, the prayer volunteers witnessed when a lady was taken by ambulance, probably because of complications from an abortion.&#160; Please keep her and all the other ladies who did actually go through with it today.<br /><br />
Put in your calendars the midpoint event on Saturday, October 18th - will start with Mass at Our Lady of Victory Church, 200 Pleasant St in Rochester, at 12:10pm and then assemble at 1:00pm to do a procession from Our Lady of Victory towards Planned Parenthood at University Ave.&#160; More details to come!!!<br /><br />
Don't forget to look at the Schedule.&#160; Please, help us with Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of this week.<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 5:<br /></strong>We were blessed in so many ways today!!!&#160; It was a beautiful day and very quiet too.&#160; Then, around 3:30 we started to assemble and put things together for our guest(s).&#160; David Bereit and Ellen Stanford arrived around 4:30pm.&#160; We were all inspired by David's words and encouraged by the stories from other 40 Days For Life cities.&#160; It was very uplifting to find out (before it came out on his email on Monday) that so far, 89 babies have been saved!!!&#160; And this are only the ones that we know about.&#160; Thanks to all who came to welcome David and Ellen!&#160; Keep up the prayers, fasting, and don't forget to join us at the vigil site!<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 4:<br /></strong>It is amazing how time passes by!!!&#160; The prayer volunteers keep reporting how people seem to be very receptive to our message and many are showing their support for our presence at the vigil.&#160; <br /><br />
Today Mary talked to a young (teenagers) couple with a 6 month old baby who had friends who had had abortions and others who were considering it.&#160; Mary provided them with lots of information for them to share and help protect life.<br /><br />
DON'T FORGET - Sunday, October 5th, David Bereit and Johnette S. Benkovic will&#160; be at the vigil site (114 University Ave.) around 5:00pm.&#160; Come join us for a powerful hour of prayer!!!<br /><br /></font><font size="4"><strong>October 1:<br /></strong>We continue to have reports of people stopping and asking for information (of course, we also have the ones who don't approve of what we are doing).<br /><br />
This morning while I was welcoming the Clinic's employees with the "Pray to End Abortion" sign, one car stopped in the driveway as it was going in and the driver lowered the window.&#160; I was getting ready for the worst when I was greeted by the words "I pray for that every day", signaling to the sign.&#160; I was speechless and all I could say was Thank you and God Bless you!!!<br /><br />
I'm also seeing a little frustration in some of the employees when they see us there every morning.&#160; I hope they understand that we are there to show them God's love and to witness for life.<br /><br />
Please, help us keep this peaceful presence going for all 40 Days.&#160; Right now, the schedule for Sunday is looking very light.&#160; Don't forget, Johnette S. Benkovic and David Bereit are planning to be there on Sunday around 5:00pm.&#160; Those who start early will get the better 'seating'!&#160; :)<br /><br />
Thanks for the prayers!!!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 30:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">This is the end of the month of September and the end of our first week in our 40 day campaign.&#160; God is so generous in His love!!!<br /><br />
This Sunday at 2:00pm there will be a Life Chain at St. John the Evangelist in Ridge Road West, Greece - and Johnette Benkovic will be there.&#160; Around 5:00pm, David Bereit and Johnette Benkovic will be at our vigil site for an hour of prayer at Planned Parenthood, 114 University Ave.&#160; Join us for both events!<br /><br />
Please, look at the schedule for this weekend to help fill some hours during the vigil.&#160; Thanks to all for all the prayers and support!!!<br /></font><font size="4"><strong>September 28:<br /></strong>We have been able to have a vigil for at least 12 hours a day each day (Wednesday we did all 24 hours!!!).&#160; Thanks to all the prayer volunteers who have come out (especially today with the dreary weather) and spent some time in prayer in front of the Planned Parenthood.&#160; I won't mention names but there are some who have gone well beyond the call of duty by spending many hours at the vigil site.&#160; God bless you!!! <br />
And many stories are coming out from the vigil too.&#160; Mary had a young man stop and get some information after sharing that his girlfriend had had an abortion and a miscarriage.&#160; Please pray that he and his girlfriend find healing in God's love.&#160; Here's another story from yesterday from Mary:&#160; "2 young girls were walking up the street.&#160; They started to talk to Kathy &amp; I only to find out that the one girl needed a pregnancy test.&#160; We 3 walked into the center for a test and she was open to 'life' if she was pregnant.&#160; She wasn't.&#160; They walked back outside with me after I gave them some literature &amp; a Truth packet.&#160; I spoke with them about abstinence &amp; they were receptive.&#160; When we got out on the sidewalk they started holding up the signs &amp; wanted to come back another time to do it again.&#160; God bless these 2 sweet girls from God. <br /><br />
Just after they left another girl came over to us, she had just walked out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She took a Truth packet &amp; didn't believe in abortion, thank God.&#160; She said that her friend had had 3 abortions.&#160; How sad.&#160; Kathy spoke with her for awhile &amp; gave her some more info. which she was grateful for.&#160; It was a very busy hour and a half."<br /><br />
You never know how God is going to use you unless you give Him the chance to do it.&#160; Come out with us and pray!&#160; The Holy Spirit is at work and waiting for members of the Body of Christ to become the vehicles of His grace!<br /><br />
If you still have some concerns about doing some time at the vigil or if you have any questions, please email me at roc40dfl@rochester.rr.com or call me at my cellphone - 585-305-1224.&#160; <br /><br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 26:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Have you been to the vigil site?&#160; Have you spent an hour in prayer in front of Planned Parenthood?&#160; Chances are that if you have, you probably want to do it again.&#160; There's something about praying in at the site that affects you and makes you want to come back.&#160; If you haven't done it yet, talk to someone who has.&#160; Look at the schedule, see where you can take one hour and learn what it means to be a witness.&#160; Maybe is the fact that since we are uniting our prayers with hundreds of thousand across the nation, the Holy Spirit is actively working on each of us to bring God's Grace to end abortion.&#160; It is very humbling and very encouraging at the same time.<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 25:&#160; Give thanks to the Lord for He is good!!!<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Anne and Sue were quietly praying,&#160; After seeing several ladies going into PP, Sue felt it would be better to hold up the 40 Days for Life sign.&#160; A lady walked by and asked about the verse on the sign ("Before I formed you in the womb I knew you"&#160; Jeremiah 1:5).&#160; It turns out, this lady was on her way to PP to have an abortion!&#160; The lady felt that Anne and Sue were a sign to her not to have an abortion.&#160; She didn't go into PP and Sue drove her home!!!&#160; Praise be to God!!!<br /></font><strong><br /><font size="4">September 24:<br /></font></strong><font size="4">Thank you to all who came to the Kick-off!!!&#160; We had 5 people at the start of the vigil:&#160; Kathy, Francis, Fr. Joe, Dominic, and Jose.&#160; What a wonderful experience!!!&#160; I'm hoping to post some pictures from the kick-off and the start of the vigil.<br /><br />
Please, check the schedule and see where you can help with at least one hour of your time!!<br /></font><strong><br /><br /><font size="4">September 22:</font></strong><br /><br /><font size="4">Let the countdown begin!!!&#160; We have kick-off tomorrow and then the Vigil begins on Wednesday!!<br /><br />
Thank you to all who have registered for the Vigil.&#160; Let me know if you have any problems with the scheduling tool (there are some bugs with login in some times).<br /><br />
Spread the word about the Kick-off tomorrow!!&#160; See you there!! </font><p><font size="4">&#160;&#160;</font></p><div id="clearboth"><hr /><p><font size="3" color="#0000ff"><strong>Monday, November 3, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p><h3 align="left" class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://kimberlyburke-awesomegod.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-all-saints-day-with-40-days-for-life.html"><font color="#0000ff">My All Saints Day with 40 Days for Life!</font></a></h3><div class="post-header-line-1">&#160;</div><div class="post-body entry-content"><p align="left"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yQdWCvJGhtg/SQ-4MPgYzTI/AAAAAAAAApk/U1e_6-l2hNk/s1600-h/life.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yQdWCvJGhtg/SQ-4MPgYzTI/AAAAAAAAApk/U1e_6-l2hNk/s400/life.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264629009879715122" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 150px; display: block; height: 113px;" /></a></p></div><p align="center"><a href="http://kimberlyburke-awesomegod.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-all-saints-day-with-40-days-for-life.html"><strong><font color="#993300">http://kimberlyburke-awesomegod.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-all-saints-day-with-40-days-for-life.html</font></strong></a></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><font size="4">&#160;<font color="#0000ff"><strong>Wednesday, November 5, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></font></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="center"><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGkm_0omlJSQkARrlXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0bHY4bDgwBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA3NrMQR2dGlkA0NTMDFfMTEy/SIG=1kmusjdm6/EXP=1231746164/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253DPICTURES%252BOF%252Bpeople%252Bstanding%2526y%253DSearch%26w=225%26h=325%26imgurl=www.photospin.com%252Fcontent%252Fphotos%252Fpreview%252F0790049.jpg%26size=15.9kB%26name=0790049.jpg%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.photospin.com%252Fsearch%253Fpage%253Dsingle%2526id%253D11363%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.photospin.com%252Fsearch%253Fpage%253Dsingle%2526id%253D11363%26p=people%2bstanding%26type=jpeg%26no=3%26tt=152%252C809%26oid=a48df3e1189e7ff6%26tit=0790049.jpg%26sigr=11k7906jv%26sigi=11kkh0ij2%26sigb=12e4jj66i" target="_self"><img width="59" height="86" src="http://sk1.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/a48df3e1189e7ff6" alt="www.photospin.com/content/photos/preview/0790049.jpg" title="http://www.photospin.com/content/photos/preview/0790049.jpg" /></a></p><p align="center">&#160;</p><p><font size="4"><strong>The</strong> <strong>'40 Days For Life' is over until February of 2009 but there are people still involved in coming to this Death Camp to pray &amp; witness the murdering of innocent&#160;&amp; defenseless life in this building.&#160; Remember that abortion is a very lucrative business &amp; PP will do it's EVIL for as long as possible.&#160; If they didn't have the clients then they would be out of business, there's where us&#160;Pro Lifers come in.&#160; We want to get the Truth out to the community so the women &amp; girls will not have their babies killed at Planned Parenthood or anywhere else.&#160; That the Good Lord will touch their hearts &amp; give their babies a Birthday Day &amp; not a Death Day instead.&#160; When the clients stop coming in to use their Death Services then &amp; only then will Planned Parenthood close for good.&#160; There is where Pro Lifers come in.&#160; We will Pray &amp; Witness &amp; Speak Truth &amp; Hand out Information that will educate the girls to the Truth &amp; also Show them the Truth, by using the Graphic Signs, of what abortion really&#160;looks like.&#160; The clump of tissue, that Planned Parenthood tells them, looks like this, a&#160;baby that has been destroyed by the abortionist hands.&#160;</strong></font></p><p><strong><font size="4">We handed out many Truth packets tonight &amp; had 2 clients come in for baby clothes &amp; more education to better their lives.&#160; We talked to Omar who had his girlfriend at Planned Parenthood, who was pregnant with twins.&#160; He said that she was there because she was bleeding but he seemed naive.&#160; We only hope &amp; pray that she did not deceive him, for he said that she wanted to come here.&#160; He took a Truth packet &amp; was a sweet man, we pray that all went well for his children.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Some of the people, in the cars, are guilty&#160; &amp; we &#160;hope &amp; pray that they will Repent of their abortion involvement.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><hr />

When the child died after his seven days of penance, David rose, cleaned himself, and ate.</font></strong></div><br /><div><font size="4">&#160;</font></div><div><strong><font size="4">When asked about this, David said "While the child was living, I fasted and wept, thinking, `Perhaps the Lord will grant me the child's life.'

Thank God.&#160; I gave her a bag of baby clothes for her son &amp; a book &amp; a stuffed animal.&#160; She was very happy.&#160; I asked her if she knew Jesus &amp; she said that it was Jesus that told her not to have an abortion.&#160; I said "yes He would say that".&#160; I was very happy that she listened to Him.&#160; She said that her mother was against abortion but that it was her body.&#160; I said "why would any woman do that to her body &amp; that the baby had a separate body which should be respected &amp; protected".&#160; She agreed.&#160; I told her about the Pill &amp; gave her information in regards to the abortion proprieties of the Pill, for she said that she was on the Pill but had sex when she had forgotten to take&#160;her pills for a couple of days.&#160;

She fell to the floor &amp; unfortunately hit her head on the open door leading to the meeting room.&#160; Her eyes rolled back &amp; she was as white as a ghost.&#160; I called 911 &amp; they sent an ambulance &amp; took her to the hospital.&#160; It was so upsetting to all of us.&#160; After a little while of discussing the situation we continued with the orientation.&#160; They had to go &amp; I went to the sidewalk to sidewalk counsel with the other pro lifers.&#160; We tried to talk to the girls telling them the Truth &amp; hand out literature packets.&#160; Usually the reactions are negative which is a heart break.&#160; </font></strong></p><font size="4"><hr /></font></div></div><p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><p align="center"><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGkjKBo2lJSLcAYjhXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0bHY4bDgwBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA3NrMQR2dGlkA0NTMDFfMTEy/SIG=1nptjdnov/EXP=1231746305/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253DPICTURES%252BOF%252Bbaby%252Btwins%2526y%253DSearch%26w=500%26h=375%26imgurl=static.flickr.com%252F2385%252F2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg%26size=98kB%26name=2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fbtlespirit%252F2151326307%252F%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fbtlespirit%252F2151326307%252F%26p=baby%2btwins%26type=jpeg%26no=3%26tt=126%252C315%26oid=60da0ce9ab0509de%26fusr=btlespirit%26hurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fbtlespirit%252F%26tit=Not%2bidentical%2btwins%26sigr=11jnj55ph%26sigi=11g6hflhg%26sigb=12910s9lj%26sigh=11820plos" target="_self"><font size="4"><img width="115" height="86" src="http://sk1.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/60da0ce9ab0509de" alt="static.flickr.com/2385/2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg" title="http://static.flickr.com/2385/2151326307_a064cc2506.jpg" /></font></a></p></div></div></div></div><p><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Saturday, December 27, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The 'Lambs of Christ' were praying the Rosary in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160;

continued while we got in the center.&#160; I gave her2 DVD's one on a bloodless abortion procedure &amp; the other was a 3D Ultrasound.&#160; I gave her more information &amp; showed her graphic pictures of aborted babies to give her the realization of what she had planned to do to her son or daughter.&#160; She told me that she had a 1 year old daughter at home.&#160; I pleaded with her that she couldn't deprive her daughter of a new brother or sister.&#160; I also told her what God's Commandment says "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160; I said an Hail Mary &amp; Our Father out loud.&#160; I gave her a stuffed animal for her daughter &amp; a one-see for her child in the womb.&#160; I said that you cold give your baby up for adoption just give your baby LIFE.&#160; She said thank you &amp; left to get the bus.&#160; My heart &amp; prayers are with you &amp; your precious baby, Mom.&#160; P.S.&#160; I did ask for her name &amp; phone # and called her to speak with her some more.&#160; She told me that PP told her to put a pill up her vagina.&#160; I told her to flush it down the toilet &amp; to go to a good doctor that we have in the Truth packet for pre natal care &amp; that she could call me anytime for more help.&#160; And after the baby is born to come back to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center to get some clothes for her baby.&#160; Please Lord Jesus &amp; Mother Mary, protect this little 8 week old baby in the womb, who has been threatened by abortion not to die that way but to live.&#160; Please mom just let me be born!!&#160; I know that she was listening.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><p align="center"><strong><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5w2D3hJhCwBSEFXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0cG4wMGlzBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA0Y5NDVfMTE0/SIG=1j9fvrngr/EXP=1232691382/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253Dpictures%252Bof%252Bups%252Btruck%2526y%253DSearch%26w=260%26h=154%26imgurl=users.mikrotec.com%252F%257Ejodell%252Fimages%252FUPS%252520truck.JPG%26size=6.4kB%26name=UPS%2btruck.JPG%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fusers.mikrotec.com%252F%257Ejodell%252Fimages%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fusers.mikrotec.com%252F%257Ejodell%252Fimages%26p=ups%2btruck%26type=jpeg%26no=1%26tt=16%252C947%26oid=c99e1cd8cbef02d0%26tit=UPS%2btruck.JPG%26sigr=118usbrjc%26sigi=11h1i2tl0%26sigb=1283hbhv0" target="_self"><font size="4"><img width="130" height="77" src="http://ac4.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/c99e1cd8cbef02d0" alt="users.mikrotec.com/~jodell/images/UPS%20truck.JPG" title="http://users.mikrotec.com/~jodell/images/UPS%20truck.JPG" /></font></a></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">When I got back to the sidewalk I saw coming down the street the UPS truck &amp;

Baird - the Supreme Court Decision that legalized birth control for unmarried people as well as married people&#160;which was Sponsored by Rochester NOW. Co-sponsored by the First Unitarian Church and Planned Parenthood of the Rochester and Syracuse Region.&#160; Ther was 8 dedicated pro life prayer warriors praying for the 'End to Baby Killing',&#160;which the pro abortion side does NOT understand.&#160;&#160;&#160;I was statimg to the people coming in to to this' Death Lecture' to REPENT.&#160; It was hard enough to see the young people &amp; the middle age people but it was so sad to see the old people.&#160; I saw a middle age woman bring with her an older lady who was about 80+, how to comprehend this takes time.&#160; All of a sudden there were people coming down the walk way, it was the 'Death Squad'.&#160; I just continues to face the people driving down S. Winton &amp; then all of a sudden there was an unknown man standing before me.&#160; I said "who are you"?&#160; He replied " I'm Bill Barid".&#160; I then said to him "stop killing children, stop killing children, stop killing children"&#160; He then said "you sound like a robert, you need an lobectomy".&#160; I then made the sign of the cross &amp; said the St. Michael Prayer, &amp; then he left me after I gave him the Truth packet that I had offered to him &amp; he&#160;accepted to my dismay, that's God's grace.&#160; The woman who came with him said to me "we have Barick Obama' I said that "we have God".&#160; She just doesn't get it.&#160; How sad.&#160; In the meantime the other pro lifer was engaging with the woman who was with the 'Death Entrouge".&#160; She was saying that Birth Conrol was great &amp; that the pro lifer needed an Vastomectoy, isn't that sexist??&#160; Then they left towards the so-called church to start their lies to the Public, whose ears he will tickle.&#160; Then we continued the Rosary &amp; to witness to the public dirving down the street with prayer &amp; our graphic signs to which Bill Baird had to witness.&#160; During prayer I felt the Holy Spirit convicting me that I had brought 2 DVD's with me.&#160; One was a bloodless abortion procedure &amp; the other was a 4D Ultrasound.&#160; I had asked if some one whould go in the building with me &amp; the pro lifer that I have known for a long time said that he would.&#160; The other pro lifers were not sure if this was a good idea but when&#160;I am&#160;convicted by the Holy Spirit I try, with His grace, to do what He wants me to do no matter how difficult it is.&#160; As we entered the building I was greeted by a woman who was by the door to the autotorium.&#160; I simply said to her that I was pro life &amp; repeated it again to her for I feel she didn't understand.&#160; Then I was approached by a familiar 'Pro Death" woman who I have encountered in the past&#160;at Anti Life events.&#160; I smiled to her &amp; I saw that she was giving the proifer some literature &amp; I asked her for the same which she gave to me.&#160; I was looking for the pro lifer who I knew had come into the room to give her the DVD's so she could give them to Bill Baird at the end of his talk.&#160; I heard Bill barid say when I entered te room a Anti Catholic comment to which you would descern that he was Anti Catholic.&#160; I couldn't see my friend in the sparce room, not a good turn out, thank God.&#160; I then walked up to wher he was talking ,on a stage, &amp; said to him that I had to go but I wanted him to have these DVD's.&#160; I left them on the table to where he was talking.&#160; I then turned around to face the people, to leave, &amp; as I was walking down the asile I said to them "don't listen to him, don't listen to him".&#160; I passed some familiar pro deathe faces on the way back up the asile.&#160; Some in the audiance started to respond to my comment &amp; I heard Bill Barid say to the poor people "that's okay".&#160; Really Bill!!&#160;&#160; On the way out I again told the 'Death People' to REPENT for their soul sake.&#160; It is always diffult to be in the ememy's camp but with God's grace you can do anything.&#160;

She looked surprised &amp; asked if I had another packet.&#160; I said that I did have one in my car &amp; I ran to retrieve it for I had no more in the plastic container that we put the literature packets in, I ran out.&#160; Need to make more later.&#160; I then invited them into the Focus Pregnancy Help Center to&#160;get some baby clothes &amp; more information.&#160; They came into the center &amp; got blessed &amp;&#160;I got&#160;blessed too.&#160; The one young lady said that she has 2 children 6 &amp; 2 years old.&#160; She said the she got pregnant at 16 &amp; her mother, who gave birth to 8 children, drove her for an abortion.&#160; She said that she didn't want to do it &amp; her mother said that there was no abortions ever in her family but she brought to Planned Parenthood.&#160; Thank God that her Mother had a change of heart &amp; let her daughter continue her pregnancy.&#160; She told me that&#160;she is blessed with her son&#160;&amp; couldn't imagine life without him or her daughter.&#160; She also said that her mother was very sorry&#160;for taking her to get an abortion &amp; that when she sees her grandchild her heart still hurts thinking that she almost had him killed.&#160; It sounded that her mother has repented for her sin.&#160; She said that her family member just had a baby boy 8 lbs. &amp;&#160;the mom is&#160;experiencing&#160;&#160; post natal depression &amp; doesn't have much of anything for her baby also.&#160; Well, that got changed tonight.&#160; She was delighted to be blessed with many baby clothes &amp; items &amp; books &amp; stuffed animals for the baby.&#160; I told her to call the Woman's Care Center for bigger baby items like a crib &amp; a&#160;car seat.&#160; She said that she had talked her out of having an abortion.&#160; I said that she was a 'Life Saver" &amp; she did a great job in saving his life.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; Then she said that her cousin was thinking of having an abortion which would be her second for she had one about a year ago, &#160;My heart sank. I gave her 2 DVDs. One was the bloodless abortion procedure &amp; the other was the 3D Ultrasound video.&#160; She said that she would show her the 2 videos.&#160; I gave her loads of literature &amp; a plastic baby model of a 10 week old fetus.&#160; I know that she will try very hard to save this baby too.&#160; I know that this baby will be saved from being aborted.&#160;She was very grateful &amp; said that she will tell everybody about the center.&#160;She said that the center is hard to see from the street &amp; I agreed.&#160; I wish that we were more visible to the people walking by &amp; the cars driving by.&#160; Maybe someday we will be more visible.&#160; The other young girl that was with this sweet girl was so nice too.&#160; She said that when she got pregnant she never thought of an abortion.&#160; I said "that's great, when a woman or girl gets pregnant she should have no decision to make you just keep the baby in the womb to grow &amp; to be born", that's it.&#160; She agreed.&#160; She has a 2 year old daughter at home &amp; was&#160;given some real nice things for her daughter.&#160; We were all blessed this evening.&#160; I said a prayer for them &amp;

I just got on the sidewalk to counsel &amp; I called out to two black girls that just had come out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; They stopped at the driveway &amp; I offered them the Truth packet.&#160; The passenger responded that they were not their for an abortion &amp; that they kept their kids.&#160; I asked them if they needed any baby clothes &amp; that there was a pregnancy center right next to the yellow building.&#160; I then said to them to follow me.&#160; We got to the center &amp; I offered them clothes for their children.&#160; Each sister had&#160;one child each they told me, one was a girl &amp; the other was a boy,&#160;both 1 years old. &#160;One of the girls&#160;had her baby boy with her, he was as cute as a button.&#160; They were impressed with the selection &amp; then said to me that I should just say to the girls at Planned Parenthood that we have baby clothes &amp; not to show those horrible pictures of aborted babies to them.&#160;&#160;I said to them that the pictures have saved a lot of babies from being killed by abortion.&#160; Their backs were turned to me, as they were picking out baby clothes, &amp; then I asked the question "I hope that you girls never had an abortion" to which the first girl mumbled that she had&#160;4 abortions &amp; her sister said that she had 2 abortions.&#160; I almost dropped to the floor &amp; really wanted to stay there forever.&#160; Then they said "what did you expect us to do?.&#160; I said "adoption" to which they both turned around, at the same time,&#160;to face me with their eyes wide open &amp; together&#160;they said "are you crazy!".&#160; I thought I was in a Twilight Zone episode &amp; couldn't&#160; process what I just heard.&#160; I then said "no, it was crazy to have your babies killed".&#160; The one sister said that she didn't want to feel labor pain &amp; the other sister said that she couldn't afford the babies.&#160; I replied that there is no excuse, under Heaven, that makes it okay to have a baby killed by abortion.&#160; Earlier, when they first came into the center we were talking about abortion &amp; the one sister said "that people just don't care".&#160; Then come to find out that she was one of them.&#160; I said to the girls that you need to ask the Lord to forgive you.&#160; The one sister said that she was a Christian &amp; I replied that&#160;you didn't act as a Christian &amp;&#160;God says in the 10 Commandments "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160;&#160; I was worry because they were trying to justify these murders of 6 innocent children.&#160;&#160;&#160;The one sister said "I talked to God &amp; asked Him to forgive me&#160; &amp; if I had to do it over again I won't"&#160; Then the other sister said " I am sorry, I know now it was wrong".&#160; I only hope that they can take it further with the Lord &amp; His Forgiveness &amp; Mercy &amp; ask their children to forgive them too for taking their lives.&#160; I put in the clothes bag more information for them to read, now some info regarding Post Abortion healing organizations.&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.christianpoint.org/inspiration/images/crying_baby.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://rbgfenix.blogspot.com/2008/08/airports.html&amp;h=389&amp;w=586&amp;sz=35&amp;tbnid=c1VMuvm7He7auM::&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=135&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dpictures%2Bof%2Bblack%2Bbaby%2Bcrying&amp;hl=en&amp;usg=__bG-HgAr1HlVzPlV249gEebpeWzQ=&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=image&amp;cd=1"><font size="4"><img width="135" height="90" border="1" align="middle" src="http://www.google.com/images?q=tbn:c1VMuvm7He7auM::www.christianpoint.org/inspiration/images/crying_baby.jpg" alt="http://rbgfenix.blogspot.com/2008/08/airports.html" title="http://rbgfenix.blogspot.com/2008/08/airports.html" /></font></a></strong></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;I looked at this little baby&#160;eyes, that she was carrying &amp;

picked her up.&#160; When they left the drive way she smiled at me &amp; I said that I was worried about her &amp; they drove away.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she had changed her mind &amp; decided not to have her baby killed.&#160;

When he got out of the car he came right over to David &amp; I.&#160; He said to us that he was there for the morning after pill because he wasn't ready to have a baby.&#160; I said that you were ready to have sex &amp; that'&#160;how babies are made.&#160; I said to him that the Morning after Pill can take a life of the baby.&#160; That if fertilization had occurred that the fertilized egg cannot plant in the womb &amp; the baby is sluffed off.&#160; That's taking a life.&#160; He said that the sperm was wasted by the condoms &amp; that the eggs were wasted by having a period???&#160; Then he said that he was Biology major , go figure.&#160; I said that when the sperm penetrated the egg, which is conception, which Is a baby.&#160; I don't know where he goes to school but some there doesn't know much.&#160; Then he said that there were to many people in the world something about overpopulation???&#160; I said that there isn't enough people in the world for their being killed by abortion &amp; that some countries in Europe do not enough people.&#160; Then I offered him a Truth packet &amp; to my surprise he took it.&#160; Then he saw the poster of the picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe &amp; went bonkers.&#160; He said "I knew that you were faith based, I knew that you were faith based" &amp; walked away toward the floor of PP &amp; went in.&#160; About 10 minutes later he came out without the Truth packet &amp; went to his car.&#160; A few minutes later he went back into PP &amp; when he came back out again he was holding the Truth packet, hooray!!&#160; When he was at the entrance of the parking lot he stopped the car &amp; rolled down the windows &amp; hollered "why don't you leave these people alone you are upsetting them in there &amp; why don't you just go home, they're going to do what they want to do anyways, just go home.&#160; I said "no, I'm glad that they are upset that means that they are hearing the Truth &amp; some of them are in there about to have their babies killed, we offer them the Truth about what they are about to do".&#160; Then he said to me "why do you care again, why do you care"&#160; I hollered back to him that "I was almost aborted".&#160; He hollered back&#160; "I&#160;was almost aborted too.&#160; I said to him in a stressed voice, "then why are you not with us if you were almost killed by abortion"?&#160; You must have an idea the fear that these poor babies feel &amp; you could have been killed but&#160;was spared.&#160; Then he asked him what education have I had.&#160; I didn't answer &amp; he asked again.&#160; David said that he is a student at the Eastman School of Music.&#160;He asked me again the same question&#160;&amp; then said "did you even graduate from High School"!&#160; It seemed that there was a war between him &amp; I.&#160; I then said that I was a nurse.&#160;&#160; I&#160;have not practiced nursing for a long time really ever since&#160;I was a nurse at Highland Hospital back in the late 70's that's when Morris Wortman (before he became an abortionist) at that time he was a resident had hurt my back. &#160;One day as I was walking down the hall, he was coming&#160;up the hall &amp; he grabbed my right arm &amp; swung me in the opposite direction.&#160; I felt like I was flying in the air.&#160; I ended up in the opposite direction of the hall.&#160; When I landed I knew that my back had been hurt.&#160; I&#160;told him so &amp;&#160;all he said to me was "no I didn't" but he did hurt my back.&#160; To this day I have a permanent partial nerve root compression at L5.&#160; Which means that I have a numb right leg &amp; also am in consistent pain &amp; discomfort.&#160; I offer it up to the Lord&#160;for his conversion &amp; that he would stop murdering little babies.&#160; Then the angry young man put himself back in the drivers seat &amp; drove away.&#160; Later on after David had left around 2 PM the police came.&#160; He said that someone had called &amp; said that I was harassing here.&#160; I told the good officer that I was not but only giving the people the information that they had not received before.&#160; That people get mad when they hear the Truth sometimes.&#160; I then said to him that I had Freedom of Speech that I was not threatening them but offering them help.&#160; He said that he had to come over because he got the call.&#160; I said that was fine officer for I've been out here for 13 years now (really even longer) &amp; that I know some of the officers like officers Mike &amp; Chris.&#160; He said fine &amp; then left.&#160; Poor kid, I know that he called the police &amp;&#160;later on I know that he will realize what went on today.&#160; For I hope &amp; pray "that today was the first day of his life".&#160; Only to start after he called the police.&#160; He was so confused by all the lies &amp; deception in his life until today.&#160; Usually you reject the Truth before you embrace it.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu6sOd49J1ykBJ5dXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBzYzBlYzNtBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA00wMDJfODY-/SIG=1lbivoo7h/EXP=1234225294/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253Dpictures%252Bof%252Ba%252Bmean%252Blady%2526y%253DSearch%26w=800%26h=600%26imgurl=www.beware-of-art.com%252Fimages%252Fjournal%252F2005%252F10%252Fmean-lady.jpg%26size=49.3kB%26name=mean-lady.jpg%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.beware-of-art.com%252Fimages%252Fjournal%252F2005%252F10%253FN%253DA%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.beware-of-art.com%252Fimages%252Fjournal%252F2005%252F10%253FN%253DA%26p=mean%2blady%26type=jpeg%26no=2%26tt=13%252C980%26oid=846890fd5caf0e3c%26tit=mean-lady.jpg%26sigr=11n0cls19%26sigi=11qufal2n%26sigb=12abhscn7" target="_self"><font size="4"><img width="115" height="86" src="http://ac4.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/846890fd5caf0e3c" alt="www.beware-of-art.com/images/journal/2005/10/mean-lady.jpg" title="http://www.beware-of-art.com/images/journal/2005/10/mean-lady.jpg" /></font></a></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A woman was driving her daughter into Planned Parenthood for an abortion I really felt it especially when I said what would the Lord tell you to do &amp;
