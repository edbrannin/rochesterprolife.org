 She said "we better go know because I'm fading fast".&#160; I said "lets go".&#160; We  walked down Gibbs St. to&#160;East Main Street to University.&#160; We had fun looking at  the stores &amp; buildings &amp; the people too.&#160; We got to University &amp;  then to Planned Parenthood where some cars were still in the parking lot.&#160; The  first thing I told the people in the two cars was that they kill children here  &amp; that they lie &amp; deceive you &amp; that we could help them.&#160; They were  very nasty I mean very nasty.&#160; Then we saw a young girl walk up the sidewalk.&#160;  We started to talk to her.&#160;

She then started to cross the street towards the center.&#160; Just then I saw  two young people a girl &amp; a guy walking down the sidewalk on my side.&#160; When  they got closer to me I asked the young girl if she needed a pregnancy test  &amp; she said "yes".&#160; I said "come follow me" &amp; then we started to walk  towards the front door.&#160; Our landlord was on the roof &amp; he hollered to me  "yes you can help me".&#160; I said "you're beyond help Bernie" &amp; we both laughed  as I opened the door to go into the center&#160;with the three people that were  following me.&#160; Thank God that Martha was already in the center opening up the  doors to the rooms.&#160; The young man said to me that they had just come from  Planned Parenthood &amp; was at Focus earlier this morning.&#160; I said that they do  abortions there which means that they kill children.&#160; He looked at me as if to  say that he had no problem with abortion &amp; I looked at him right in the eye  &amp; called it what it is&#160;"it's murder" I said to him.&#160; He then joined his  girlfriend that was already with Martha in the&#160;Counseling Room.&#160; I brought the  young lady into the Material Aid Room, to sign in the book that we have for our  clients, to sign with the date &amp; their name &amp; phone number.&#160; I showed  her where the bags were for her clothes &amp; things that she will be getting.&#160;  She said "thank you".&#160; I told her that I would be back, in a few minutes,&#160;&amp;  I went back outside to get some things from my car when I saw a woman get out of  a car &amp; come to the door to the center.&#160; I called over to her saying "just  give me a minute &amp; I'll be right over to let you in".&#160; She said "okay".&#160; I  got what I needed in my car &amp; then went to the door to let her in.&#160; She said  that we helped her so now she wanted to help us with two bags of baby &amp;  children clothes that she had for her granddaughter who's growing out of the  clothes so she wanted to give them to us.&#160; She said that they were all washed  &amp; mostly hadn't been worn for very long.&#160; I was so grateful to her for her  kindness.&#160; She said that we helped her with her daughter when she was pregnant  with love &amp; support &amp; she wanted to reciprocate with these clothes to  help out other mothers.&#160; I started to look in the bags &amp; saw so many nice  things.&#160; She then asked for some diapers &amp; asked if she could go into the  Material Aid Room for some things.&#160; I said "of course you can".&#160; The other woman  was in there &amp; the two women started talking &amp; hitting it off.&#160; The woman  who brought in the clothes was going to take the other woman home for they  discovered that they didn't live to far from each other.&#160; I said "how thoughtful  &amp; kind you are".&#160; Just then I had made mention of what Planned Parenthood  does to babies &amp; how they target the Afro American women to have their  babies killed.&#160; All of a sudden she said "I was heading over to Planned  Parenthood for a pregnancy test &amp; now I don't want to go in there".&#160; I said  "you need a pregnancy test so after Martha is finished with these two young  people I will give you one".&#160; The woman who was going to take her home said that  she had to go so I told her that I would give her bus money to get home &amp;  thanked her once again.&#160; Martha was in the Counseling Room for about 30 minutes  talking to this couple, so I knocked on the door, &amp; went in to get a  pregnancy test &amp; ran out quickly.&#160; I gave the woman a cup &amp; showed her  where the bathroom was.&#160; She was in there for about 5 long minutes &amp; when  she came back out she said that she couldn't give me a specimen.&#160; So I gave her  a big glass of water to drink.&#160; When Martha came out of the counseling room I  went in to get an Intake Sheet for my girl to fill out while she was waiting to  fill up her bladder.&#160; When the young couple came out of the room &amp; was  walking to the door I called to them saying "bye young couple" &amp; they said  "good bye" to me &amp; as they were opening the door I heard him say "this is a  great place".&#160; Thanks son.&#160; I told Martha about the dilemma about our other  client &amp; she offered her coffee &amp; she said that would be nice.&#160; So  Martha made a pot of coffee &amp; she had some of Martha's homemade coffee cake&#160;  too &amp; so did Paul who just came in.&#160; After that she went into the bathroom  &amp; then came out with a specimen for testing.&#160; I brought her into the  Counseling Room &amp; did the test which was positive.&#160; I talked to her for  awhile &amp; then I called Compass Pregnancy Care to schedule an ultrasound for  her, for the next day.&#160; I talked to her about her abuses, that she endured&#160;in  the past, which she filled&#160;out on the Intake Sheet.&#160; She said that she has  forgotten it &amp; is now moving forward.&#160; I said "hopefully with help" &amp;  she said "yes".&#160; I felt better then.&#160; After the test she wanted to go back into  the Material Aid Room to get some clothes for herself &amp; to try them on in  the bathroom.&#160; She came out with some clothes to take with her &amp; was happy.&#160;  I gave her money to get home today &amp; money to take the bus for the  ultrasound tomorrow.&#160; She thanked us for all that we did for her today.&#160; "No  problem, that's what we're here for", I said.&#160; She left &amp; I thanked God that  He gave me the courage to call out to her on the sidewalk.&#160;

I got to talk to Sheila  &amp; Dennis for a few minutes before they had to leave.&#160; Earlier this morning  Sheila called to ask where she could get more Truth packets, for she was running  out of them in her literature box, which is separate from ours that Martha, Rob  &amp; I use.&#160; I had put in seven packets but she was down to about three &amp;  she didn't want to run out.&#160; I told her she could get more in our box in the  cabinet.&#160; She was relieved &amp; so was I.&#160; I said "good bye" to them &amp; then  started to sidewalk counsel.&#160; I was waiting for Martha not understanding why she  wasn't here yet for it was now about 1:20pm &amp; I asked her last evening if  she could come at 1pm.&#160; Then the phone rang &amp; it was Martha calling to tell  me that she couldn't find her keys.&#160; I was already stressed out just by being in  front of an abortion mill, where they're murdering little precious babies that  God just created.&#160; I said for her to pray to St. Anthony the Patron Saint of  lost items &amp; then I said a quick prayer too &amp; hung up.&#160; It was less then  3 minutes later that the phone rang again &amp; it was Martha telling me that  she just found her keys &amp; was on her way.&#160; Thank God!!&#160;&#160;When I'm&#160;on the  front lines I'm not always calm, cool &amp; collective.&#160; I try to represent the  Lord but sometimes my flesh gets in the way which it did today.&#160; I heard people  talking so I went to the fence to see who it was.&#160; Come to find out it was the  two Death Escorts, taking away, in front of the Death Door.&#160; I screamed over to  them saying "shut up &amp; show respect for these children that are murdered  hear that you've help to kill".&#160; They greet the people &amp; hold the door open  for them,&#160;to walk into this horrible place.&#160; My emotions were rare &amp; I went  on &amp; on about other things too.&#160; We never curse or swear or say that you are  going to Hell but I do at times call name which I pray that I will stop.&#160; I  don't want to come across as a nasty pro lifer but one who is passionate to tell  the Truth &amp; to save both the mother &amp; child, from such evil, as abortion  is.&#160; &#160; </span></strong><strong> </strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong><strong> </strong></span>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">My cell phone rang &amp; it was  one of our clients who received a letter from Suzanne, our client advocate on  Thursdays, that we were&#160;unavailable&#160;to reach her because her phone was  disconnected. She called to tell me that her precious daughter Milagro was born  on April 4th. at 7lbs. 8ozs. &amp; to tell me that she did marry the&#160;father&#160;of  the baby, with our counseling &amp; encouragement. &#160;Yeah!! &#160; &#160;Mother &amp;  father &amp; baby are doing well.&#160;&#160;As I was writing this information down, on  a&#160;piece&#160;of&#160;paper when I was on the sidewalk, a car drove by me screaming "you  should have been aborted ". &#160;I thought to myself' I almost was' but the good  Lord saved me. &#160;One never knows what the other person has dealt with, in his or  her life, to say such terrible things. &#160;I forgive him. &#160;</span></strong><strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></strong>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Thank God that Martha had  arrived, it was 1:50pm.&#160; I was so happy to have her with me now.&#160; It's so  horrible, to say the least, out there.&#160; Three girls came out of Planned  Parenthood &amp; we flagged them over to speak to us &amp; they walked over to  us.&#160; We asked why they would be at Planned Parenthood &amp; the one girl said  "I'm going to have an abortion".&#160; "What" I said&#160; "why would you do that"?&#160;&#160; "I  don't want it", she replied "I don't want it" she said again.&#160; All of a sudden  &amp; I know that it was the Holy Spirit I&#160;asked her how far long is she.&#160; She  answered "I'm five months".&#160; I quickly said "you're not pregnant"!!&#160; She said  laughing "I just want to jive with you".&#160; I said "you have a problem young lady  &amp; I hope that you get help real soon" &amp; to the other girls I&#160;said "I  hope that you get away from her if she's your so called friend because she'll  drag you down".&#160; They all walked down the street to no where's  ville.&#160; <br /></span></strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span><br /><strong>&#160;</strong><strong> <span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">There</span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> was  construction work on University Ave. &amp; the workers had put drum right in  front of the entrance of Planned Parenthood's parking lot so it confuses a lot  of people they though that they couldn't get into the parking lot which was all  right with us.&#160; A car had driven passed the driveway but was looking at the  building s o I knew what was happening.&#160; I noticed that the car was driving into  our parking lot so I started to walk down the sidewalk to se if they needed our  help.&#160; I went over to them as they were getting out of their car &amp; I offered  them assistance &amp; I told them briefly about Focus.&#160; The one girl said that  they were going to Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said to them that if that was the case  that they couldn't park in our parking lot.&#160; So they got back into the car &amp;  drove to Gibbs St. to park on the street &amp; they walked up to Planned  Parenthood.&#160; As they went passed me I tried to tell them about that awful  place.&#160; I did mention to the one girl that her pants were to short, which she  didn't like.&#160; I was trying to help her but I'm sure under the circumstance she  thought that I was being mean or better yet, nasty.&#160; The one girl went into  Planned Parenthood &amp; the other girl with the short shorts stayed outside to  talk to the two Death Escorts.&#160; They must have told her that she could park her  car in the driveway because she came back towards us &amp; went down the  sidewalk to fetch her car &amp; drove into their parking lot.&#160; How deceptive  they are pretending to be so nice &amp; helpful.&#160; I hope that she will reflect  on this someday real soon.&#160; </span></strong><strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">A young girl was walking up the sidewalk &amp; she said that she  was against abortion but didn't like the graphic pictures &amp; thought that it  was a mistake for us to show them to people.&#160; I said that these pictures are the  truth of what Planned Parenthood is doing to these little children &amp; that  they have saved lives &amp; that's what it's all about.&#160; She was nice enough to  take the Truth packet as she walked down the sidewalk.&#160; I know that it's a Hard  Truth!!&#160; Then another young girl walked up the sidewalk &amp; as she came passed  me &amp; gave her a Truth packet &amp; gently mentioned to her that her shorts  were to short.&#160; I suggested that she adds about an inch or two to make them more  respectful looking.&#160; She took it well with a smile on her face &amp; no unkind  word was spoken, by her.&#160; Now that's how I like it :)</span></strong><strong> </strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was  on the brick side of the building for about an hour reading poems &amp; prayers  to the people going into the mill.&#160; Then she went over to the other side of the  street in front of the three condos.&#160; She wanted one of the signs so I went over  to her to give her a sign &amp; then came back to the bush side to counsel some  more.&#160; At one point I had to go into the center to get a hat for my head was  burning up &amp; while I was there I said "hi" to Paul &amp; Karen.&#160;&#160;When I came  back outside I saw that the neighbor Jim in the last condo the one that know  gives us the most trouble out on the front lines was hollering at Martha.&#160; He  saw me &amp; went into his condo, he probably was heading there when he saw me  for he's not afraid of little oh me.&#160; Martha then said to me, from across the  street, "Mary, Jim said that he was going to call the police".&#160; I said "if he  does they might arrest him for making bogus 911 calls".&#160; She said that he said  some pretty bad things to her &amp; gave her the bird, to which Martha&#160;told him  that&#160;she was going to tell his grandchildren what he did.&#160; She's so&#160;'to the  point' out there.&#160; What is wrong with him????&#160; He told Martha that he was trying  to sleep for he works nights.&#160; Get ear plugs!&#160; Martha said that she wasn't even  using the mega phone either.&#160; He's got real problems.</span></span></strong><strong> </strong><strong>&#160;&#160;</strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was said  to see Melissa, the Death Escort, walked up the sidewalk to go into Planned  Parenthood to put on her blue apron to greet the victims as she holds the door  open for them.&#160; This woman is post abortive &amp; the last time I saw her was  last year &amp; she was pregnant.&#160;&#160;I assume that she didn't abort that precious  baby but I really don't know for sure.&#160; She hasn't repented, for she was back  here, helping to kill other women's children.&#160;

She wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I asked Martha if she'd  give it &amp; she said that she would.&#160; I had so much to bring in from my car  &amp; much to do, so she was nice enough to assist the client, with the  test.&#160;The test was negative &amp; she was given educational&#160;brochures to start  over in her life also Martha did talk to her too.&#160; The young girl said that she  wanted the Depo Provera shot&#160;as a birth control &amp;&#160;Planned Parenthood told  her that there was a recall on the drug.&#160; This contraceptive as all are very  dangerous, to say the least &amp; we at Focus or I personally don't recommend  anything but abstinence as taught by the Catholic Church.&#160; This shot stops the  periods plus pulls out the calcium from the bones thus causing then them to be  brittle &amp; to break at any time &amp; any place, on the body.&#160;Most  importantly, like all the contraceptives, it can cause early abortions.&#160; This  means it takes&#160;lives.&#160; Funny I haven't seen anything on TV about the recall,  &amp; they say that there is a&#160;'War on Women'.

said"take these down".&#160; No way honey &amp; by the way what's your name?&#160;  She must have forgotten what the Constitution says about 'Freedom of Speech'.&#160;  It won't take any time or trouble to report her, for she was the only female out  there.&#160; Martha said that when she came by her again she looked&#160; at the picture  of Christ holding an aborted baby &amp; crying, she said nothing this time  around.&#160; She was touched by the Master's Hand.&#160; People across the street, in the  apartment,&#160;by the Eastman School of Music were hollering at Martha.&#160; It's time  to do something in your lives to save lives, don't you think!&#160;&#160; Martha doesn't  get rattled when people come against her, she's so cool.&#160;She talked to some  people &amp;

It's  dangerous for the mother &amp; her baby &amp; the mother is usually  C-Sectioned.&#160;&#160; Karen left a message on the voice mail &amp; then said "love you,  good bye".&#160; She laughed after she hung up &amp;

My heart sank, lets hope that it will be sooner.&#160; I invited her to come  to Focus to get some nice things for her son &amp; she said that she would.&#160; I  said "good bye" &amp; wished her the best &amp;

Norman Weslin passed from this life Wednesday evening. He was the  founder of the Lambs of Christ, a group that engaged in peaceful civil  disobedience at abortion clinics in the late 1980′s and early 1990′s.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Fr. Weslin was arrested and was jailed dozens of times at abortion clinic  sit-ins, also known as Rescues. He boldly placed himself between abortion-bound  women and the abortionists’ doors while pleading for the lives of the pre-born.  Many children were saved from abortion as the result of his sometimes  controversial ministry.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">“We mourn the passing of this great pro-life hero who lived sacrificially so  others who he would never know could experience the gift of life. May God bless  his eternal soul and richly reward him for his service,” said Troy Newman,  President of Operation Rescue and Pro-Life Nation.&#160; </span></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Also check out: &#160; http://www.priestsforlife.org/media/weslin.htm &amp; http://lambsofchrist.all-catholic.net/weslin.html</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></span></p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><em>Director Meeting  Minutes</em></span></span></span></p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Fundraising: </span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">United Way: Must  renew your designated giving<u> every</u> year or it goes into United Way’s  general fund.</span></span></p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">Egiving.com: Another giving option that accepts  credit cards.

Weslin had  died &amp; he said that he knew it already &amp; then gave me some Holy Water to  bless myself with &amp; then he took his stool &amp; sign &amp; went across the  street, to witness,&#160;where they were doing construction work.&#160; Dusty &amp; noisy  but at least we had the mega phones to get our message across.&#160; I turned around  to see that Mark was walking down the sidewalk.&#160; What a surprise, for I haven't  seen him in&#160;awhile.&#160; He said that he had taken the afternoon off &amp; decided  to come down to pray.&#160; Then Addison &amp; Adolf came &amp; they all went across  the street &amp; prayed the Rosary.&#160; It was now 1:20pm &amp; Martha had just  joined me coming from noon Mass on this Holy Day of Obligation.&#160; The team inside  the center &amp; outside were now assembled to do battle against the enemy of  our souls, through the power of God &amp; His Angels &amp; His Saints, to guide  us.&#160; Glory Be To God!!&#160; Martha decided to go over to the brick side of the  building so that all three sides would be covered with people.&#160; She took the  mega phone &amp; two Truth packets, two signs &amp; of course her very large  Rosary, so she could pray.&#160; I was alone on the bush side of the abortion mill.&#160;  A few minutes later a woman with a young boy maybe around 3 years old came  around the bushes.&#160; I spoke with her &amp; invited her to go to the center to  get some things for her son.&#160; She quickly corrected me to say that he was her  grandson.&#160; I said that we off 'free' clothes, books, toys &amp; stuffed animals  &amp; then I handed her a Truth packet.&#160; She took her grandson to Focus to get  some things for him.&#160; I just though that she was going home after that but she  came back &amp; went into Planned Parenthood &amp; I then started to smell a  rat.&#160; She later on came back out &amp; walked passed me again &amp; I now I  asked her if she had brought some one&#160;for an abortion?&#160; She said "I am by  myself".&#160; Later on I knew that she had lied to me for she had her daughter in  the car as she drove out of the Killing Mill&#160;more than&#160;2 hours later.&#160; I told  them both to repent for the sin of murder.&#160; You can try to fool me &amp;  yourself but you can't fool God.&#160; Now they have deprived this young boy of a  brother or a sister &amp; have put themselves in jeopardy of going to Hell  forever,&#160;if mother &amp;

said to  him that he was probably a nice guy but got involved with the wrong people that  will ruin him.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that he listened to the words of the Holy  Spirit &amp; won't come back again.&#160;

I pleaded with him for a long time hoping that he would get out of  his car &amp; go in there &amp; get her out of there with their baby still in  her womb.&#160; But no he didn't.&#160; She came out with her brown bag of condoms &amp;

I  opened all the rooms &amp; asked the younger girl to bring the boy into the  Material Aid Room to look around while I spent some time with the client.&#160; I  brought the woman into the Rose Counseling Room &amp; asked her to fill out the  Intake Sheet.&#160; I then set up the pregnancy test &amp; talked with her foe  awhile.&#160; After the test which was negative I talked with her some more. &#160;I gave  her lots of brochures about many subjects that we discussed in the counseling  room.&#160; She then went into the Material Aid Room to look around &amp; then they  all left.&#160; I said if you need to talk&#160;again please just call me.&#160; She said  "thank you, I will".&#160; When they left I decided to stay at Focus to do some work  &amp;

The minute Martha got out of our car there were  people waiting for us at the center to get things that they needed for their  children.&#160; It was non stop all afternoon with clients &amp; putting away  donations from the Second Thought Resale Store &amp; St. Pius the Tenth Church.&#160;  Thank you so very much!!&#160; We made up two Layettes, one for a newborn boy &amp;&#160;a  newborn girl.&#160; We are blessed with so may nice things thanks to the good people  &amp; their generosity.&#160; God bless you all.&#160; Later on the computer man Mark came  to fix the computer, in the office,&#160;so now it works so much better, thanks  Mark.&#160; Paul came earlier to help us &amp; I thank him for all his hard work.&#160; He  even fixed the men's bathroom door &amp; the kitchenette cabinet door, you are  so helpful to us Paul, &amp; thank you so much!!!&#160;&#160; It was about 7pm &amp; Pat  our grandmother &amp; great grandmother came for a visit &amp; for some diapers  for her 4 great-grandchildren.&#160; It's always great seeing her.&#160; She is stressed  from all the difficulties in the bad neighbor that she lives in on Frost Ave.&#160; A  very bad&#160;neighborhood.&#160; She had some dessert with Martha &amp;  I.&#160;&#160;We&#160;had&#160;Martha's homemade apple betty with ice cream, mmmm good.&#160; &#160;All in all  we had a very busy day helping a lot of moms &amp;

Martha went to Wendy's to get  lunch.&#160; The first client came &amp; asked for diapers &amp; formula.&#160; Then  Martha came back with lunch.&#160; I told her to eat fast before the doorbell rings  again.&#160; It didn't happen, so when I was half done with my 99 cent hamburger the  doorbell rang &amp; it was Dawn,from the Elizabeth Ministry,&#160;bringing us so many  wonderful donations, from the great people at St. Louis Church in Pittsford.&#160; We  even got diapers &amp; a double stroller &amp; so many clothes &amp; nice  things&#160;for children.&#160; Thank you so much Elizabeth Ministry &amp; the  parishioners at St. Louis Church, who donated all these terrific items.&#160; God  bless you! &#160;Just&#160;then, as I was speaking to Dawn, the young girl that called me  twice this morning came in to get what she needed.&#160; I had asked Dawn&#160;for  volunteers &amp; food items &amp; she said that she could help me out with  both.&#160; She said that she will go back to St. Louis Church &amp; ask for food  items &amp; she wanted to volunteer, at Focus on Wednesdays, from 1pm to 3pm.&#160;  Wow, that was a double heading!!&#160; We'll see her next Wednesday, to help us out,  in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Before she left she told me a story of&#160;a woman, who  when she was a teenager,&#160;back in the late 60's or early 70's, had an abortion.&#160;  She came from a large Catholic family &amp; she didn't tell anyone that she was  pregnant&#160;&amp; went for the abortion because going to college was more  important.&#160; Well, she did graduate as a teacher &amp; never married or had any  children.&#160; She looks at her pupils as her children &amp; deeply regrets her  'choose' many years ago.&#160; She said to Dawn that her child would have given her  much joy &amp; she&#160;was greatly remorseful of that awful decision, that she made  to abort her child,&#160;years earlier.&#160; She was grieving, the missed years that&#160;she  &amp; her son or daughter, would have had together.&#160; The deep regrets of  abortion!! &#160;I told Dawn about my grandmother &amp; her abortion, of my Aunt  &amp; almost of my mother.&#160; It was so sad a conversation but necessary.&#160; Check  out: Stand Up Girl @&#160;<a href="http://www.standupgirl.com/">http://www.standupgirl.com/</a>&#160;&amp;

literature box out to the front  lines.&#160; I said that I needed to stay in the center to do some things there.&#160; I  helped her to bring some things out to the sidewalk &amp; then I went back into  the center, to do more work there.&#160; Paul had just arrived &amp; now came  Valerie, our helping out client,&#160;&amp; today she brought her twins &amp; her  other daughter with her.&#160; She usually comes alone to help us out in the Material  Aid Room.&#160; Even with&#160;her children keeping her busy she was able to help out in  the Material Aid Room with our many clients.&#160; My cell phone rang &amp; it was  Pat, our grandmother, on the phone.&#160; She&#160;was bringing Katherine, her pregnant  granddaughter, to Embracing Options, pregnancy care center,&#160;for an ultrasound.&#160;  She was upset because she couldn't get into the building &amp; when Dee, the  director there,&#160;came down the stairs she asked Katherine if she was here for a  pregnancy test.&#160; Pat said sharply that she was already pregnant &amp; she was  here for an ultrasound &amp; they weren't going to take all those stairs, so  forget about it.&#160; I said Pat&#160;hang in there &amp; wait where you are until I can  get this straightened out.&#160; She cooled down &amp; I spoke to Dee &amp; she  understood the situation a little better now.&#160; She took them both to the back of  the building where there isn't any stairs to get to the center.&#160; Karen, who is a  volunteer at Focus, needs pregnant moms, in the first trimester to practice  ultrasounds on, so that she can get certified as a technician, at Embracing  Options, so that Focus&#160;can refer our clients there.&#160; It was a mess&#160;but thank God  it got straightened out.&#160; When I hung up on both parties, for I had one on my  cell phone &amp; the other on the phone in the office, I came out of the office  &amp; screamed "I can't believe it" &amp; then saying softly&#160;"I hope there isn't  any clients here".&#160; Well, there was Cleveland, our street friend, sitting on a  chair in the Green Room &amp; he misunderstood me to think that I was upset that  he was there, in the center,&#160;&amp; that wasn't the case but he was hurt &amp;  walked out very upset.&#160; Paul continued to make up his Ramon noodle meal &amp; he  then took it outside for him, but when he saw me he left very fast with his food  in hand, making a groaning noise.&#160; I now was hurt. &#160;I then called to him trying  to explain that it wasn't anything to do with him but another situation that I  was stressed out about but&#160;he wouldn't listen to me &amp; he acted very offended  as he was walking away.&#160; Sorry Cleveland :( &#160;I should have screamed in the  office with my door closed.&#160; Some bad professional behavior on my part.&#160; I hope  that he will listen to my explanation tomorrow, when I see him, on the street.&#160;

I asked Paul &amp; Valerie to take over in the  center &amp; if they had any questions just call me on my cell or come &amp; get  me from outside.&#160; They said okay &amp; I left.&#160; When I arrived to the sidewalk Martha  turned around&#160;to say to me "Mary, they're killing babies here today".&#160;

Check out:  http://www.nrlc.org/RU486/ru486info.html &amp; http://www.priestsforlife.org/articles/ru486.html.&#160; Planned Parenthood also kills babies by contraceptives, which are&#160;abortifacient drugs &amp;

I also use it to come against those obnoxious  people, that scream from their cars obscenities to us on the front lines,  &amp;&#160;I tell them to "repent" but I've been&#160;sidewalk counseling&#160;for awhile.&#160; I  know this sounds hypocritical &amp; maybe it is.&#160; We don't want to lose the  right to use the mega phone ,as part of our ministry, to save lives &amp;  souls.&#160; I don't trust anyone in this University Ave. neighborhood.&#160; Like I said,  later on today, as Martha was standing by the brick side of the building, was  approached by a car that stopped, with an older&#160;man &amp; a woman in it,&#160;to tell  her that they had just moved into the neighborhood &amp; asked "was the mega  phone necessary" to use.&#160; She replied that it was &amp; if you would like to  join us to save lives, you are more than welcome to stand with us.&#160; They drove  away quickly.&#160; See what I mean!&#160; The people in this neighborhood,&#160;&amp; some of  them have lived there for 20 years or more, have protected&#160; this&#160;Killing Mill  since the 80's, they&#160;should be ashamed of themselves for being quiet &amp;  letting this atrocity&#160;to continue.&#160; Their silence is their acceptance of this  holocaust.&#160; Lord have Mercy! <br /></strong></span></span></p><p><font size="2"> </font></p><div><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>As I walked into the door of the center I noticed a  couple of women in the Material Aid Room alone.&#160; I was anxious because I wanted  to get out on the front lines &amp; to relieve Sheila who had to leave at 1pm.&#160;  I ask them if they needed any help &amp; I was so happy to see that Karen was  already there &amp; she was helping them out so I was able to get outside.&#160; Paul  was leaving for lunch &amp; Sandy went with him.&#160; They said that when they come  back they will be working in the center.&#160; Before I left to go outside Karen told  me that she had to leave for her son sprung on her that she needed to be at a  school event last night.&#160; It was nice of her to come for the 30 minutes that she  was there to help us out.&#160; Thanks Karen!&#160; When I finally arrived on the sidewalk  to start to counsel I saw Pastor Everett standing there, I was so happy to see  him.&#160; I looked over across the street to see Mary Ann&#160;standing there &amp;  I&#160;waved 'hi' to her.&#160; Then I saw that Bill &amp; Dan &amp; Addison were, across  the street,&#160;already praying &amp; I waved to them.&#160; Just before Mary Ann left  she&#160;came over, to&#160;where I was standing &amp; gave me&#160;a package.&#160; I opened it up  to see that she blessed me with a beautiful silk scarf.&#160; Thanks Mary Ann, how  very nice &amp; thoughtful of you.&#160; Everyone was there but Martha &amp; she came  around 1:45pm.&#160; When she arrived she went over to the brick side of the Planned  Parenthood building, to pray &amp; to counsel.&#160;As she was crossing the street,  the nasty neighbor who lives in a condo across from the abortion mill, said to  her to "keep it down".&#160; He spent at least 30 minutes,  talking to probably the supervisor of the construction team, of the 5 condos  that they are building next to Jim the neighbor.&#160; Oh yeah Mr. Nice, only to some  people!!&#160; I was with Pastor Everett &amp; that was good.&#160; A few minutes later I  saw that a woman was standing by a car talking to a man in the car.&#160; I called  her&#160;over to where I was standing &amp; she came around the bushes &amp; I asked  her what she was doing at an abortion mill.&#160; She said that she brought her  daughter in for an appointment.&#160; I said to her that they do abortions today  &amp; was she sure that her daughter wasn't here for an abortion.&#160; "No" she said  she wouldn't do that.&#160; I said "I hope that you're right".&#160; I then invited her to  go to the center to pick up some things for her grandchildren, for she told me  that she had some.&#160; I showed her where the center was &amp; she went in.&#160; She  came out with a bad about 15 minutes later &amp; I recommended that she goes in  to see what her daughter is doing.&#160; I felt guilty that I didn't insist that she  did that before she went into the center.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that her  daughter wasn't having an abortion.&#160; Lord have Mercy on me!&#160; She drove out with  her daughter&#160;&amp; a young man in the front seat about an hour later &amp; she  waved 'good bye' to me.&#160; God only knows why her daughter was in there.&#160; A few  minutes later,&#160;I asked a man in a car, in the parking lot, why was he here?&#160; He  was nice enough to tell me that his granddaughter was&#160;here for an appointment.&#160;  I offered him some literature &amp; told him all about what Planned Parenthood  does.&#160; When the young girl finally came out I asked her if she had  an abortion &amp; she shook her head 'no', with a sweet smile on her face.&#160;  Thank you Lord!&#160; If anyone says....."it's none of you business", I disagree with  you, for I am my 'brother's keeper'.&#160; If&#160;she&#160;answers me that fine &amp; if&#160;she  doesn't....then she doesn't.&#160; I don't make&#160;her give me an answer I just hope  that&#160;she will &amp; that it will be "no, I didn't have an abortion".&#160; That's  what I want to hear!!!&#160; Another reason why I ask questions, to the people  waiting in the cars, is to offer them help &amp;

tomorrow is her last day".&#160; "What", I screamed,  "that's wonderful news"!!&#160; I then reached in the literature box to get out the  two DVD's, both on Planned Parenthood.&#160; He accepted them graciously.&#160; I saw that  he had put the Rosary that was in the Truth packet around&#160;his neck so I told  him&#160;that it was a prayer &amp; in the package it tells you how to say the  prayer.&#160; I then told him that he could carry the Rosary in his pocket but not  around his neck.&#160;

she was&#160;a short woman.&#160; Next time try to have some one  bring you to Focus.&#160; I have to be prudent for I don't want Paul to be in a  difficult situation to have to deal with.&#160; I'd rather be safe than sorry.&#160;

 He stayed with me which was great otherwise I'd be by myself.&#160; &#160;The first car  that pulled out was a woman who had an abortion earlier &amp; it was so sad to  see this.&#160;Then I spoke to a couple that pulled into the parking lot.&#160;

rode away.&#160; I knew this baby  was&#160;'saved' from abortion.&#160; Praise God!&#160; The graphic pictures, of babies killed  by abortion, showed these parents&#160;the truth of what they were about to do to  their baby &amp;

As they passed me on my side of the sidewalk I was hesitant to  speak with them&#160;but changed my mind through the grace of God.&#160; I hollered to  them saying "if you want 'free' baby clothes there is a center up the street to  your right that can help you.&#160; I said that because I knew that Sandy &amp; Paul  were now in the center.&#160; They turned around &amp; said&#160;"okay" &amp; headed for  the center.&#160; Boy was I surprised.&#160; I was happy that the dear Lord worked on my  stubbornness &amp; gave in to speak to them as they walked passed me.&#160; A few  minutes later&#160;I asked Tom if her would go into the center to get me more Truth  packets &amp; he&#160;said that he&#160;would.&#160; When he came back out&#160;he said to me "this  is Divine Justice".&#160; I said "what is"?&#160; He said the young&#160; girl that was mouthy  to you&#160;wants a pregnancy test.&#160; I said "really, would you hold down the fort  while I go into the center to give it to her"?&#160; He said "yes" with a smile on  his face.&#160; I walked into the center &amp; said "hi girls my name is Mary &amp; I  am the director here &amp; I heard that you wanted a pregnancy test".&#160; The thin  girl that was mouthy&#160;said to me "I don't believe in abortion either".&#160; I said  "then why did you give me so much trouble if we were on the same page"?&#160; She  said "I don't know".&#160; Okay, I thought&#160;let is go Mary.&#160; I was just happy that  they all were at Focus &amp; not Planned Parenthood.&#160;I brought them into the  Rose/Counseling Room &amp; gave the one girl the Intake Sheet to fill out.&#160; &#160;I  said that I would be right back &amp; went into the Ladies/ Gentleman's Room to  make sure that all was&#160;clean &amp; neat&#160;before I sent&#160;her in there for a  specimen.&#160; When I came out to my surprise there was Martha standing there.&#160;  Praise God &amp; thank you Lord was my&#160;response.&#160; I was so happy to see her  that's for sure because I needed to get back out to the front lines with Tom.&#160; I  quickly told her what was going on &amp; asked her if she would give the  pregnancy test to our new client&#160; &amp; she said that she would.&#160; Thanks  Martha&#160;for your cooperation in this matter.&#160; I went into the Rose Room &amp;  told the young lady that Martha was going to assist her at this point.&#160; No  problem.&#160; It turned out that she was pregnant &amp; will be going for an  ultrasound on Wednesday at Embracing Options where Karen, our volunteer, will be  doing it.&#160;&#160;All went well with the counseling session.&#160;

It's always horrible.&#160; All I can say to them &amp; to the&#160;driver  is "repent of the sin of murder".&#160; To give them a chance to save their  souls&#160;from going to hell.&#160;&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I saw that Bill was here for his sign &amp; then he  went across the street to witness.&#160; The builders were digging up the ground  across the street wooing on building the new condos.&#160; I guess we'll be having  trouble with some of the new owners when they move in.&#160; I'm not looking forward  to it.&#160; Some of us pro lifers were joking around saying that we should buy one  of the condos&#160;so that we could be out in front of Planned Parenthood more  often.&#160; If I only had $250,00 I would.&#160; I turned around to see that Addison  &amp; his wife had arrived.&#160; They told me that Dan, the other prayer warrior,  had fallen up the stairs &amp; hurt his leg &amp; was now on crutches.&#160; I asked  Addision to say "hi" to him for me.&#160; He said that he would.&#160;&#160;I saw that Pastor  Everett was getting out of his car.&#160; I was so happy to have him here with Martha  &amp; I.&#160;&#160;&#160;Martha then decided to go over to the  other side of the building &amp; took some Truth packets with her &amp; the  prayer card, that she reads hoping to save a life.&#160; Then&#160;a car pulled into the  parking lot&#160;&amp; the right behind the first car came the&#160;second car.&#160; Two  females got out of the first car &amp; two females got out of the second car.&#160;  Martha was closer to them then I was so she spoke to them.&#160; The one girl was  upset saying "I'm having a miscarriage &amp; I'm going to have it sucked out of  me".&#160; Well, fist of all a regular D&amp;C there is a scraping of the contents of  the uterus &amp;&#160;there is no suctioning at all.&#160; So I think that Martha was  suspicious &amp; said "if you're having a miscarriage then why don't you go to  the Emergency Department of the nearest Hospital&#160;&amp; not to an abortion  mill"?&#160; &#160;She was worried about her care&#160; at this&#160;abortion mill.&#160; She acted  rightly about this situation.&#160; The girls said something to Martha &amp; it  probably wasn't nice &amp; they all walked into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Later on  when they came out the one girl took my picture &amp; another girl&#160;told me that  I was going to Hell.&#160; Go figure!!&#160;&#160; The only thing I could think was that,  all&#160;that Martha &amp; I had spoken, had disturbed the&#160;girls because they were  post abortive due to their reaction&#160;to what we had said out there on the front  lines.&#160; </strong></span></span></div></div><p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></span></span></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">A woman drove into the parking lot with two young  children in the car.&#160;

The joke would have been on  her as&#160; the police arrived.&#160; All I tell her or anyone is the TRUTH &amp; people  don't like the truth.&#160; She was nasty &amp; combative &amp; I told her that I  would pray for her.&#160;

Then two guys in a car came by &amp;  the passenger was almost on top of the roof of the car screaming at me &amp; the  driver added his scream too.&#160; Again I told them to "repent for their abortion  involvement".&#160; Then another car with a man in it also screamed at me &amp; you  know what I said to him too.&#160;There were five men, who are in pain &amp; misery,  from their abortion past.&#160;How sad was this to see!!&#160;</span></strong><strong>&#160;</strong></div><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Then Martha came out for she was in the center  helping our clients &amp;

stopped.&#160; He sad "can I ask you both a question".&#160; I said  "sure".&#160; He then went on to say "if you knew that a baby was going to be born  gay would you&#160;abort this baby"?&#160; I said "here we go again" for I have heard this  lame question before.&#160; I said "of course&#160;NOT".&#160; "Oh", he said "I'm glad to hear  that".&#160; Oh brother, I thought, for we are the ones that don't believe in killing  children even if they are conceived in rape, which isn't their fault &amp;&#160;they  should be protected &amp; be born.&#160; No one should murder a child, in the  mother's womb, least of all the mother herself.&#160; &#160;Well it went on &amp; on &amp; on.&#160; One bizarre question after  another.&#160; He had a scientific mind &amp; they want proof of everything &amp;  they don't live by faith but by reason, which isn't always the case.&#160; He finally  left after a frustrating time.&#160; Martha &amp; I did our best to answer his  questions after invoking the Holy Spirit.&#160;

to the Referral List, more agencies  &amp; churches&#160;that can assist our clients with their needs.&#160; Then Liz, from the  Catholic Family Center, came to get the layette for one of her clients that is  due any day now with a baby girl.&#160; Well we started talking &amp; talking &amp;  talking.&#160; In the meantime Ni came to help us out, for she is our Monday evening  volunteer, &amp; then Anne came to drop off the donations from Kathy.&#160; I felt  badly for I never really got a chance to speak with Anne today because I was  with Liz.&#160; All this happened at once.&#160;Liz wants to promote Rachel Vineyard for  post abortion women &amp; men but is having difficulty in this diocese. In the  meantime, Martha went out by herself, to the front lines.&#160; Not good idea but  sometimes we have to because we don't have enough people for the center &amp;  for the sidewalk ministry.&#160; Then Paul came to help us out &amp; I was sure glad  that he did.&#160; He cleaned all the strollers &amp; car seats &amp; the baby swing  that we just received.&#160; He was working non stop.&#160; Ni put away the clothes, from  the Great Room,&#160;into the Material Aid Room &amp; answered the door &amp; helped  out our clients that came into the room for clothes &amp; small items.&#160; She even  fixed the curtain in our new bathroom &amp; Afandi, from the taxi company, put  the new lock on&#160;our bathroom door.&#160;

She met Martha out on the sidewalk &amp; she referred our new  client to Focus.&#160; I got up, from my desk,&#160;&amp; went into the Material Aid Room  &amp; met our new client.&#160; I introduced myself to her &amp;

She was thrilled.&#160; She said that she went over to Planned Parenthood  &amp; they weren't very nice to her once she told them that she was keeping her  baby.&#160; She thanked me &amp; said that she will be coming back here tomorrow.&#160;

Whatever that is &amp; we know that it isn't good.&#160; She  saw Martha's picture of Jesus holding a baby that was just aborted &amp; was  crying &amp; the other picture of an aborted baby.&#160; She made a snide remark  saying "die, die, die, we all die".&#160; Yes we all die but we're not all murdered  &amp; one doesn't usually die before one is born.&#160; Then all of a sudden she sat  down by the wooden ledge, surrounding the big bushes, &amp; put her hands over her  face, like she was ashamed.&#160;

a yellow cake with fruit filling.&#160; I had received a phone call&#160; when  they were introducing me so when I came back into the room Jann was saying "Mary  is in the bathroom".&#160; When&#160;I came into the room she said " oh this is Mary".&#160; I  said that I was answering the phone &amp; it was a client &amp; she'll be coming  in at 2pm.&#160; I guess I gave this information to 'save face'.&#160; It sounded better  than being in the bathroom.&#160;

 Those murders!!&#160; Planned Parenthood is so sick &amp; evil!!&#160; Then a very  pregnant mom came in &amp; we asked her to fill out the Intake Sheet &amp;  Martha gave her a Layette for her&#160;baby boy, who will be born in August.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Martha &amp;

We took inventory of what we needed to buy for the picnic supper after  the Mass.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; Martha answered it.&#160; Then I realized that it  was the young man, who told me a story, about a week ago&#160;&amp; I gave him  some&#160;money &amp; he was suppose to come back&#160;to pull up the weeds around&#160; the  building, as payment,&#160;but&#160; he never came back to do what he promised.&#160; I  told&#160;Martha not to let him into the building.&#160; She told him to go next door to  see if they could help him.&#160; He needs more than their help for he does have  problems that we can't solve.&#160; Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on  me.&#160;&#160;Abe Lincoln.&#160;He fooled me twice so see how I felt :(</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Paul had left so Martha &amp;

&#160;What are the  chances.&#160; They talked  for a few minutes &amp; Martha arrived back from the  nursing Office.&#160; I  was standing there on the sidewalk when a man walked by me  &amp; he  said something very awful about the picture of the aborted baby that I   was holding.&#160;

 stopped.&#160; I though to myself 'no  he isn't'.&#160; Well I was right 'he did',  he pulled down his pants &amp; mooned  me.&#160; Oh no!&#160; I knew in the past  that I did&#160;have a man arrested &amp; he had to  go to court because he  pulled down his pants, in public.&#160; He was told by the  judge that he had  to stay away from me for 6&#160;months, on the front lines.&#160; I  asked if  anyone on the sidewalk had seen him do that &amp; they said "no" &amp;   we just called the police about an hour ago about the knife incident  &amp; I  thought that by the time the police get&#160;here the guy would be  gone, so what  bother.&#160; I called over to him &amp; that he could get  arrested for this bad  behavior&#160;he looked surprised.&#160; If he does it  again I will call the police.&#160; He's  not right, in the head, &amp; is  probably post abortive, so why doesn't he get  help.&#160;

My heart aches for a woman, named Barb, who came into the Focus  Pregnancy Help Center yesterday &amp; she tried to get her friend to come to  talk to us but she went to Planned Parenthood instead, to prepare for an  abortion.&#160; The boyfriend left her &amp; she has two young girls &amp; not much  money, so she will take her third child's life, because life isn't perfect.&#160; Her  friend Barb, who is pro life, came to Focus to get some things for her child  &amp; I gave her lots of brochures &amp; DVD's &amp; helpful phone numbers to  give to her abortion minded friend.&#160; I hope that she will 'choose'  life!</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">After Paul left I continued to do work in the office &amp; all the  rooms.&#160; I was so sad that no one was out on the front lines today, for Planned  Parenthood was scheduling &amp; preparing for abortions on Thursday.&#160; Where are  all the people dear Lord to take a stand for 'LIFE'  ???</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I went to the polling place in East Rochester to vote pro life in  the primary tonight, me &amp;&#160;11 other people, made a point to vote today.&#160; How very  sad.&#160; My candidate did win the primary!!&#160; I was happy about that.....</span></span></strong></div><p>&#160;<strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></p><hr /><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wednesday, June 27,  2012 at Focus</span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the day of our Mass that will be celebrated  by Fr. Joe Catanise, Pastor of St. Leo the Great Catholic Church, in Hilton, NY.&#160; I arrived at the  center at 1pm &amp; there were three moms&#160; already waiting for me.&#160; I opened up  the center quickly &amp; lead them into the Material Aid Room to get what they  needed for their children,&#160; On of the moms was pregnant &amp; is due in August  &amp; the other mom had brought her two beautiful daughter with her.&#160; It was  Dajah.&#160; I haven't seen her in quite awhile &amp; I was blessed to have seen her  today.&#160;She got some nice things in the center for her two daughter &amp;  herself.&#160; The one young girl got the pink car &amp; she put two stuffed animals  in it, how cute was that!&#160;&#160;The mom&#160;thanked me that I was out in front of Planned  Parenthood the day that she was going for an abortion of her youngest daughter.&#160;  She&#160;was happy that I was outside&#160;calling out to&#160;her not to go in there to have  her baby killed.&#160; I was glad that she 'choose life' for her sweet &amp; precious  daughter, here today at Focus.&#160; I said to her that this was the same person that  was in her womb &amp; look at her know.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; told her that I  was proud of her &amp; that she is doing a great job &amp; that if she needed  us, at Focus,&#160;for anything just come or call me &amp; we will be happy to help  her.&#160; She smiled &amp; said "thank you".&#160; My heart was thrilled as we said "good  bye', that she wasn't suffering post abortive stress, &amp; that she did the  right thing &amp; that her daughter was in her life &amp; in the lives of  others.

The  Great Room, where the Mass was celebrated, looked 'great'.&#160; After Mass our friend Dean gave  his testimony to the 25 people that attended tonight.&#160; After his testimony, I  said a few words, &amp; then we were all lead into the Green Room, for a picnic  supper.&#160; It was marvelous, simply marvelous!!&#160; Thank you Lord for a wonderful  day at Focus.&#160; God be the Glory!!!
