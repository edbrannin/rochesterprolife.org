then she did the pregnancy test on the box  on the table.&#160; I hope tomorrow will be better.&#160; We are using the ‘new’ pregnancy  test which I like a lot.&#160; It takes three drops of urine for the testing &amp;  three minutes for the results.&#160; Much better!&#160; Her test was ‘negative’ so I had a  talk with her.&#160; I went &amp; got her a Truth packet &amp; all of our DVD’s &amp;  more brochures.&#160; She said that she was trying to get pregnant.&#160; I said that is  only with your husband &amp; your not married.&#160; I talked to her about many thing  in our time frame.&#160; She asked me for Adoption information, for she wanted a  child, so I gave her Bethany Christian Services, an adoption agency &amp; asked her to call to talk with one of the counselors. &#160;One never knows, though I don’t  think that she has the financial means, but she has the heart.&#160; She was a nice  young lady.&#160;&#160;

I showed them the two Material Aid rooms &amp; after they shopped  they went to the food pantry to get some food.&#160; On the way to the front door she  stopped &amp; said “do you do pregnancy tests”.&#160; I said “yes we do”.&#160; I went  &amp; got Martha who was just finishing up an other pregnancy test which was  negative.&#160; There really wasn’t any place to do the tests but we found areas to  do them.&#160; Next week I will be asking the Fidelis Care woman to move to the Great  Room were she will have privacy &amp; we will have our pregnancy  testing/educational room back again.&#160; That will work out much better for us  &amp; for our clients.&#160; Martha did the test &amp; I saw that it was positive.&#160;  The client said that she had had a pregnancy test &amp; a Depo shot at Freedom  of Choice on Lattimere Rd.&#160; This is really an abortion clinic &amp; I told her  so.&#160; I asked if she would like to have an ultrasound done &amp; she said “yes”  so I called &amp; made an appointment for the next day at 1:45 pm at His  Branches.&#160; I wanted her to have appointment soon for when I said to her earlier  that I hope she wasn’t thinking of an abortion she replied “I am now”.&#160; I told  her that it was a murder against her own flesh &amp; blood &amp; showed her  pictures of an abortion &amp; the man who was with her. &#160;I asked if he was the  father of this baby she was carrying &amp; he said that he was the father of  these two children too.&#160; I asked if they were talking about marriage &amp; she  he said that they did at one time.&#160; I said maybe that time is now.&#160; I don’t  encourage bad marriages &amp; this isn’t one of them.&#160; He needs to make her his  wife for she is the mother of his children.&#160; It’s so hard Lord, please continue  to help me.&#160;&#160; I then gave her the brochure for her ultrasound appointment &amp;  told her to drink lots of water before hand.&#160; I gave them directions &amp; he  was satisfied he knew how to get there.&#160; We all said ‘good bye” &amp; they all  left.&#160; I was worried that she would befall an abortion.&#160;

I believed her but now I wonder if she was involved.&#160; So much  to worry about.&#160; I asked Martha if she would talk with her because she was at  Focus last Thursday with a young man too.&#160; She said that she will be induced  with this baby that she’s carrying on Friday.&#160; She has two sets of twins &amp;  another child &amp; now this child &amp; she isn’t married &amp; I spoke to her  about abstinences when I did a pregnancy test on her a year ago when it was  negative but she didn’t listen.&#160; One only hopes &amp; prays that she will do the  right thing&#160;&amp; this girl is a Catholic too.&#160; Lets say I’m watching her &amp;  her friends when they come into Focus.&#160;&#160; Martha gave her more diapers &amp;

showed them the two rooms to  shop.&#160; I asked how they new about Focus &amp; she said it was the sign on the  sidewalk.&#160; I was happy to hear that.&#160; A few minutes later I saw that the young  man was all over the center which made me nervous.&#160; The I heard him say  something not nice to the little child.&#160; I went over to him &amp; said that I  was not happy in&#160;what I heard &amp; for him not to do that again.&#160; The mother  then said to me “he’s my 14 year old brother &amp; he’s immature”.&#160; I said that  is child abuse &amp; it can’t continue.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that this mother will  ALWAYS protect her innocent child from him &amp; from others.&#160; Lord have  Mercy!!!&#160; I do suspect him as one of the ones that could have possible stolen my  money on my desk.&#160; God &amp; he or she know for sure.&#160; I had to forgive whoever it was &amp; to be more careful when I’m away from the office.&#160;

She said that she was going to come to Focus  real soon.&#160; I was in confused.&#160; I worked in the office &amp; about 20 minutes  later she was there....I was happy that she was alive &amp; well.&#160; She said that  she was called by her friend early this morning saying that she had fallen out  of bed &amp; she needed food &amp; Martha called me but didn’t leave a message  on the voice mail because she thought that that would wake me.&#160;

I talked her out of it.&#160; She said that he loves their daughter  now so much.....&#160; She said that he was in the parking lot in the car.&#160; I asked  her if they were planning to get married &amp; she said that they have been  together for 5 years but he’s married in another country.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; She  said that she stays home taking care of her daughter &amp; doesn't do drugs or  smokes or drinks but I thought you’re with a married man!&#160;

I  said that I though that it was only in Ms..&#160; The one&#160; person said “no we won in  all cities”.&#160; I said (but I was thinking that only Ms. won) “oh, that’s great”.&#160;  I left a about a minute later to go into Focus to start my work there.&#160; I went  to my car to get some things out &amp; I went into the grocery store next to  Focus &amp; asked the men to help me bring the donation bags into the center.&#160;  Two men helped &amp; I was grateful.&#160;

I noticed that  it was the man who was out on the sidewalk praying.&#160; I thought that he was  needing more truth packets or was giving us a donation, which he has done in the  past.&#160; I walked up to the door &amp; said “hi” to him.&#160; Then he hit me with a  shocking remark saying :the police were called &amp; they all were there on the  sidewalk but I have to leave.&#160; I said that I would go out to give the pro lifer  some support.&#160; I went tot get my cell phone, keys &amp; sunglasses&#160;&amp; I told  Martha where I was going &amp; left.&#160; When I got to the sidewalk &amp; spoke to  the pro lifer &amp; I saw the police officer in the parking lot of Planned  Parenthood.&#160; I asked what had happened.&#160; She said that the police were called  because she was in the buffer zone.&#160; I asked her what she had said to the  officer.&#160; She said, I told him that “this is infringing on my Constitutional  rights”.&#160; She left a few minutes later so I knew that she&#160;wasn't&#160;going to be  arrested.&#160; I told her that I would stay to speak to the officer.&#160; I saw, through  the bushes, &#160;that he had papers in his hands &amp; it probably was the 2002  Injunction.....poor officer.&#160; It’s 26 pages long.&#160; A few minutes later I saw  that he was walking out to the sidewalk.&#160; As he was&#160;approaching the sidewalk I  said to him ”can I speak to you officer”?&#160; He said “yes” &amp; he walked over to  where I was standing.&#160; We talked about the situation &amp; he said that he  called his Supervisor to see what the ruling in Ms. met here in Rochester.&#160; I  instructed him what Planned Parenthood&#160;does to little babies &amp; their  mothers.&#160;I told him that I will be at the Focus Pregnancy Center &amp; I showed  him where we were located so when he finds out I’d appreciate it if he comes by  to tell me.&#160;

I said ‘thank you” &amp; walked back in the center.&#160; It was  later on that the officer came by &amp; he said that he&#160;didn't&#160;have an&#160;answer  for me yet.&#160; I asked him if I should notify my attorney &amp; he said that that  would be a good idea.&#160; We talked a few more minutes &amp; he left after he shook  my hand.&#160; I wish that I got his name he was a&#160;very nice police  officer.&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I went to the office &amp; looked up  our attorney’s phone number &amp; called her officer.&#160; When she got on the phone  I spoke to her about the situation out on the front lines.&#160; She told me that it  was only in Ms. that the Supreme Court decision affected so we have to remain in  the same position as always.&#160; We also talked about changing the Injunction here  in Rochester where she said that we are Constitutional but Mississippi’s buffer  zone&#160;wasn't.&#160; In 1999 I went to the Federal&#160;Court, in Buffalo, &amp; the Judge  placed us 80 feet away so we were standing across the street for 21/2 years  until we won the appeal in 2002.&#160; The Circuit Court stated that we were to far  away to protest, so they moved us back on the sidewalk in front of Planned  Parenthood, stating that the buffer zone was now 15 feet at each entrance.&#160; I  emailed all the people, that are out on the front lines, to say that all remains  the same here in Rochester.&#160; All don’t agree so if anyone wants to cross over  into the buffer zone, it’s up to them, not me.&#160; I pray that we can get closer on  the sidewalk so that we can speak to the people with our human voices &amp; not  have to use mega phones anymore.&#160; We have the Truth &amp; we want to give it to  them.&#160;

He’s going to see the sights.&#160; When he  comes back he’ll tell us all about his trip.&#160; Be safe Paul.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Thursday is always a difficult day for me because Planned  Parenthood murders little precious babies, who are people, who God created.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Later on&#160;Rob came in &amp;
