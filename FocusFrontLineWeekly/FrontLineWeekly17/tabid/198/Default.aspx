cart with many things in it.&#160; I was already stressed  &amp; I said to her "Donna, you can't take all that from the center"!&#160; She  replied that she didn't that she had only taken some things &amp; all this was  her stuff that she has from her apartment &amp; she is moving.&#160; I apologized  vehemently.&#160; Then I saw that there were two people getting out of their car  &amp; heading into the center.&#160; Paul was telling me that he had to leave to go  to eat.&#160; Oh no!!!&#160; I needed to get out on the front line to relieve Sheila who  leaves at 1pm.&#160; I'm only one

me.&#160; I greeted her.&#160; She  said that she needed to tell me some things that happened out on the front lines  today.&#160; I said "okay Sheila".&#160; Paul took over in helping the two people in the  Material Aid Room.&#160; Sheila told me that a mother &amp; daughter, came out of  Planned Parenthood,&#160;&amp; they stopped to talk to her.&#160; She said that the  daughter was about 5 months pregnant &amp; Planned Parenthood referred her to  someone but they&#160;really didn't want an abortion.&#160; The mother said that she was  Catholic &amp; she doesn't believe in abortion.&#160; Sheila told her that Mary will  call her later tonight, to set up an appointment, to get some help for you &amp;  your daughter.&#160; She was relieved to hear that there was help&#160;for her &amp; her  pregnant daughter.&#160;&#160;She gave Sheila her name &amp; phone number to give to me to  call her after 9pm tonight.&#160;I did call her around 10 PM tonight &amp; they will  be coming to Focus on Tuesday for assistance.&#160; She sounded&#160;very relieved &amp;  even&#160;sounded&#160;very happy.&#160; I&#160;told her to relax &amp; to enjoy &#160;her daughter's  pregnancy because it will go fast.&#160; She agreed.&#160; I&#160;said "good bye &amp; that I  will see her &amp; her daughter at the Focus Pregnancy Center on Tuesday."&#160;&#160;&#160;She  said

So!!!&#160; I walked in to see if this was the same woman, who I wrote a note  to, saying that she couldn't come&#160;back into the center to get things from the  Material Aid Room, until August. &#160;I looked around  the room &amp; I didn't spot her until she got up from the floor for she was in  a basket filled with clothes hoarding again.&#160; I quickly recognized her &amp;  said sternly "you have to leave right now &amp; don't take anything.&#160; I sent you  a note telling you that you couldn't come back until; August.&#160; No I was here,  she&#160;said.&#160; You were here three times, at the end of June, &amp; you take so  much, we need to have things for other people when they come in.&#160; She started  speaking in Spanish.&#160; I said "you can take what you already have &amp; no  more".&#160; I noticed that one of the children&#160;had a large white plastic bag filled with  toys.&#160; I said "dear, you can't take that, you can take one thing &amp; no more".&#160;  She stated crying, like mother like daughter.&#160; The other daughter was holding  two dolls in her hands so I said "only one".&#160; The aggressive mother was going  into the white container to get a plastic bag.&#160; I said "no more things".&#160; She said  "shish, I'm just getting a bag for the things I already have".&#160; "Okay" I said.&#160;  Her mother was on the floor getting things so she spoke to her in Spanish &amp;  she stood up.&#160; She told the girls to share the dolls, so each girl had one doll,  like it should be.&#160;I told the mother that this was her fault that this&#160;was  happening.&#160;&#160; I said "I told you in the note not to come back until August".&#160; They were now  gone.&#160; She was probably bad mouthing me, in Spanish,&#160;as she passed some other  clients that were Hispanic, that were waiting to come into the Material Aid  Room.&#160; Another thing is when she was in last she had another woman who she said  was her mother .......how many mothers do you have?&#160; And that woman came back  another time telling me that she was never here before.&#160; Lies, lies &amp; more  lies!!!&#160; I hope &amp; pray that I nipped this abusive&#160;situation in the bud!!!&#160; I  went into the other room to tell Martha what had just happened.&#160; She said "good  Mary".&#160; We can't have people coming in &amp; lying to us &amp; abusing our  Material Aid Room.&#160; We gave her a double stroller &amp; I never see it when she brings in the  children.&#160; I sent her the instruction manual for the stroller with the note in  it saying we'll see her in August &amp; not sooner.&#160; She is a very aggressive  woman &amp; I needed to be strong &amp; not to back down.&#160; I need to protect the  other clients that come in for things, we want things for them too.&#160; I told Martha that this was hard for me.&#160; She said "I know Mary".&#160; It's hard to be a director &amp; to have to make all kinds of decisions.&#160; Come Holy Spirit come!!!<br /></strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The doorbell just continued to ring &amp;

for the Focus  ministry too.&#160; I then called the mother, to confirm&#160;her appointment at 4pm  today, with her daughter.&#160; I was given very sad news that her mother in law died  in a fire this past weekend.&#160; Her daughter's grandmother.&#160; We rescheduled for  next Tuesday at 4 pm.&#160; I gave her my symphony &amp; guaranteed her my  prayers.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I then called my other client that was coming in  with her sister to receive help.&#160;

I knew that she was pregnant so I asked her to fill out the Intake  Sheet.&#160;&#160;After she was finished I took a look at it to see that she had an  abortion about a year ago.&#160; I was so sad to see this so I addressed this issue  first.&#160;I talked with her about the abortion &amp; God's forgiveness in taking a  life that He just created.&#160;She said that she wasn't ready.&#160;I said that if you  are pregnant then you are ready.&#160; I was disturbed to hear this from her.&#160;I said  that abortion is always evil &amp; it takes a life that God intended to have  here on earth.&#160; I said that adoption or parenting&#160;are the two options NOT  abortion. &#160;I gave her a Project Rachel brochure to call&#160;a counselor anytime to  talk with her.&#160; Then I gave her lots of brochures on&#160;prenatal care &amp; breast  feeding for her baby, in her womb. &#160;I gave her a new doctor list because she  said that she is seeing the same doctor ( abortionist Steven Eisinger) that  aborted her fist baby.&#160; I said that it was bizarre to see the same doctor, that  killed your first baby, to&#160;give you prenatal&#160;care with this baby.&#160; She said that  there were two doctors on our list that she would consider calling because there  were close to where she lives.&#160; I called up Pat Smith, who&#160;deals with domestic  abuse cases, who had just left the center about 20 minutes ago, for she had an  appointment with another one of our clients that is experiencing domestic  abuse,&#160;her &amp; her husband took her home from the center after their talk.&#160; I  called her up&#160;to see if she could&#160;meet with&#160;our new client&#160;to discuss the abuse  that she's experienced in the past from the former boyfriend &amp; the father of  this baby.&#160;&#160;An appointment was made for next week at Focus&#160;to meet with our  client to get help for her in this&#160;area of her life.&#160; Her sister now came into  the&#160;counseling room with her baby &amp; she told me her story about the physical  abuse of&#160;her former boyfriend &amp; the father of her baby.&#160; I said that she  could also speak with&#160;Mrs. Smith that day.&#160; She was happy to hear that.&#160; I went  into the Green Room where we had a box of new baby clothes &amp; I gave each of  them something for&#160;their baby.&#160;&#160;They were very happy.&#160; We all said "good  bye"&#160;&amp; I said that I will call them to remind them of their appointment a  week from this Thursday.&#160;

This is still America &amp; we should be in front of Planned Parenthood &amp;  not in front of Buckpitt &amp; Co..&#160; It's to bad but they never objected, to the  court, only after the decision was made&#160;that they gave&#160;us nothing but trouble,  over all these years, for us being where the court put us.&#160; Go figure!&#160; I say  "put up or shut up".&#160;&#160; But this time it was my fault for I did have the sign  closer to their exit, not realizing the problem&#160;with the people exiting,&#160;until  she drove out screaming at me to "put the damn sign down".&#160; How disrespectful of  her to say that about this sign with the aborted baby Malachi on it.&#160; I wonder  if she's post abortive?&#160; I did put the sign down vertically &amp; hollered back  at her saying "you don't care about these babies".&#160; I am always on the defense,  on the front lines.&#160; We have been persecuted, so many times over the many years,  that we've been out there,&#160;by the neighbors &amp; businesses, that sometimes&#160;I  think that they are just trying to be mean to us protesters because we're there  &amp; they don't want us there.&#160; Then&#160;I realized, through the grace of God,&#160;that  maybe they can't see very well of the traffic coming down the street.&#160; I needed  to change that!!&#160;

I did apologize &amp;  reassured her that I would co operate with them at Buckpitt&#160;&amp; rest assured  her of their safety, as they drive out, onto the street.&#160; I said that sometimes  I'm not aware of my positioning of the signs, for&#160;I don't ever drive out of  Buckpitt,&#160;so kindly ask me to move them &amp;&#160;I will.&#160; I said "lets work  together for we have a right to be there but not to cause you &amp; your  employees any danger, &amp; that's not what we want, for we protect &amp; defend  life.&#160; Kim said "okay" &amp;

to help her.&#160; I then introduced her to Suzanne &amp; they  both went into the Counseling Room.&#160; I closed the door &amp; then went into the  Material Aid Room to get a baby item for her.&#160;

&#160;I said "hi" &amp; asked her how she was doing.&#160; She said that she  was doing fine &amp; was heading to Focus for some children things.&#160;  &#160;I said that Martha was in  there to help her.&#160; It was so nice to see her after her delivery.&#160; She did say  that she will bring&#160;Aaron in soon for us to see.&#160; Yeah!!&#160;</span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><div><strong>&#160;<strong> </strong>&#160;</strong><strong> </strong>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Rob started to bring the signs into the  center around 5:15pm &amp;

<br /><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A very busy day!!&#160; Martha &amp; I saw at least&#160;24  people,&#160;including kids, that came into our pregnancy center, needing  assistance.&#160;&#160;The doorbell rang no stop.&#160; I had a stressful morning before I even  got to the center so I was tired at the end of the day &amp; so was Martha.&#160; We  were sad that one of our clients, who we haven't seen in awhile came in &amp;  ended up&#160;in the Green Room, which I said was&#160;just for the workers.&#160; This  particular person is involved with drugs &amp; apparently got clean about a year  ago.&#160; Well time changes everything.&#160; She came in &amp; we greeted her for we  haven't seen her in awhile.&#160; She comes in to get a few things for her child but  today she took a whole package of wipes that I just purchased for the  center.&#160;&#160;It&#160;contained 420 wipes &amp; we put in about 15 or so into a sandwich  baggy for when we give our moms the diapers.&#160; So by what she did this means that  the moms won't get wipes with their diapers.&#160;&#160;"Thou Shall Not Steal".&#160; She is  now barred from Focus for life.&#160;&#160;Don't come into our center &amp; lie &amp;  steal from us, for if you do, you will not be welcomed back.&#160; It's your choice.&#160;  This was very upsetting for Martha &amp; I.&#160; Our hearts were sad because we  liked Tina, I just wished that she'd like&#160;herself. <br /></strong></span></div></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Karen, our Tuesday client advocate,&#160;came in did a  pregnancy test right off the bat &amp; then worked in the office creating a list  of good pro life doctors.&#160; Then she&#160;emailed the list to Mary Aramini, an  attorney, that requested it.&#160; Thanks Karen....great job!!&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Martha &amp; I were  calling the companies for instruction manuals for the product, like the car seat  &amp; strollers.&#160; What a long time this took.&#160; Very frustrating, to say the  least.&#160; Finally is was completed.&#160; One of our moms came in to receive her 'free'  stroller after I told her that she would have to put the parts that I just  received from the company in place before she could take it home.&#160; Karen helped  her &amp; they finally got it together &amp; it became safe.&#160; She put her baby  in it nice &amp; safe.&#160; I felt good about her now taking it out of Focus.&#160; She  was happy about her new stroller for her precious baby.&#160;Her older son had a good  time in the Material Aid Room picking out toys while his mom worked on the  stroller. </strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The doorbell rang &amp; it was&#160;a grandmother &amp;  her&#160;granddaughter.&#160; She wanted a pregnancy test.&#160;&#160; She said to me as we walked  down the hall towards the Counseling Room, "I don't believe in abortion".&#160; I  said back "that's great".&#160; She is 15 years old &amp; just had a baby.&#160; The  father&#160;of the baby was arrested for statuary rape &amp; spent some time in jail  &amp;&#160;there is an order of protection out on him.&#160; As they were discussing some  things&#160;with Martha,&#160;I&#160;chimed in saying&#160;"the answer is simple:&#160; NO SEX".&#160; It was  a foreign message in the ears of this young girl.&#160; I could read her mind saying  "that's not going to happen lady".&#160; Okay my dear,&#160;wreck your&#160;health by&#160;getting  the Depo shots &amp; get all the STD's that there are.&#160; Have fun!! <br /></strong></span></div></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I was very busy in the office making copies &amp;

Martha answered it  &amp;&#160;there was&#160;three women&#160;walking down the hallway.&#160; My 4pm appointment has  now arrived.&#160; This is the young girl &amp; her mother that came out of Planned  Parenthood, a week &amp; a half ago, that Sheila had spoken to &amp; said that  Mary would call &amp; set up a time at Focus to help them.&#160; Here they were.&#160; I  gave them my sympathy, in regards to the loss of her mother in law &amp; the  grandmother of her two&#160;daughters, that lost her life in a fire on Bay St. over a  week ago.&#160; They said that they were still in shock.&#160; "I know, it takes time", I  said back to them.&#160; I then showed them around.&#160; I brought them into the Material  Aid Room first to show them the 'free' store for those who are in need.&#160; Then I  brought them into the Counseling Room to start the interview.&#160; I gave them two  DVD's &amp;&#160;many brochures, all for educational purposes.&#160; I asked if&#160;she had a  OB doctor &amp; I&#160;she&#160;said "no".&#160; I gave her our Good Doctor List &amp; the mom  called &amp; has an appointment for her daughter tomorrow to come in as a 'new  patient'.&#160; I was happy that she got a pro life doctor that will take good care  of her &amp; her baby.&#160; I informed her that we will do follow up calls to see  how she is doing &amp; if she needs anything along the way towards the delivery  of&#160;her baby.&#160;&#160;Her &amp; her mom were pleased that we cared,&#160;at  Focus.&#160;</strong></span>&#160;</span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font size="2"><font size="3"><strong>I was  very busy in the office making copies &amp;

I said "yes we  do".&#160; I gave him our hours today &amp; he said that he will&#160;come in, this  afternoon, with his client.&#160; I said that I will see them later.&#160; I stopped at  the Dollar General Store to get more size 5 diapers for the center &amp; baby  wipes.&#160; They were stolen yesterday at the center.&#160; I meet Martha at Mass &amp;  then we went to the center.&#160; Melissa&#160;came&#160;to the center to help us out.&#160; Our new  volunteer!!&#160; I came into the Green Room to open all the doors to see that the  bathroom door had the key in the lock again.&#160; Counterproductive to say the  least.&#160; I talked to Tickaboo about this.&#160; Then I said out loud "I'm having a bad  day all ready".&#160; Then Melissa made it worse.&#160; She said&#160;that she just got  promoted to days.&#160; "What", I exclaimed.&#160; She said that&#160;we weren't going to lose  her it just would be different days &amp; hours.&#160; "Okay" I said &amp;  congratulations on your promotion.&#160; Then I put her to work no stop from 1pm  until 3:20pm before she had to go to work.&#160; She is marvelous, simply  marvelous!!&#160; She's a no stop 'go getter'.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha decided to go out to the front lines by  herself.&#160; Lord please protect her.&#160; He always does.&#160; When she came back into the  center around 3pm she told me that today was an abortion day.&#160; She saw that some  of the girls, were&#160;slumped down in the back seat, as the driver was driving  out.&#160; The abortionist, Rachel Phelps, left around 2pm after she had killed some  children.&#160; Lord have Mercy on her soul!&#160; The people were very nasty to her as  they were driving by.&#160; Typical.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I received a call from a mom saying that she was  coming into the center for some things for her young son,&#160; I said "just come on  in &amp;&#160;we'll see you then".&#160; My plan was to have Melissa work in the office  but that was put on hold for awhile for we were so busy in the Material Aid  Room.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was our mom who had called earlier.&#160; She was  filled with much energy.&#160; She was so grateful that Martha had stopped her on the  sidewalk about two years ago asking if she needed anything.&#160; She was pregnant  with her son, who is about a year &amp; a half now.&#160;She lead her into Focus  where she was warmly greeted &amp; was shown the Material Aid Room where she got  some things for her unborn son at that time.&#160; She was most grateful for the love  &amp; hospitality&#160;of Focus.&#160;&#160;We were able to give her the High Chair that we  have in the Great Room.&#160; She was thrilled.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again &amp;  it was the counselor &amp; his client.&#160; I greeted them both &amp; lead her into  the Material Aid Room to shop for her&#160;two children.&#160;&#160;She &amp;&#160;our other mom hit  it right off.&#160; I asked Melissa if she would go into the Material Aid Room to  help&#160;out the moms which she graciously&#160;did. &#160;I then showed the counselor around  the center &amp; asked him some questions about some things &amp; then let him  sit with a magazine &amp; a bottle of water in the Green Room as he was waiting  for his client to finish her shopping.&#160; &#160;He was very nice &amp; thanked us for  helping out his client.&#160; He said that Focus was first on his Referral List &amp;  he was happy that we were able to help out his client today.&#160; She said that she  had a lot of baby clothes to donate to us.&#160; I hope that she can get these things  to us ASAP.&#160; We are so busy &amp; the clothes are going so fast.&#160; God always  provides for us!!!&#160; Thank you Lord for&#160;providing for&#160;Focus :)</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang again &amp; it was a pregnant mom  &amp; her friend coming in for baby clothes.&#160; I asked Melissa if she would bring  the pregnant client into the Counseling Room to fill out an Intake Sheet so that  we can check her progress &amp; see how she is doing &amp; if she needs anything  in the future.&#160; They went into the Rose Room to do the paperwork.&#160; She asked us  if we had a baby car seat.&#160; It so happened that we did &amp; it was hers.&#160; She  was so happy.&#160; I told her that this is rare &amp; please not to tell anyone for  they might think that we have a supply of car seats in the back room &amp;  that's not the case at all.&#160; She smiled &amp; said "mum is the word".&#160; I said  "thank you".&#160; She also received some helpful brochures to take home with  her.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I was determined to get the next doorbell, for I  wanted Melissa to now work in the office, on our Petition Letters to the  Churches.&#160; She critiqued the letter to make it better.&#160; She did a great job!!&#160;  It was time for her to leave &amp; she said that she had a wonderful  experience&#160;here&#160;today.&#160;&#160;I said that she was a blessing to us.&#160;She&#160;is scheduled  to come&#160;back, a week from this Thursday,&#160;from 6pm to 8pm.&#160;I asked if she would  be interested&#160;in working on a spread sheet, to put information about our clients  on it.&#160; She said that she would but that she doesn't really do well working on  spread sheets. But I have a feeling she will be challenged by this  request.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was in the center now, thank God, for we  were so busy.&#160; A nice lady from India, who is&#160;now an American,&#160;came into the  center to tell us about her church &amp; what they have to offer.&#160; This church  takes Catholics away from the one True Church.&#160; You can only get food if you  attend their religious service.&#160; No way!!!&#160; She was nice but misguided.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the doorbell rang again &amp; it was a  pregnant mom needing baby clothes.&#160; I took her into the Counseling Room, to fill  out an Intake Sheet, so that we could check on her&#160;during her pregnancy. &#160;I saw,  on her sheet, that she had an abortion, in the past.&#160; I asked her some questions  about this.&#160; She said that it was two years ago at Planned Parenthood &amp; it  was early in the morning.&#160; When she came out there were protesters there.&#160; She  saw the graphic pictures &amp; immediately regretted what she had done.&#160; She  said that she only wished that we were there to stop her.&#160; I wish we were there  for her too.&#160; I gave her a Project Rachel brochure that she was hesitant to  take.&#160; She said that there were other girl's having an abortion ,that day, but  she was the only girl crying.&#160; She also says that she got right with God &amp;  she writes poems about what she did.&#160; Thank God.&#160; She took the other car seat  &amp; a breast pump &amp; some baby clothes.&#160; Martha brought her  home.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was our client that just  had a baby.&#160; She came in for clothes for her young daughter.&#160; She said that she  was living with her step father but was angry with him for bringing in bed  bugs.&#160; She &amp; her daughter were moving out of the home.&#160; Oh  yea!!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang again.&#160; She was a client that I  gave a pregnancy test to about 3 months ago.&#160; She came in with her&#160;four  children.&#160; I did the test &amp; it was negative.&#160; I spoke to her, about many  things, the first time she came into the center for a pregnancy test &amp; I  gave her lots of information too.&#160; I thought that I would not do that again  today.&#160; I just asked her not to have sex, for she needs to take care, of her  four children.&#160;I hope that I got through to her today.&#160; After they left I notice  a piece of paper that the one child made into a plane &amp; unraveled it.&#160; It  was a paper from Planned Parenthood.&#160; So I think that she went over there first,  with her family, asking for a pregnancy test &amp; they refused so she thought  of Focus &amp; came here.&#160; That's fine with me!!&#160; She &amp; her children were  blessed at Focus.&#160; God is Great all the time.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of our sweet clients came into the center to  get the stroller, the last car seat &amp; the pink princess table &amp; chair  for dress up, for her two girls.&#160; She was so happy.&#160; Martha &amp; I had fun with  the two sweet girls.&#160; The younger girl was going to be aborted, at Planned  Parenthood,&#160;but the mom was stopped by me talking&#160;her out of it, through the  grace of God.&#160; The mom's happy &amp; I'm happy but most of all God  is&#160;happy.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I made supper tonight &amp;

Martha came at the  same time.&#160; We went into the center.&#160; Dan was there &amp; what a surprise that  was for I hadn't seen him in awhile.&#160; He told me that he was applying for  another job so that he could get off of nights, which is so difficult.&#160; He was  nice enough to do some vacuuming &amp; odd &amp; end jobs while he was waiting  for a phone call.&#160; Karen came&#160;just arrived for I had asked her if she would come  in today to take the place of Suzanne, who had another commitment today&#160;&amp;  she was nice enough to say "yes".&#160; Martha had sent, into the center,&#160;three girls  that just had come out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Karen lead them into the  Counseling Room to talk to them.&#160; It turned out that one of the girls&#160;is  pregnant&#160;&amp; wanted an ultrasound.&#160; Karen called Dr. Morehouse's office to  schedule a pre natal&#160;appointment &amp;&#160;an ultrasound, for Wednesday.&#160;Karen  told&#160;the client&#160;that she needed to go to DSS tomorrow,&#160;to apply for Medicaid, so  that she could see the doctor. In the meantime&#160;one of the other girls, they were  all close friends, wanted a pregnancy test.&#160;&#160;I&#160;found&#160;out later that she had an  abortion in the past &amp; so did the young girl that is pregnant that we're  caring for.&#160;Thank God that Rob came around 1:20pm for I didn't think that he was  coming today because his family was celebrating his father's birthday.&#160; He said  that he had to leave at 3pm today.&#160; Martha went out to the front lines to join  Bill &amp; Addison &amp; Dan &amp; MaryAnn.&#160; She came back in at times to help  Sr. Frances,&#160;&amp; her friend Georgia's niece, to get a permanent place to live  with her young child.&#160; We gave them a referral list &amp; they called around to  these places.&#160; They were nice enough to bring some baby things for our&#160;clients  children.&#160; Then Donna, our client,&#160;came in for&#160;her appointment with Mrs. Smith  for assistance.&#160; We have a program now, to help woman who suffer from domestic  violence, with the aftermath from the abuse.&#160; Mrs. Smith came in at 1:30pm &amp;  I lead them both into the Great Room to talk.&#160;Then two women who could not speak  English came into the Material Aid Room to get some things for her baby boy who  will be born soon.&#160; I called in Dan to help her write her name in the&#160;admittance  book.&#160; Paul&#160;came in with&#160;a piece of gauge on his head.&#160; I asked what  had&#160;happened to him &amp; he said that he ran into a Stop sign.&#160; I didn't have  time to ask him more questions regarding this unfortunate event.&#160; He had to&#160;get  5 staples put in his head &amp; the hospital first put the wrong ones in &amp;  had to take them out &amp; put the right ones into his scalp, Martha told me  later on.&#160; She had more to time to talk to our dear &amp; helpful volunteer  Paul.&#160; Now we know why he didn't come in on Tuesday &amp; Wednesday.&#160; Paul  please watch out for the Stop signs, we need you in one piece.&#160; Poor baby  :(</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I literally could not get out to the front lines  until about 1:45pm for we were so busy in Focus.&#160; I at least had some peace  knowing that the team was out there trying to save lives.&#160; When I finally did  get out there Martha told me what had gone on the street.&#160; First the neighbor  Jim, from the condo across the street, came out &amp; harassed the team &amp;  then egged on the men from the Volunteer's of America, who came to pick up some  things from his condo,&#160;to harass our Korean War Vet Bill, who sits on a stool  holding a graphic sign.&#160; Lord have Mercy!&#160; Then a man in a car drove right up to  the curb right next to where Martha was standing &amp; asked him what he was  doing.&#160; He said "why are you bothering me, I'm working on taking down  information&#160;regarding speeders on University Ave.".&#160; Then Martha replied that  when a car comes so near the curb she gets worried.&#160; He said back to her "then  maybe you shouldn't be here &amp; by the way why are you hear"?&#160; Martha told him  that they do abortions here at Planned Parenthood&#160;&amp; he replied "so".&#160; He  didn't care, in the least, that they were murdering little precious babies.

Vitto  exclaimed to the Judge that it was a cut &amp; dry case, that he provided a  service &amp; wasn't paid.&#160; He lost.&#160; I say Vitto "what come around goes  around".&#160; Please don't tell anyone that you a Catholic until you can prove it.&#160;  Doing business with murders, you deserve what you get.&#160;&#160;No sympathy here.&#160; By  the way it wasn't very nice to use foul language to Sr. Frances &amp; Georgia  because they accidentally parked in your parking lot in front of you business.&#160;  God didn't like that lack of charity.&#160; I hope that you repent &amp; make  reparation for your sins, soon.&#160; What happened to you Vitto?&#160;&#160;&#160;When&#160; Focus&#160;was  doing business with you, a long time ago, you were nice, at least I thought so.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The cars were coming out of the parking lot&#160;with  mothers that had just killed their child.&#160; How horrible this is for me &amp; the  team.&#160; Martha went back into the center &amp; Rob had gone &amp; so did everyone  else but Adolf, who arrived later this afternoon.&#160; Then I saw that the  abortionist, Rachel Phelps, was getting into her car.&#160; It was a short day of  killing because she killed babies yesterday too.&#160; When she drove out I said what  I said to her.&#160; I&#160;am sick to my stomach, when I see an abortionist, who are  murders of the innocent.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha a came back out to join me &amp; we stayed  out in the hot sun witnessing the Truth.&#160; I looked across the street to see our  neighbor Jim spying on us &amp; using his video camera.&#160; I just ignored him  because he craves attention.&#160; Then Martha said that he was suffering from Post  Traumatic Stress Syndrome &amp; maybe the mega hone reminds him of the war.&#160;  Well my heart ached for him.&#160; I decided to walk over across the street to  rationally speak to him.&#160; I looked up at him in the window &amp; said that I  know what he was going through with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome because I  suffer with it too.&#160; I was hoping for a connection.&#160;We talked for a few minutes  when my cell phone rang.&#160; I answered it &amp; then spoke with the person &amp;  then hung up.&#160; I was walking back to be with Martha when I saw that Jim was now  outside.&#160; He asked if I would come into his condo.&#160; I said "no".&#160; We spoke again  but it went badly.&#160; Then the neighbor, from Whalen St., came by,&#160; as if I needed  this duo coming against me.&#160; I knew that I wasn't getting anywhere with these  two men so I left to go back across the street to join Martha.&#160; I decided to get  the paper that I received from Thomas More Society that says that what he is  doing is&#160;Second Degree Harassment.&#160; Jim said "bring it on for I'm going to take  you to court for you using the mega phone so loudly".&#160; I said that I had the  Lord &amp; he said that he had Buddha (as if he could help him).&#160; He's suppose to be a Catholic.&#160; My dear brother, what happened to you?&#160; How sad was this!!&#160; I said back to him  that I wasn't going to charge him with this anything but I wanted him to know&#160;  that we have our rights out there, on the sidewalk too.&#160;I harbor&#160;no animosity  against Jim, for he is a likable character but confused.&#160; He lives right across  an abortion mill &amp;&#160;come against us pro lifers??&#160; &#160;How sad.&#160; I asked him what  he was going to say to the Lord when He asked him if he saved any lives while he  lived across from an abortion clinic?&#160; I'll continue to try to love him &amp; to  pray for him.&#160; "Pray for those who persecute you", the Bible says.&#160; I did holler  over to the both men that they need to spend their time better.&#160; I went on  sidewalk k counseling at the abortion mill.&#160; I looked over across the street  &amp;&#160; saw both men looking at the big project that the builders were doing next  to Jim's condo.&#160; &#160;I only hope &amp; pray that the new neighbors will leave us  alone.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I told Martha that I was going in the center&#160; for  a few minutes.&#160; When I got to the door there was two people ringing the  doorbell.&#160; They weren't together &amp; they both wanted baby formula.&#160; I said  that we didn't have any &amp; I gave them phone numbers of other agencies &amp;  pregnancy centers&#160;that could help them.&#160; Paul was just leaving &amp; I said  "good bye to him &amp; thanked him for all his hard work at Focus.&#160; We  appreciate all our volunteers, they are invaluable :)</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I went back outside to be with Martha &amp; we  stayed for another 45 minutes &amp; went back into the center.&#160; Then I received  a very upsetting phone call from one of our clients asking for money so that she  could leave Rochester with her three children to get away from her abusive  boyfriend that she just had arrested.&#160; She was frightened that when he gets out  of jail tomorrow that he would come back to hurt her.&#160; She said that he got her  into drugs &amp; prostitution.&#160; I told her to get a Order of Protection out on  him but she said that would make him more mad &amp; it doesn't even work.&#160; I  said all I could give her was $10, for we are a small pregnancy center &amp; we  don't have funds like that.&#160; Just then the doorbell rang &amp; it was our three  mature volunteers.&#160; I asked the leader of the pack if she would speak to her  &amp; she then took the phone &amp; spoke with her for about 3 minutes or  longer.&#160; The client hung up on her.&#160; She said that she told her to call the  police &amp; to tell them of her fears but she didn't seem to like that advice.&#160;  We were also suspicious that she wanted drug money &amp; this is how she tried  to get it.&#160; Drug money from a pregnancy center, how odd!!&#160; <br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span></div></strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Our three volunteers brought us diapers &amp;

The doorbell rang &amp; it was Valerie &amp; her four children.&#160;  She helped out in the center &amp; her twins were not happy in the stroller.&#160;  Martha &amp; I gave the two older children a snack, which was now on the  carpet.&#160; Oh well it's only crumbs.&#160; One of our volunteers vacuumed up the food  on the floor.&#160; Everyone was working very hard.&#160; Martha ate quickly for she  wanted to go to her Holy Hour at St. Jude's.&#160; I stayed after everyone had gone  &amp; did more work in the office &amp; then went home.&#160; Thank you Lord for a  blessed Focus day.&#160; </span></div></span></div></strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><div>&#160;</div><hr /></strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></span></div><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Friday afternoon, July 13, 2012&#160;at Focus</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I met my friend &amp; her adopted daughter, from  China at the Church of the Holy Spirit this morning for the 9am Mass.&#160; After, we  got to visit for awhile before she &amp; her daughter left for Virginia, to  visit her son who just got engaged to be married.&#160; It was so good seeing her,  for she now lives in Florida with her family.&#160; Hopefully they'll come back to  Rochester to live someday.&#160; I went back into the church &amp; spend an hour with  the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.&#160; Then I was headed to Focus to drop off the  donations that were in my car.&#160; I first stopped at the second hand store &amp;  bought a picture for my kitchen &amp; a red blouse with long sleeves for the  Fall &amp; two pairs of pants.&#160; Buy one &amp; get the next pair free.&#160; What a  deal!!&#160; I arrived at Focus &amp; went over to stand at my usual post by the tall  bushes &amp;&#160; the tree &amp; spoke with a Hispanic woman, with her two  grandchildren.&#160;She walked over with the children to where I was&#160;standing on the  sidewalk.&#160;told her that Planned Parenthood was bad for women &amp; that they  kill little babies in there.&#160; She said that her daughter was in there.&#160; I told  her about Focus &amp; pointed in the direction where we are located &amp; told  her that I will be in there for about an hour &amp; for her to bring her  daughter in when she gets out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told her that we had  'free' children clothes &amp; things for her two grandchildren.&#160; One of the  grandchildren looked like he was going to bite her arm so I told him not to do  that.&#160; She was very nice.&#160; I then walked back into the center&#160;&amp; knocked on  the accountant's door &amp; spoke with him in regards to our 990 Form.&#160; I felt  that something was accomplished with this meeting though I am still disturbed  with what he did to Focus.&#160;&#160;I told him that I was sorry for anything that I did  or said that hurt him for it wasn't intentional.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I then got the donations&#160;out of my car &amp;

I saw two young  girls standing by the front door smoking.&#160; I called over to them &amp; saw that  the one girl was walking over to me.&#160; I said to myself that she was going to be  nice or not nice but I had the good Lord to protect me.&#160; She was nice.&#160; She said  "I know that you wanted to tell us something by we couldn't hear you".&#160; I told  her about Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that either she or her friend believed  in abortion &amp; that her friend was hear for a ovarian cyst.&#160;&#160;I told her about  Focus after she said that she had two children.&#160; I pointed to where we are  located &amp; she said that she had time right now to come to get 'free' things  for her children &amp; her friend who only has the clothes that she's wearing.&#160;  She was so happy to see the Material Aid Room &amp; all that we had to offer for  her &amp; her children &amp; for her friend.&#160; She picked out some nice things  &amp; was so very grateful.&#160; She opened up in the Material Aid Room, which so  many woman have, to tell me that she almost had an abortion.&#160; It was at the  Freedom of Choice on Lattimore Dr..&#160; She saw the protesters there &amp; started  to cry to her mother&#160;&amp; told her that she couldn't go through with it.&#160; Thank  God that her mother took her home for she had told her daughter that if she  didn't have an abortion she would kill herself.&#160; What a horrible thing to say to  her pregnant daughter.&#160; Well she had the baby &amp; then about two years later  had another child.&#160; She was so nice &amp; respectful &amp; so grateful that we  were here to help her &amp; her friend.&#160; I told her that she could come back  again &amp; to bring her friend.&#160; She left a happy camper.&#160; Later that day I  called up Mike Warren, who was one of the protesters that day &amp; told him  that he &amp; Gerry &amp; their team saved a precious baby!!!&#160; He was thrilled  :)&#160; What a blessed afternoon!&#160;&#160; Thank you Lord!!</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong><strong> </strong></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><font>Tuesday, July 17, 2012 at Focus</font></span></strong></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I woke with a my cell phone ringing &amp;

I cleaned that mess up then  my cell phone rang.&#160; I was getting ready to go to the post office to pick up a  check for our client Pat, our grandmother, written by a friend of mine for her  granddaughter's security deposit for her new apartment so that she can get away  from the evil neighbors that surround her.&#160; It was a very hot day &amp; I&#160;was  bringing food for our supper tonight, baby formula &amp; baby food, for the  center &amp; I didn't want it all to spoil or be effected by the hot weather.&#160;  The doorbell rang &amp; it was the Gas &amp; Electric man wanting to come into  the basement to read the meters.&#160; I went back upstairs to finish up &amp; then  heard the fire truck coming down the street.&#160; I left my apartment to see that  they were in the parking lot.&#160; I asked if everything was okay &amp; they said  "yes".&#160; What happened was the Gas &amp; Electric man went over to the duplex  next door &amp; smelled gas so he called the fire department to check it out.&#160;  Thank God that all was well.&#160; I was on my way to the Post Office only to see  that the check had not arrived so I headed to the pregnancy center to drop off  all the perishable items that I had in my hot car.&#160; No air conditioning just a  fan, which works okay.&#160; I arrived to Focus &amp; as I was getting out of my car  one of the taxi drivers came out of the store which is net to us.&#160; He said that  he had some things for the center from his daughter &amp; wanted to drop it  off.&#160; I said "thanks" &amp; then I asked&#160;him if he would help me bring all the  things in my car into the center.&#160; I said "thank you".&#160; Then I saw a young lady  walk up to the door &amp; I quickly said that we weren't open until 1pm &amp; it  was now 11:45am.&#160; I asked her want she needed &amp; she said that se wanted a  pregnancy test for Planned Parenthood wouldn't do it because she didn't have her  ID for her Medicaid.&#160; I said "come on in".&#160; I brought her into the counseling  room &amp; started the process.&#160; I completed the test &amp; did some education  &amp; then brought her to the Material Aid Room for her three other children.&#160;  She was very happy.&#160; Everything was brought in from my car &amp; the taxi man  brought me his donation too.&#160; All is well &amp; I was headed off to Mass.&#160; I sat  with Martha &amp; we were blessed by the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.&#160;

Thanks so much Karen we really appreciate this.&#160;  Martha had just given out the last of the size 5 diapers to a man that came in  for diapers &amp; some clothes for his baby.&#160; He told Martha that his  girlfriend, who is the&#160;mother of his baby is still married to her husband who is  abusive who she is afraid of&#160;hurting her,&#160;if she divorces him.&#160; Life can get so  complicated &amp; twisted!!&#160; Martha suggested  that she comes in on Thursday at 3pm to speak to Mrs. Smith, who is an advocate  for women that have been or are being abused,&#160;for a free consultation &amp;

&amp; went out on  the front lines.&#160; Martha went out to join him.&#160; I stayed in the center to help  out some clients that had just came in for assistance.&#160; Suzanne, our client  advocate,&#160;will come later on, I hope, for she's having problems with her  house.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I finally made my way outside to join the team&#160;on  the front lines.&#160; A car drove in to the parking lot &amp; I called out to them  to offer them help but they went in anyway.&#160; Then two people, in a bright blue  truck drove in, &amp; I said to them "please don't kill anyone here today", but  they did.&#160; They walked into the killing mill &amp; they didn't come out until  over 2 hours later &amp; she was slumped down in the front seat of the bright  blue truck, going nowhere.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Rob was stationed at the brick&#160;side of&#160;Planned  Parenthood &amp; Martha &amp; I were at the side where the very high bushes  are.&#160;It's getting harder to see the parking lot &amp; to get our message to the  people, through the&#160;tall evergreen bushes.&#160; But God is everywhere, so He isn't  restricted&#160;by bushes &amp; bricks.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul passed buy us &amp; showed us that he had a  sandwich from Wendy's for us.&#160; I said that I was going into the center to eat my  hamburger real fast &amp; I'll come right back outside.&#160; I wish I didn't have to  eat but I get a faintly feeling when I'm out on the front lines so&#160;Martha &amp;  I &#160;take turns going into the center to eat a fast lunch.&#160; But not always.&#160;  Martha has to leave to go to the nursing service to sign something &amp; she'll  be gone for about 45 minutes, so I thought that I should go first so that she  could eat her sandwich &amp; go to the nursing service &amp; then come back  again.&#160; I went into the center &amp; the doorbell didn't stop ringing.&#160; I gave a  pregnant mom who is due next month some new baby boy clothes &amp; I asked her  friend to fill out our Intake Sheet so that we can check her progress, she is  due next month with a baby girl.&#160; In the Material Aid Room there was a man &amp;  a young girl getting things &amp; he mentioned that he is being visited by  spirits when he watches his scary movies.&#160; He said the when he watches these  movies the door to the bathroom opens &amp; closes.&#160;&#160; I said "stop watching  those scary movies because you're inviting evil spirits into your home".&#160; I then  mentioned that he might want to call a priest to come&#160;to his house for an  exorcism.&#160; Just a suggestion!&#160; &#160;I wolfed down my hamburger &amp; ice tea &amp;  answered the doorbell once more.&#160; There was two young girls wanting a pregnancy  test.&#160; I ask them to follow me to the counseling room, then I turned around to  see Suzanne, coming into the center.&#160; She took over the pregnancy test for me.&#160;  I then went to see Elroy our past accountant &amp; asked him how it was going  with the 990 Form completion.&#160; He said that it will be done on Tuesday &amp; it  doesn't require my signature.&#160; I said "thank you sir".&#160; I went back outside to  join the others.&#160;&#160; I saw that Dan, Addison &amp; Adolf were now joining Bill,  across the street.&#160; Martha said that she will go &amp; get what she needs to get  done &amp; then come back &amp; eat her lunch.&#160; It sounds like a plan Martha for  I have Rob across the way to assist me in calling&#160;out to the people going into  the abortion mill.</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The two young girls who just had the pregnancy test  was now walking towards me on the sidewalk.&#160; I stopped them I introduced myself  to them as the director of the Focus Pregnancy Center.&#160; I asked what was the  results of the pregnancy test.&#160; The girl who had the test said "negative".&#160; I  said "okay then, stop having sex &amp; behave yourself"&#160; She giggled.&#160; Then I  said for her to pull up her blouse so that no one should see her breast.&#160; She  did.&#160; Then they told me that they were going to Planned Parenthood for an STD  test.&#160; I guided then to go to Embracing Options Pregnancy Center for  testing.&#160;&#160;The way I did it was to tell them that they would be 'dancing with the  devil ' if they go in to Planned Parenthood, which was true.&#160;&#160;Then &amp; the one  girl said that she didn't wan to dance with devil.&#160; I agreed that this was a  wise decision &amp; they took the information that I gave them of the address  &amp; off they went to get tested.&#160; Thank you Lord for getting them away from  this evil place, where the devil lurks for his victims, to ruin their lives.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked up the street &amp;

You go girl!!!&#160; No police were called for  that would bring bad publicity to his re election bid.&#160; While I was talking to  her, near the Buckpitt building, some one hollered out the car window, as they  were driving by to&#160;"get off the phone"!&#160; I was wondering why that bothered  anyone that I was on the phone?&#160; Go figure!&#160; I told Pat that I was on the front  lines &amp; that I would talk to her another time soon.&#160; She said "okay &amp;

The  woman walked into Planned Parenthood &amp; the older man stayed outside.&#160; He  finally walked over to where I was standing &amp; professed that he agreed with  us &amp; that abortion was&#160;wrong &amp; that the Lord will take care of these  people some day if they don't repent.&#160; I was upset with him that he came here at  all.&#160; e said that he brought his wife here for she's an interpreter.&#160; I said "I  wish that she just&#160;said "no", for they are killing little babies in there right  now.&#160; He wasn't happy being&#160;here.&#160; When they came out of the&#160;parking&#160;I waved at  them &amp; they both waved back at me.&#160; I was pretty hard on this&#160;man that was  Chinese about being here today.&#160;&#160;I am so angry when I 'm on the front lines.&#160;  Lord have mercy on me!&#160;&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A car pulled into the parking lot &amp;&#160;a man &amp;  a woman got out of the car.&#160; I told then&#160;that they were killing babies in  there&#160;&amp; if they were planning to please don't.&#160; The&#160;guy said to me "oh no,  I'm a Christian &amp; I don't believe in that, we hear for insurance".&#160; I called  over to him saying that the place just passed this yellow building, meaning  Focus,&#160;could help you but the female started walking into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I  was so upset that more Christians were compromising too.&#160; I try not to be self  righteous or judgmental I just want people that profess to be Christians to act  like Christians.&#160; We're different!!&#160; We have the Lord!!&#160; He will guide you in  what you need &amp; you don't need Planed Parenthood, which is murdering His  precious babies.&#160; I know that we fail &amp; disappoint the Lord &amp; I do  regularly so I hope today that these fine people won't again &amp; that they  learned from their mistake in going into Planned Parenthood for anything.&#160; When  this young couple came out&#160; I landed in on them like lightening &amp; showed  them a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.&#160; The young man who was on the  passenger&#160;side looked a the picture.&#160; She seemed to be the control person in the  relationship.&#160; Not good!!&#160; He needs to be a man &amp; protect her &amp; she  should be lead by him &amp; not the other way around, for the man is suppose to  protect the woman, by his decisions.&#160; When will we turn things around the right  way the way that God deemed it to be.&#160; Come on ladies are you really happy by  taking over the role of man???&#160; Just be a loving woman &amp; respect your man  &amp; let him be the man &amp; you're be happy.&#160; Darn that 'women's lib', which  ruined everything!!!!!!!&#160;

She said that she will stop by again for  a longer time before she goes back to Liberty University to study law.&#160; She's  going into her second year &amp; has one more year after that &amp; she will  then take her Bar Exam &amp;

I'm glad that  we're busy at the center but we're also needed out on the front lines too but we  can't be in both places at the same time.&#160; I wish we had more people to help  us!!&#160; Maybe someday we will either have enough people out on the front lines,  while&#160;Martha &amp; I are&#160;in the center, or enough people, at the center, so&#160;we  could go out to the front lines.&#160; Either way.&#160; I came out of the church &amp;  was approached by a gentleman who has been to our pro life activities at Focus  in the past.&#160; He handed me an envelop with a check for $100 for the pregnancy  center.&#160; Wow!!&#160; Thank you Lord, what a nice surprise.&#160; He said that he also  offers his truck to help people who need a large vehicle for moving.&#160; Great :)&#160;  I then went to Focus to work in the center with Martha &amp; Karen.&#160; When Karen  came in she brought a big box of diapers with her which is always a good thing.&#160;  I asked if she wanted to call the clients or do some work in the Material Aid  Room, it was up to her.&#160; We were so busy &amp; that's a good thing.&#160; The  doorbell rang &amp; Karen answered the door &amp; then went into the Counseling  Room with a client, so I knew that she was going to do a pregnancy test.&#160; It  turned out that she had been raped, not to long ago, so I went in to speak with  her, for I am a rape survivor.&#160; I told her that she was not alone.&#160; She is now  living with a mentally &amp; emotionally abusive man that she just met.&#160; She is  trying to get away from him &amp; we are trying to help her do just that.&#160; I  gave her lots of information &amp; I hope that this will help her start a 'new'  life.&#160;</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Karen had to leave while I was still counseling our  client so I didn't have a chance to say "good bye" to her.&#160;

She  just had another baby by him.&#160;&#160;"What"!, I said. &#160;She said that she was in Dansvile, in a shelter, (I had given her  money to get onto a bus, about 3 weeks ago) there with her children but had to  come back to Rochester to go to court.&#160; He had changed the locks to their rental  apartment &amp; the police were in the Planned Parenthood parking lot waiting  for her.&#160; "What", I said "why aren't they parking in our parking lot"?&#160; She  briefly showed me the court paper (I didn't look to closely at it) &amp; said  that she was going back to the shelter &amp; will be coming back in August to go  to court again.&#160; She had no money to get there today so I gave her more money.&#160;  She went into the Material Aid Room to get some clothes for her children &amp;  off she went.&#160; At that point I wasn't suspicious but a couple of days later I  was.&#160; Live &amp; Learn,&#160;that's my motto.&#160;

The doorbell rang again &amp; again.&#160; Some of  the people who came in were regular's &amp; some were not.&#160; We try to limit our  clients to once a month, unless there is a urgent need in their home.&#160;&#160;This rule  is&#160;not well enforced.&#160;</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Martha &amp;

We try to teach abstinence &amp; the waiting to get married to  have sex.&#160; That's how God wants it &amp; we follow His rules to the tee.&#160; we are  'seed planters', hoping that the teaching that we give our girls will take hold  &amp;

in bad times.&#160; That's how it is suppose to be.&#160;&#160;But what has  happened, in today's society, where anything goes: Abortion, STD's,&#160; Suicide,  &amp; Drug &amp; Alcohol abuse, to numb the emotional pain??????&#160;

I said to her "I thought that you went  back to Dansville yesterday"?&#160; She said that she had to comeback for a doctors  appointment which she failed to mention yesterday when she was in the center.&#160; I  quickly mentioned to her that I don't&#160;have any more money.&#160; She said I wanted  you see my kids pictures &amp; she handed me the pictures of two&#160;darling  children.&#160; Her 2 year old son &amp; her daughter that was born only months ago  &amp; was in the hospital for awhile too.&#160; She&#160;said that she was headed to the  Alternatives of Battered Women (ABW) &amp; I said if you need us again just stop  by.&#160;

Time will tell. &#160;I then opened up the center &amp; started to put things  away &amp; to get ready for anyone to come to get assistance.&#160;Then I looked  up&#160;at the ceiling to see that my office &amp; the Green Room &amp; the Great  Room all had water stains.&#160; I picked up the phone to call our landlord Bernie.&#160;  I told him what was going on &amp; he&#160;said that he'll be over in an hour to&#160;look  at the problem.&#160; I said "okay" &amp; hung up.&#160; I was upset because I'm so  sick&#160;of water problems, in the center, to say the least.&#160; I&#160; went to the  kitchenette to eat a quick lunch so I won't faint.&#160; I was working in the office  when the door bell rang.&#160; I greeted some people who were there for baby &amp;  children clothes &amp; of course diapers.&#160; Then I ministered to a woman with her  child &amp; her uncle to get some things.&#160; We got talking to find out that the  ex boyfriend &amp; the father of the little boy was abusive.&#160; He had been in  jail but didn't learn his lesson.&#160;He sometimes goes to his mother's house for  acceptance.&#160;I suggested that he stay there for he tried to break into my clients  apartment. &#160;He doesn't work because if he does he'd have to take care of his two  children, one by&#160;our client&#160;&amp; the other by a woman who lives in Buffalo.&#160; He  is a dead beat Dad.&#160; I suggested that she gets advice from our Domestic Abuse  Adviser &amp; her husband, who is a former Judge.&#160; I called Pat &amp; gave our  client the phone to talk to her &amp; to make an appointment with her.&#160; The  appointment was&#160;made for&#160; early next week at Focus.&#160; I felt good about this  appointment because her &amp;

I also spoke to two women who called me on my cell phone.&#160; One was  about a Focus fund-raiser project &amp; the other was a private conversation.&#160; I  suggested that she goes to the media, with the information, that she  discovered.&#160; I sure hope that she does.&#160; She asked me not to&#160;talk about it, so I  won't.&#160; Then Martha said that she had to take the boys back home to get ready  for a Soccer game.&#160; I said "good bye" to them &amp; thanked them for all their  hard work.&#160; They just smiled at me.&#160; Martha said that she will come back later.&#160;  I said "that'll be great", &amp; off they went.&#160; It was about 3:45pm now &amp;  there comes Paul through the door.&#160; I said "what, it's so good to see you  Paul"!&#160; He said that he could help out until 4:30 but stayed until 6:15.&#160; Yeah!&#160;  The doorbell rang &amp; Paul answered the door &amp; helped the people out in  the Material Aid Room by giving them diapers.&#160; Then I heard him say "I'll go get  Mary &amp; she can give you a pregnancy test".&#160; I got up from my seat &amp;  looked at my desk which was piled up with papers &amp; started to go into the  hallway &amp; greeted my new client with a smile.&#160; I introduced myself to her  &amp; lead her into the Rose Counseling Room, a very peaceful room, which the  girls like a lot.&#160; I gave her the test &amp; it was negative &amp; I did some  teaching with her.&#160; Her young son had a lot of energy &amp; was throwing my  things onto the floor.&#160; Then he quieted down a bit.&#160; Thank God.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>After she left my cell phone rang &amp; it was  Martha saying that she was at home &amp; wanted to stay there because she was  tired.&#160; I asked her if she could get some coffee &amp; come back to the center  for I needed her, which is always.&#160; Poor baby!&#160; &#160;About an hour later she came back to the center, I was happy.&#160; I was  expecting Bernie which showed up about 15 minutes later.&#160; He fixed the ceilings,  which I was happy about then he told me the news plans.&#160; He said that the owner  of the restaurant across the street, Gibb 54,&#160;was leasing the former Ethiopian  Restaurant so that he could fix up the front of our building in the small strip  mall.&#160; He will probably sell the whole building to him in 5 years but now he was  still the owner of the property.&#160; Sounds good to us Bernie.&#160; The front of the  building will be made new &amp; the parking lot will be paved, to be only one  level, instead of&#160;the two scoops that I usually fall into, going into the  center.&#160; When it rains it holds water &amp; turns into a pool, ducks could swim  in.&#160; Not good&#160; for adults :(&#160;&#160; Martha &amp; I were happy about any improvements  to the building, that Focus has been in, for&#160;seven years now.&#160;

I have been on the front lines in  front of this hell hole since 1986 &amp; I never saw such a close call.&#160; Thank  you Lord that there wasn't any accident here today.&#160; They are not ready to meet  you face to face.&#160; It was heart rendering to see this family come into the  abortion mill, headed by the mother, to have this precious baby murdered in cold  blood here this afternoon.&#160; A family affair.

it  was Suzanne calling to tell me that she was on her way.&#160; Okay Suzanne.&#160; When she  arrived I told about a couple of things.&#160; I had just called our client asking if  she was planning to came back to Focus for a repeat pregnancy test &amp; gave  her my number to call if she has any questions.&#160; I showed Suzanne the chart, on  the desk,&#160;just in case she does come she'll have the information about the  client. &#160;We spoke about some other things when all of a sudden Paul stated that  he had lost his car keys.&#160; He had to walk to a greasy spoon&#160;diner,&#160;down the  street, for his lunch &amp; my hamburger.&#160; I hope I don't&#160;die.&#160; I prayed to St.  Anthony, the Patron of lost items, for him to find Paul's keys.&#160;

He mentioned that what we were doing out here, by  showing the graphic signs &amp; all, could be hurtful to the woman who had a  miscarriage.&#160; I said that I was sorry if it hurt&#160;her in any way but it wasn't  the same thing, for having a miscarriage the woman is&#160;not at&#160;fault for the loss  of her baby but in an abortion she is responsible&#160;for taking the baby's life, in  a cruel &amp; inhumane way.&#160; I said that I had an miscarriage years ago &amp;  I'm right out on the front lines with the graphic pictures, which break my heart  when I look at them for they suffered so much before they died.&#160; He then said  that he was 'poor life'.&#160; I said "that's great so why don't you come back next  Thursday &amp; help save some lives".&#160; I did say that Planned Parenthood is  racist &amp; there is Black Genocide going on.&#160; We are all whit out her &amp;  where are all the Black people trying to save their race from being killed off  by Planned Parenthood????&#160; He hemmed &amp; hauled, so I don't know if we'll see  him next week on the front lines, or not.&#160;

He said that he had already had a child &amp; was 19 years old.&#160;  I said for him to get away from my because he was a murder.&#160; I walked backwards  to get away from him on the sidewalk.&#160; Adolf who was standing across the street  came over to where I was, to protect me.&#160; I then said to the young man, for I  wanted his soul saved.&#160; "Why did you do this, you are an accessory to murder for  you brought her here to have your baby killed".&#160; He said again "I already have a  child".&#160; I said "you have two children &amp; one you had killed".&#160; He then said  that the girlfriend wanted it &amp; there was nothing he could do.&#160; I said "yea  there was you could have tried to talk her out of it, you're the man, for you're  suppose to protect women &amp; children &amp; you shouldn't have driven her  here.&#160; Then I offered him the literature packet &amp; she told me that the guy  over there had given him one.&#160; Then Adolf spoke to him &amp; I backed away.&#160;

They were on a gray strap &amp; they were hanging on the  gate.&#160; He must have dropped them earlier, when he was out on the front lines  with Sheila,&#160;&amp; someone must have found them on the ground &amp;

the literature box.&#160; Well God had plans.&#160; When I  arrived back to the front lines there was the neighbor who lives down the street  &amp; has called the police on us at times&#160;about the&#160;noise.&#160; We use the mega  phone,&#160;which is under the Federal Injunction, for us to use,&#160;to call out to the  people going into the abortion mill.&#160; I looked at him &amp; said "thank you for  watching over my things while I went to the center to give Paul his keys that  the man next door just found".&#160; He just looked at me &amp; he said "your sign  blew into the street so I went &amp; got it".&#160; I said "oh thank you so very  much, how kind of you".&#160; I was given the grace from God to talk to him without  any animosity or anger towards him but with gentleness &amp; love.&#160; I said to  him "my name is Mary" &amp; he said back to me "I know".&#160; I wished that I asked  him his name, hopefully at another time.&#160; We talked for about 10 minutes.&#160; I  said to him that he &amp; the rest of the neighborhood is missing out on many  graces by not being here on the front lines with us &amp; I said "not one of  you&#160;neighbors, in all the years that our pregnancy center has been open, did any  of you come to&#160;our door to give us baby clothes, baby formula &amp; diapers, for  our mothers".&#160; What a shame is that.&#160; He then mentioned that will be be closing  soon because the owner of the restaurant is taking over to make a Party House.&#160;  I set him sraight &amp; I was very happy that Bernnie, our landlord had told me  waht was going on the day before, so I had the correct infromation fro him &amp;  for Jim who he mentioned.&#160; Then he said "you don't like Jim".&#160; I replied back to  him saying that I don't dislike Jim, I just wish that he will leave us alone,  that's all.&#160; The m he daid that he doesn't have any problem with us (prolifers)  or Planned Parenthood.&#160; "What"!&#160; I said back to him, "they kill little babies in  there &amp; you should have a problem with them, they killl peope in there"!!&#160;  An unborn fetus, baby, whateveryou want to say, is a person.&#160; You were in your  mother's womb's &amp; you were a person just a small person compared to what you  look like today!&#160;&#160; We went on a little more then he said that he had to go to  supper.&#160;

Isaid back to him "yes you can" to give him some support  but in my heart I knew that he was right.&#160; The woman has all the powere&#160; &amp;  not the man.&#160; He drove on in the parking lot &amp; parked his car.&#160; When he got  out of the car he went over to the other side of the car &amp; then I say that  he was hilding a young child.&#160; My heart ached frohim &amp; for this child &amp;  for the child that was being killed in there....his child.&#160; What pain &amp;  heartache will he have to endure &amp; so will this young child.&#160; Martha came  back outside to get more things &amp;

light emerges with her holding a skull.&#160; A  white angel is above her &amp; a black angel is below her.&#160; Say what!!&#160; How  offensive this is to those who are going to church, two doors down the street.&#160;  Also, to my Pastor of Our Lady of Victory Church/ St. Joseph.&#160; Lord have  Mercy!!&#160;&#160; Martha &amp; I went over to the men who were standing there by&#160; the  building to come to find out they were the workers of the building.&#160; They agreed  that this was unexceptable &amp; they are notifying the owner of the building  who is away at this time.&#160; The second in charge is upset &amp; so are the  renters of the building.&#160;I had called the Mayor's office yesterday &amp; I was  told to call Mr.Holahan.&#160; He called me&#160;back today. &#160;I spoke to the Commissioner  of Department of Environmental Services, Mr. Holahan, &amp;.he said that this  was not a city&#160;issue but a private property issue.&#160; The city can't do anything  about this offense.&#160; He was very nice.&#160; I wrote a blurb to ask people to call  the owners of the building to take this off of their building or to cover this  woman's breast.&#160; We'll see!&#160;</span></span><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I went to the center to start our  work.&#160; We were blessed with a big check which made our rent for August.&#160; Thank  you Lord!&#160; The doorbell rang, rang &amp; rang some more.&#160; I had to go to the  bank to deposit the check at the bank downtown but I didn't want to go because  we were so busy &amp; I didn't want to leave Martha alone with all the people  that were coming into the center.&#160; I think that from 1pm to 2pm we saw at&#160;least  14 people, for clothes &amp; diapers.&#160; But I had to go to the bank.&#160; Our  landlord was on the roof with his helper trying to patch up the areas that are  leaking into our center.&#160;I was happy about that but&#160;I thought that I was through  with this water problem.&#160; As long as it rains we're in trouble, with this flat  roof.&#160; I didn't know what lied ahead of us&#160;this afternoon&#160; :(&#160;&#160; When I returned  from the bank I saw our landlord &amp; asked him to come in to see the new leaks  &amp; I would write him a check for the rent for August.&#160; He followed me into  the center.&#160; I showed him the new problems &amp; he measured the titles, on the  ceiling,&#160;so that he could go back on the&#160;roof to patch it up.&#160; Yea!!&#160; I wrote  out a check for $1,1800 for our rent for August.&#160; Thank God that we made our  rent again.&#160; God is Great all the time.&#160; &#160;Bernie left &amp; Martha &amp; I had a  quick lunch &amp; the doorbell rang again.&#160; Martha was sneezing &amp; she thinks  that she has a summer cold, oh no!&#160; She looked pale &amp; wasn't feeling to good  either.&#160; I gave her some Cold Eze lozenges with Zinc in it to help her get  better.&#160; Poor baby :(&#160;&#160;&#160; She was working in the kitchenette cleaning our toys  that we received from donations &amp; I&#160; was making the diaper bags up &amp; all  of a sudden&#160; I yelled out, Hi Paul!!&#160; Martha quickly tuned around to see Paul  who had just come in to help us.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; He likes to do the cleaning so Martha  gave him the job.&#160; I continued to do my work with all the intentions of doing my  office work next.&#160; If you want to make God laugh just tell Him your plans.&#160; Oh  yeah!&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was Valerie our regular client.&#160; She told us  all her good news that she was given a washer, a refrigerator &amp; a stove but  she had no way of getting these things to her house.&#160; There's where I came in to  her rescue.&#160; I called Mark who blessed us at Focus with a &amp;100 check two  weeks ago &amp; he said that he has a truck &amp; can help people move things.&#160;  "Great" I said to him, hoping that someday I could use his services, well today  was the day.&#160; I called him &amp; then I gave Valerie the phone &amp; they made  arrangements, along with Paul, to help Valerie get&#160;these&#160;items tomorrow  morning.&#160; How wonderful was this :)&#160;&#160; We were all happy.&#160; Then the doorbell rang  &amp; it was a woman who needed referrals to help her &amp; her 4 children.&#160; I  gave her the referral list &amp; Martha gave her the phone &amp; she called the  Catholic Family Center, down the street to assist her with food &amp; shelter.&#160;  She was happy &amp; so were we.&#160; I love it when plan comes together.&#160; Well you'd  like all was well &amp; we were having a good day, we were until now.&#160; The rains  came down so fast &amp; furious that we were in a quandary.&#160; It was so  unexpected.&#160; The we hear the familiar sound of the toilet gurgling which sent  terror down my spine.&#160; The noise I never wanted to hear again after our flood in  2011.&#160; I walked over to the bathroom to see that the toilet was about to  overflow.&#160; I called for Martha, Paul &amp; Valerie to set up a dam effect to  protect the water from entering the Great Room.&#160; We grabbed some towels, winter  clothes, summer clothes &amp; put it on the floor by the hallway but to no avail  the water came streaming over the toilet &amp; onto the bathroom floor &amp;  into the hall closet &amp; up the hallway to the Great Room.&#160; I put a bucket in  the bathroom where the pipe was leaking, I think that helped a little.&#160; I  quickly called Bernie &amp; told him of the current problem &amp; told him to  bring the water vacuum with him.&#160; He just got home &amp; said that he will come  right back to the center.&#160; Good.&#160; It wasn't his fault that this happened it was  just to much rain coming down in such a short time that caused the problem.&#160;  Paul brought Valerie home so it was Martha &amp; I at the helm.&#160; Bernie walked  in about 20 minutes later to take care of the water rug problem.&#160; In the  meantime I went to the hall closet &amp; picked up the box on the floor &amp; it  burst open &amp; my shoes got drenched, with toilet water.&#160; Ick!!&#160; I couldn't  cry until Bernie got there &amp; he said "Mary I'll take care of this problem".&#160;  So I asked him for $10 to reimburse&#160;us for the paper towels that I lost in the  flood, which were on the floor in the hall closet.&#160; He was so nice to do so, for  he didn't want more water (tears), on the floor.&#160; I asked him about putting down  titles on the floor of the Great Room &amp; he said "yes that's a good idea".&#160;  But later on he clarified that he meant the hallway &amp; the two bathrooms not  the Great Room, though he did say that he would get the carpet cleaned.&#160; Things  are looking up!!&#160; I always ask God to turn an evil or misfortune into good  &amp; He is.&#160; Thank you Lord :)&#160; Bernie did as much as he could do &amp; said  "good bye".&#160; After he left Martha &amp; I had supper &amp; talked &amp; talked  &amp; talked some more.&#160; She had to go home for she needed her sleep.&#160; I stayed  &amp; did office work until I went home around 9:30pm to get cleaned up &amp; to  watch the Olympics.&#160; A glass of wine won't hurt.&#160;&#160;</span><div><strong>&#160;</strong></div><hr /><strong> </strong><p>&#160;</p><div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wednesday, August 1, 2012 at Focus</span></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Or dear Martha is suffering with a summer cold &amp;  she is such a trooper she shows up at the center when she should be in bed,  drinking lots of fluids.&#160; Usually Wednesdays are not as busy as Tuesdays but  today we were so busy.&#160; Busy is okay but the phone I received in the office was  very upsetting.&#160; I've only received about 4 of them but I want to they to save  lives where I am.&#160; I answered the office phone which not to many people call me  on it but it is in the phone book so I do get some legitimate calls.&#160; I said  "hello this is Mary" &amp; the young voice on the other end said "do you know of  any places that do abortions"?&#160;&#160;I answered back to her saying "we don't do  abortions for we are a pregnancy center that helps pregnant moms with diaper,  formula, car seats &amp; the like &amp; we don't give out information to anyone  to have their baby killed"&#160; I went on to say that the baby has a heartbeat &amp;  feels pain &amp; you'd be post abortive&#160;for the rest of your life for murdering  your&#160;baby, which is a serious sin".&#160; Then she had the nerve to&#160;ask me who does  do abortions.&#160; I answered back that I would not give her any place to go to have  her baby killed.&#160; Then she&#160;said "I'm not pregnant but I&#160;don't like the way you  talked to me" &amp; hung up.&#160; But before she did I said to her quickly, "the  reason is because we care about you".&#160; I told Martha what had happened &amp; she  called her back &amp; left a nice message on her phone saying that we were  praying for her &amp; for her baby &amp; for her not to kill her baby &amp; that  we can help her &amp; she gave her my cell number to call me.&#160; She did &amp; she  left a message saying that she didn't like what I had said &amp; it was her body  &amp; are we going to take care of the child after he&#160;was born &amp; when he  gets older"?&#160; She is out of touch with reality.&#160; I hope that what we said will  resonates with her soul.&#160; I'm not sure if she was calling for herself or for  someone else or this was a prank call &amp; she was surprised with the  response&#160;I gave her.&#160; I only told her the truth &amp; some people can't handle  the truth.&#160; Lord have mercy!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell wouldn't stop ringing &amp; the phone  wouldn't stop ringing either.&#160; What a day!!&#160; I answered the doorbell &amp; there  were two girls standing there asking for pregnancy tests &amp; that they needed  a letter stating that they were pregnant.&#160; The one girl already knew that she  was pregnant but the other girl did not.&#160; They were not together but came at the  same time.&#160; The center was still a mess &amp; a little smelly from the rain  overflow from yesterday but what could I do &amp; didn't have time to do  anything because the phone &amp; doorbell kept me so busy that&#160;I had no time to  clean up.&#160; I did put in air freshners in the electric outlets so&#160;I do hope that  helped.&#160; As I was assisting these two girls our friends from St. Pius the Tenth  Church came with all the food donations.&#160; It was a busy time.&#160; I lead the one  girl, that didn't know if she was so pregnant, into the counseling room first  &amp; the other young girl in to the smelly Green Room to wait her turn.&#160; Her  two sisters came in to use the bathroom &amp; then left to go back outside.&#160; I  asked Martha if she would do the first pregnancy test &amp; she did .&#160; The test  was negative &amp; she was given some brochures&#160;for educational purposes to  'start over'.&#160; I said to her, as she was leaving the counseling room,&#160;"no sex  until marriage", which I'm sure that Martha had also told her, after the test  results.&#160; She then went into the Material Aid Room to get some things for her  niece.&#160; I went into the room to clean up &amp; then I called my client into the  room to fill out the Intake Sheet.&#160; The test was positive.&#160; I asked her&#160;if she  had a doctor &amp; she said "yes".&#160; Then she went on to say that she had a  pregnancy test in is office at Strong &amp; it was positive &amp; he asked her  if she wanted an abortion &amp; she said "no" &amp; he said that she needed to  repeat the test &amp; to give him a confirmation of the results.&#160; There is where  Focus came into play.&#160; I suggested for her to have an ultrasound of her baby on  August 8th at 2pm at HIS Branches right next to the pregnancy center Embracing  Options.&#160; I then suggested that she has Dr. Morehouse for her prenatal  physician.&#160; She agreed.&#160; What is the matter with the so called doctor&#160;that she  went to at Strong Memorial Hospital??&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I received several call from a mom who was  referred&#160; to us by the Salvation Army, which many of our clients are.&#160; She  needed to know what we offer &amp; to get directions for her husband, for he was  the one who would be coming to get the diapers &amp; all.&#160; I gave her the  information &amp; she said that he was on his way.&#160; About an hour later he  arrived.&#160; He was walking which surprised me for she had asked for directions but  he was taking the bus &amp; he needed to know where to go once he got off the  bus.&#160; I felt badly for him because he wanted food too, which we just&#160; received  from the good people of St. Pius the Tenth Church.&#160; He had quite a selection but  he had to carry the heavy bags on the bus.&#160; He was strong, thank God.&#160; He went  into the Great Room to get the food &amp; I gave him diapers &amp; he also took  some clothes in the Material Aid Room too.&#160; Then he told me his story.&#160; He has  two children from a past relationship &amp; his new wife has two children from a  previous relationship &amp; they have a daughter from their marriage.&#160; He was  walking because he lost his license&#160; because of a DWI offense.&#160; He goes to AA  (alcoholic anonymous) &amp; to other support groups to get back on tract.&#160; He  had broken both of his legs in a alcohol related accident but has recoved but  not without the side effects of some pain.&#160; I saw his heart through his eyes  &amp; saw that he was&#160;trying very hard to change &amp; to take care of his  family.&#160; His &amp; his wife &amp; baby live with her parents but they want their  house&#160;back.&#160; All their childen don't life with them but so come to visit with  stay overs.&#160; It's so sad to see another dysfunctional family that the children  suffer but at least they're trying to care from them which I admire.&#160; He wasn't  a 'dead beat dad'&#160;which was good to see for a change.&#160; He left with two big bags  filled with food &amp; things.&#160; Best to you Steve !!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#160;</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thursday, August 2, 2012 on the Front  Lines</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span> <br /><div><span style="font-size: medium;">I was having car trouble, so my friend Linda  followed me to the center, so if&#160;my&#160;broke down, she'd be there to help me.&#160; Such  a good friend :)&#160; So I arrived at the center about 45 minutes early.&#160; I went in  &amp; did some things to get ready for my shift at 1pm.&#160; I saw that Paul wasn't  there so I knew that I would have to bring out the signs, the literature box  &amp; chairs.&#160; I did ask the guys at the Taxi Co. to help me &amp; they did.&#160;  Thanks guys.&#160; Rob, the sidewalk counselor &amp; prayer warrior, was going to be  a little late today &amp; leave at 4pm.&#160; I had that in my mind.&#160; Martha was sick  with probably bronchitis &amp; a sinus infection, so I wondered if she was  coming at all, though she usually calls me if she's not &amp;b I received no  call as yet.&#160; She is a trooper !!&#160; When I arrived out on the sidewalk I greeted  both Sheila &amp; her brother Dennis, who lives in Texas.&#160; He's here for a visit  for about a month.&#160; Yeah!&#160; When they left I was alone&#160;but a few minutes later  our oldest pro lifer Bill, who will be 83 years old on September 25.&#160; You Go  Bill....&#160; He sits across the street of the Killing Mill, while I stand on the  same side of the Killing Mill.&#160; I call out to the people,&#160;while they come into  the parking lot &amp; as they get out of their car &amp; walk to the door,  offering them help.&#160;&#160; It was about 15 minutes later Rob came to join me&#160;to  sidewalk counsel.&#160; Martha came a little while later, for she called me on my  cell phone, saying that she couldn't find her keys.&#160; A prayer to St. Anthony  went up to Heaven immediately.&#160; She was on the sidewalk about 20 minuets later.&#160;  Thank you St. Anthony. <br /></span></div></div><div>&#160;<br /><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha just got onto the sidewalk when I spoke to a  woman with a young girl around 8 years old getting into the car in the parking  lot.&#160; I called to the mom &amp; said to her that it was sad that she brought her  daughter to this abortion mill.&#160; As she was coming out of the parking lot she  slowed down to where I was standing with Martha.&#160; She hollered over to me saying  :"what did you say about my daughter, you blank"?&#160; I said "I said that it was a  shame that you brought your daughter to this place where they kill children".&#160;  She replied "you blank".&#160; I'm not going to repeat what she said to me.&#160; Then I  hollered back to her to watch her dirty mouth &amp; she sped away.&#160; Poor little  girl she deserves a mother with a nice tongue.&#160; As her mother &amp; I were  talking she just looked at the pictures out on the sidewalk.&#160; I hope that her  mother can explain to her why she was in such a place?? <br /></span></div></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; Rob was on the sidewalk counseling  &amp; the usual guys were across the street praying I decided to go into the  center.&#160; Paul wasn't there this afternoon to help out &amp; I was waiting for  Suzanne to take over in the center, she was running late.&#160; When she arrived I  was eating a sandwich &amp; we talked for about 10 minutes before I went back  outside to join the team.&#160; I'm burning out so I wanted to pace myself out on the  front lines while we have Rob until he starts&#160; teaching this fall again.&#160; It's  so hard to see the cars going out after they have killed their  baby.&#160;</span></div></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Debbie arrived to be with me on the front lines,  &amp; then&#160;was going to propose&#160;,a Focus fund-raiser, at our meeting at 7pm.&#160;I  greeted her &amp; we talked for a few minutes.&#160;&#160;Then&#160;a young couple were getting into their car when I called over to them  saying "I hope that you didn't have your baby killed here today".&#160; "What did you  say, I can't hear you", she replied back.&#160; So I said it again &amp; she repeated  what she had first said.&#160; I was using my normal voice &amp; not the mega phone  but I knew that I was calling out loud &amp; clear enough &amp; there wasn't  much street traffic at that time either, for her to hear me .&#160; I heard her  okay.&#160; When they drove to the exit I just stood there with the graphic sign of  the aborted baby.&#160; They had to see it.&#160; I said to them again "I hope that you  didn't have your baby killed".&#160; She looked over at me &amp; wiggled her tongue.&#160;  What was that?&#160; What a mess she is.&#160; As they passed by me I said "get a hearing  aid &amp;&#160;I hope that you repent".&#160; </span></div></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I heard my name called.&#160; Someone was saying  'Mary' real loudly.&#160; I turned around thinking it was Martha but she wasn't there  so I looked up the street to see the neighbors on their porch on Whalen St..&#160; I  decided to go over there to talk to the woman &amp; try to make peace with her.&#160;  It was a very painful encounter &amp; I walked away.&#160; I looked into her blank  eyes &amp; just felt sorry for her.&#160; I will pray for her some more.&#160; Debbie was  nice enough to put the signs in the center &amp; when I went back over across  the street I saw that a young woman was sitting on the bench in front of Planned  Parenthood. I said to her that this wasn't a park &amp; they don't care about  you.&#160; She called back to me saying "I know".&#160; Now I was on the sidewalk at my  regular spot.&#160; I talked to her again &amp; said "I hope that you don't have the  Plan B in the bag for it causes abortions".&#160; Then I continued to call her over  to me ,by offering her the last Truth packet, that was in the literature box.  She said that she was okay. Then I said to her that if she comes over to take  the packet it would make my day.&#160; I saw her smile &amp; she walked over to me.&#160;  I smiled to her &amp; she asked if there was any hard pictures on the bag.&#160; I  said "no" then remembered that there was one piece of literature that did have a  graphic picture in it.&#160; I said "yes" I then took out the brochure &amp; then  handed her the packet.&#160; She tanked me &amp; then smiled.&#160; I also gave her our  brochure along with the packet.&#160; I said "thanks &amp; have a good day".&#160; She  said "thanks, you too" &amp; walked back to the bench waiting for her ride.&#160; I  brought the literature box into the center, for Debbie had brought everything  else in earlier.&#160; I saw that Suzanne was still there, which I was well pleased,  for she was calling the clients.&#160; Debbie was nice enough to order 2 large pizzas  from Mark's pizzeria. I will never order from them.&#160; Not so good :(&#160; It was a  nice get together of Martha, Debbie, Suzanne &amp; I.&#160; Later on Melissa, our new  volunteer, joined us in our all girl get together.&#160; We had fun &amp; great  conversation, even though we didn't&#160;have great food.&#160; I could have been the only  one that didn't like the pizza &amp; I made no mention of it to the girls.&#160;  After supper Suzanne had to go home to&#160;cut&#160;her grass,&#160;for it was about 6:30pm  now &amp; then Melissa went into the Great Room to get all the stuff out of the  storage rooms for our new shelves on Tuesday.&#160; That left Martha Debbie &amp; I  for our Focus fund raiser meeting.&#160; Taking a chance on the Lottery.&#160;Martha &amp;  &#160;I made the decision to do it for Focus.&#160; Melissa re joined us after the meeting  &amp; then she &amp; Martha left for the night.&#160; Debbie &amp; I continued to  talk &amp; to share our stories about our lives which were quite similar to some  degree :(.&#160; We talked until 1:30am &amp; then went home.&#160; Yeah! my car started.&#160;  I took it to the shop to get an oil change &amp; for the inspection.&#160; I need to  have it repaired on Monday to pass inspection.&#160; Something about the steering  wheel.&#160; The battery is okay now &amp; no lights are on.&#160; Thank God!&#160;</span></div></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div></span><hr /></div><p>&#160;</p><div><div>&#160;<span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Tuesday, August 7, 2012 at Focus<div style="text-align: center;"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="display: none;" id="1344805096714S">&#160;</span><img src="http://www.nationalofficefurniture.com/NOF_DATA/ThumbPath/tmbgbl_h_hiland_7_storage.jpg" title="For office furniture with personality, choose Hiland from National" id="ctl07_ThumbNailControl_ctl21_imgProduct" style="BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px; WIDTH: 175px; BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; HEIGHT: 130px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; CURSOR: pointer" alt="" /><span style="display: none;" id="1344805097111E">&#160;</span> </font></div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><div><div style="text-align: left;">&#160;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Martha  &amp; I arrived at Focus to let the guys in  that were delivering our two new food storage cabinets &amp;&#160;storage room  shelves,&#160;that&#160;Joe &amp;  friends&#160;made for an Eagle Scout project, for the Great  Room.&#160; The  cabinets were so beautiful &amp; so well made.

He said that he would be  their tomorrow at 1pm.&#160; Thanks Frank, that'll  work.&#160; After that I  called our landlord Bernie &amp; asked&#160;him&#160;to come over  &amp; to bring  his wet vac with him for the carpet in the room was wet, thanks   to&#160;Karen our&#160;volunteer, taking off her shoes to test the carpet.&#160; He  said that  he would come over a little later.&#160; Progress is being made.&#160; </span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I  asked Karen what she would like to do in the  center for her 2 hours  that she's with us.&#160; She called one of our clients to  confirm her  appointment with Grace Community Center for her ultrasound  tomorrow.&#160;  She will be there to see the first glimpse of her precious baby.&#160;   Yeah!!&#160; Karen then helped to put away the donations that we were blessed  with in  the Material Aid Room.&#160; We were thankful that she brought us a  big box of  diapers, size 5, our most popular size next to size 4.&#160; We  were very busy &amp;  the doorbell kept on ringing.&#160; Martha did two  pregnancy tests, which were both  negative, &amp; did some teaching  about abstinence&#160;along with handing out the  literature packet.&#160; Paul  came around 3pm &amp; helped us out for about 3 hours,  what a trooper!&#160;</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The  doorbell rang &amp; Martha went t the door to  answer it.&#160; I asked her  who it was &amp; she said that it was Fr.

I  went back to the office when Martha went into the counseling room.&#160; The doorbell  rang &amp; it was the repairman.&#160; After I paid&#160;him &amp; put the new key on my  key chain I was available to assist Martha with the girls.&#160; I really didn't want  to go into the room but I had to.&#160; The girl that had the pregnancy test was  pregnant &amp; was going to keep her baby &amp; not have him or&#160;her killed,  thank God.&#160; I was thrilled.&#160; I talked to her about the 'free' ultrasound that we  have available at the Grace Community Center, on Wednesdays from 2-3:30pm&#160;&amp;  Karen, our volunteer, who is a doctor will do the test.&#160; She&#160; was receptive  &amp; we made the appointment for the test in 2 weeks.&#160; I gave her the  instructions &amp; also the DVD &amp; more literature for pregnant girls.&#160; I  then turned to the other girl who was quiet &amp; said "are you doing fine".&#160;  She just looked at me &amp; didn't say anything then she said "I'm going to have  an abortion".&#160; I quickly said to her "you're not going to kill your baby"!!&#160; I  then went on to talk to her.&#160; I said that your baby will have a Death  Certificate before he or she will have&#160;a Birth Certificate &amp; Planned  Parenthood doesn't care about you.&#160; The other two girls giggled.&#160; I said "what's  so funny".&#160; They said that what I just said sounded funny. "Well", I said "it  isn't very funny for your baby".&#160; I then got their attention once more.&#160; I was  trying to direct my comments to the girl in the room that said that she had an  abortion 3 months ago, to have her snap out of denial of what she's done to her  baby &amp; herself.&#160; Then the girl that was planning to have her baby killed  took out a picture of an ultrasound picture &amp; showed it to Martha, for she  was sitting right next to her.&#160; Martha asked where she had the ultrasound done  &amp; she said that it was done at Compass Care Pregnancy Center, which  surprised &amp; delighted me.&#160; I knew that she got good information from them  about her baby.&#160; Then she said that she didn't want to bring a baby in the world  that she couldn't provide for.&#160; I said just trust in the Lord who created this  precious child.&#160; I said that I was brought up in a middle class home where I was  raped &amp; molested &amp; I'm happy to be alive.&#160; Life is not perfect but when  a life has been created that life should be protected.&#160; I talked a few minutes  more &amp; then the two girls&#160;left to join the person who was giving them a  ride, in the parking lot.&#160; The abortion minded girl stayed for a minute while I  gave her more information. &#160;I gave her a hug &amp; said that we care for her  &amp; will help her in her pregnancy &amp; afterwards.&#160; Martha said that we will  be praying for her. She smiled back at me &amp; left to join her two friends in  the parking lot.&#160; We hope &amp; pray that she will not go to have her baby  killed but will continue her pregnancy.&#160; Hopefully we will find out that she  'choose' life. <br /></span></div></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was a woman, who had  gotten clothes from us at Focus,&#160;returning was bringing a bag full of clothes  back to us, after her child grew out of them.&#160; How nice was that!!&#160;</span></div></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul was there again to help us pick away the  donations.&#160; We assisted many mothers in the Material Aid Room with clothes &amp;  food today.&#160; </span></div></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div>&#160;<span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial"><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong><span style="COLOR: rgb(128,0,128)"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><font face="Arial"><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><span style="COLOR: rgb(128,0,128)"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium">Thursday, August 9, 2012 on the Front  Lines</span></span></div><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><font color="#000000">I just came from Mass at the  Sacred Heart Cathedral,&#160;when I arrived at the center.

she said that she&#160;just had an abortion &amp; wants to go to  confession.&#160; Her husband told her not to have an abortion &amp; she did it  anyway &amp; regretted it immediately.&#160;&#160;Sheila asked me to get her some Natural  Family Planning brochures &amp; I suggested that she also sends her some post  abortion brochures too.&#160; This was a sad case of taking a life &amp; her husband  might even divorce her for this &amp; her family will be ruined.&#160; Her other  children will find out someday that their mother killed their brother or sister,  by abortion.&#160; Survivors guilt &amp; not trusting anyone, will haunt them for the  rest of their lives.&#160; I once was told by a Deacon who was on the Annulment  Tribunal that a lot of the cases for annulments were because of the wife having  an abortion.&#160; I was already upset by this news even before I went out on the  front lines.&#160; Then my cell phone rang &amp; it was Pat, our great grandmother,  telling me that Katherine, her granddaughter, was still not doing well &amp; was  still bleeding, having contractions on Morphine for the pain &amp; it wasn't  working.&#160; She is 23 weeks pregnant&#160;at in Strong Memorial Hospital.&#160; She was not  pleased that they wanted to first abort this precious baby &amp; Pat fought hard  for them not to.&#160;

started to set up the signs &amp; the literature box.&#160;&#160;I was  alone on my side, which bothers me because the cars come driving in &amp; I'm  all alone to do everything in the beginning.&#160; The other pro lifer came &amp; I  was upset with him for nit being on time like I asked him &amp; he got upset  with me.&#160; I went into the center so that he &amp; Martha could take over for I  am worn out.&#160; Martha went to join the team &amp; I stayed in the center to work  with Paul, in putting all the winter bags back into the storage rooms, after the  new shelves were put in on Tuesday by the Eagle Scouts.&#160; I received an email  from Suzanne that she will be late today or not be able to came at all, so I  thought that I would be available to help out in the center for awhile.&#160; Martha  came in to re-group about an hour &amp; a half later.&#160; She told me that a guy  walked passed her on the sidewalk &amp; said that he wished that she was dead  &amp; then preceded to add that he thought hat he would come back to do the  job.&#160; I said "dear Martha, when someone threatens you, you have to call the  police".&#160; "Why didn't you come into the center to use my cell phone to call  911"??&#160; She said that the police wouldn't have done anything if she did call,  which was correct, but&#160;I don't want her or anyone else, to be out there &amp;

I went to the bush side to sidewalk counsel.&#160; A car rove  into the parking lot with a woman driving &amp; a man next to her.&#160; I told her  what was going on in there &amp; she just waved her hand as if to say 'so, I  don't care'.&#160; I called out to her again &amp; then continues to witness to the  cars driving by.&#160; Then all of a sudden I saw that she was walking towards me so  I got out my cell phone ready to take her picture as she turned the corner.&#160; She  started screaming at me right away, cell phone or not.&#160; She said that she was  here for rape counseling &amp; not abortion &amp; we upset her.&#160; She got right  in my face &amp; her husband , who was behind her, had to hold her back  from&#160;attacking me.&#160; I think that maybe she had an abortion, at some time in her  life, &amp; was triggered when she saw the graphic pictures.&#160; It's a  possibility, for she reacted a little to much, as a rape survivor.&#160; Then when  his wife went into Planned Parenthood the husband came out to scold me that we  were there &amp; I should have apologize to his wife for upsetting her.&#160; What!&#160;  Where is his rationale.&#160; We are here because they are killing people here.&#160; They  happen to have a rape counselor in there too.&#160; Why?&#160; If they cared about women,  they wouldn't be killing anyone &amp; just help women &amp; young girls &amp;  have a rape counselor to help them too.&#160; I am sorry for what happened to her  &amp; when I told her that it happened to me, so she didn't feel alone,&#160;she just  shook her hand down again as she did when she first drove into this evil place,  as if to say 'I don't care'. &#160;She didn't care&#160;that<em>&#160;I was raped.&#160;</em>&#160;When  it comes to anyone else but themselves they usually don't care.&#160; The workers in  the Rape Counseling Center came outside &amp; the Death Escort &amp; the people,  who were waiting on the bench for their friend who was in there, came over to  the sidewalk to look at all the commotion this woman was making.&#160; She went into  the abortion mill but didn't stay long.&#160; As they were leaving, for she was the  driver,&#160;I held up a Crucifix, of our Lord, &amp; told them that&#160;He loved them  &amp; for them to come to Him, for healing.&#160; I know that rape is a terrible  thing, a crime of control &amp; evil, so don't get me wrong for my heart went  out to her but abortion is terrible &amp; is evil &amp; it ends a life.&#160; Oh my  Lord, please help all these people here, get to Heaven.&#160;</font></span></span></div><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><font color="#000000">Later on&#160;a guy&#160;threw a condom at  me, when he &amp;

They were receptive to the truth &amp; were  blessed by us &amp; so was I blessed&#160;in meeting them too.&#160;</font></span></span></div><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div><hr /><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Tuesday, August 14, 2012 at Focus</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Martha &amp; I got to the center after Mass today  &amp; started to work immediately.&#160; I brought the bags I had in the car &amp;  started to put things away.&#160; It was about 1:15pm that Karen arrived &amp; I  asked her if she would bring me to the MINO (Mothers in Need of Others) camp to  get the donations that they had for us .&#160; She said "yes".&#160; But in the meantime  Chris,&#160;who prayers on the sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood,&#160;brought into  the center a young girl for a pregnancy test.&#160; I asked Dr. Karen if she would do  it &amp; she said that she would.&#160; The young girl was negative &amp; was angry  at herself that she gave into sex, at a party, when she wants to concentrate on  her studies.&#160; She will follow her dreams after today.&#160; She regrets that she gave  herself to this guy but will put it in the past &amp; go forward.&#160; Go Girl!!&#160;  Remain chaste &amp; follow your dreams, though if she was pregnant she would not  destroy the precious life growing inside her, but would include her son or  daughter to come with her to achieve her dreams.&#160; They would go together.&#160; Life  is precious handle with care.&#160;&#160; The sad part is that the High School Nurse  administered the 'Patch" birth control to her.&#160; How&#160; bizarre is that!!&#160; I  thought that you went to school to learn not to fornicate!!&#160; She's  graduated. <br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;<div>&#160;</div></div></div></font></span></span></strong></span></font></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><font face="Arial"><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Paul arrive to help us in the center so I was happy  that Martha wouldn't be alone in the center while we were away.&#160; Karen &amp; I  picked&#160;up some things at the garage on Exchange St. &amp; we went back to the  center to put them away.&#160; In the meantime I asked Karen if she would call the  clients, that were positive for pregnancy,&#160;to see if that wanted a free  ultrasound next Wednesday at the Grace Community Center.&#160; Then Martha said that  one of our longest seeing clients wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; My heart dropped,  for I was hoping that she would be listening to us by now as we speak truth to  her about not having sex outside of marriage.&#160;&#160;She has a desire to be pregnant  &amp; is raising her son in a not so good environment.&#160;&#160; I wish that I could get  through to her.&#160; I asked Karen if she would administer the pregnancy test &amp;  she was nice enough to do it for she had to pick up her daughter at 3pm.&#160; The  test was negative &amp; Karen did spend a lot of time talking with her.&#160; I hope  that it registered.&#160;</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></div></div></font></span></strong></span></font></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div>&#160;</div></span><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Wednesday, August 15, 2012 at Focus</span></span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed  Mother </font></span></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial"><div style="text-align: center;"><img data-height="268" data-width="188" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRHkofbI2Czk0Wm-sR9TwGbXa9781pNHy5hzUAnM9YE18QmI-myig" alt="" class="rg_hi uh_hi" id="rg_hi" style="WIDTH: 124px;

A. had a beautiful Mass at Our Lady of Victory  downtown.&#160; It felt like a little of Heaven.&#160; Martha &amp; I arrived at the  center only to be greeted by four women of all ages.&#160; I asked if this was one  family &amp; they said "yes".&#160; I lead them into the Material Aid Room &amp; they  were thrilled.&#160; They saw our A-Frame sign out on the sidewalk, at one time,  &amp; came back to check us out &amp; were blessed.&#160; Then the doorbell rang  again &amp; it was our mom who was beaten up by her husband who did some damage  to her eye.&#160; She said that he was in jai for now &amp; was hoping that he would  be there for awhile.&#160; She had papers from the ABW (Alternatives for Battered  Women).&#160; I made copies of them for our use in the center.&#160; Then she gave me a  hug &amp; thanked us for helping her to get away from her abusive husband.&#160;  Martha &amp; I are happy to help her or anyone who is in a difficult situation,  that's what we do as a pregnancy center.&#160; We take of mother &amp; child.&#160; She  was on her way back to her safe place.&#160;

he helped bring the boxes, filled with bread &amp; rolls &amp;  other goodies, into the center.&#160; What a blessing!&#160; Then after he left the  doorbell didn't stop ringing &amp; we saw about ten people right away.&#160; We were  happy to see that a lot of the shipment were going to those who are in need.&#160; A  young girl came &amp; gave Martha &amp; I a big hug &amp; thanked us for helping  her &amp; during her pregnancy.&#160;

She  was&#160;walking, on the sidewalk to go to the front lines,&#160;when a young girl &amp;  her father were walking towards Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that she stopped  them &amp; asked the young girl if she wanted a pregnancy test &amp; she said  "yes".&#160; Martha lead them to Focus to give her a test.&#160; The test was negative  &amp; she counseled her about abstinence.&#160; I went outside &amp; told Martha that  when she comes out I'll go into the center this afternoon because Suzanne, our  client advocate,&#160;wasn't here today.&#160; She said that would be fine.&#160; I was then  greeted&#160; by Rob &amp; he went outside before I did, so he could replace  Tom&#160;who&#160;was with Paul &amp; Mary Ann, who prays out on the front lines in the  morning, because Sheila was is the sidewalk counselor, was&#160;at a funeral this  morning.&#160;I came out&#160;to set up the signs, on the sidewalk, all though some were  already set up for us.&#160; I turned around to see the young woman &amp; her father  who were just in the Focus Center was talking to Rob &amp; then they walked into  Planned Parenthood with the old woman death escort peeking through the bushes to  make sure she didn't lose any victims today.&#160; She probably thinks that she's  helping these people that she leads into this abortion mill but she's not.&#160;  Twisted thinking&#160;or false compassion or she has a death agenda??&#160; I called out  to them as they were walking into the mill &amp; said that they are killing  little babies right now.&#160; They came out about 5 minutes later &amp; bumped into  Martha.&#160; They told her that Planned Parenthood was evil &amp; that they felt it  in there, for it was dark &amp; depressing.&#160; They went home after that  experience for they had all the information that Martha gave them earlier when  she spoke to them in the center.&#160; She wanted STD testing &amp; Martha gave her  Compass Care to go to not Planned Parenthood!!&#160; <br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul had beeped as he wen by us to indicated that  he had our lunch.&#160; I said that I was going in to eat &amp; then Martha asked to  go first &amp; I said "sure".&#160; She went in &amp; I was now by myself by the bush  side &amp; Rob was by the brick side of the building of Planned Parented.&#160; It  was just the two of us out there on the front lines.&#160; I had my back turned to  the street &amp; then all of a sudden I heard this angry voice falling upon me.&#160;  I turned around to see an enraged young man attacking me verbally with the  infamous words that are so accepted in this society now.&#160; He was complaining  that he could here me with the mega phone &amp; that he just moved in across the  street &amp; for me to go away &amp; If not he was going to call the police to  make sure that I was gone.&#160; Oh no here we go again with the neighbors, dear  Lord.&#160; I looked at him &amp; said "I'm sorry that you were so stupid to move in  across an abortion mill &amp; you can take up your complain to the Federal  Government for I have Freedom of Speech out here".&#160; He was so angry &amp; turned  around to leave in the middle of the street &amp; almost got hit by a car.&#160; I  thought that he was going into his condo, across the street,&#160;which was once  owned by Jim &amp; Sue, the meddlesome neighbors that plagued &amp;  persecuted,&#160;us for years out on the front lines.&#160; But I was wrong.&#160; He was going  into the garage to get a weapon, which is&#160;a tool called a Level, &amp;  threatened Rob with it.&#160; Rob then used my cell phone to call the police.&#160; He  then called over to the young guy that the police had been&#160;called. The kid got  into his car &amp; drove off giving us his IQ finger.&#160; In about 10 minutes two  police cars came driving up the street &amp; stopped their cars right in front  of the condo.&#160; Then a car with an older woman in it came &amp; drove into the  garage of the condo that he just left from.&#160;&#160;She didn't like in wife or sister.&#160;  The police got out of their cars &amp; Rob walked over to where they were  standing to tell them what just had happened.&#160; The police then rang the doorbell  of the condo.&#160;&#160; The officers spoke with her for a few minutes then spoke again  to Rob, who flagged me over, for I was still across the street,&#160;to give them my  account of the incident.&#160; I told the officers that Officer Chris M. represents  us pro lifers &amp; they nodded as their response.&#160; I told them what had happen  to my fist before he threatened Rob.&#160; The scoop was that this guy doesn't live  there but his mother &amp; father do.&#160; He wants to live with them but they don't  want him to.&#160; The police asked for his cell phone number but the mother said  that she didn't know the number :(&#160; They told her that he could get arrested for  what he did, for it was 2nd. degree harassment charge.&#160; Then the offices asked  Rob what he wanted done &amp; he had two options.&#160; One, was to have him arrested  by issuing an warrant out for his arrest or to call the police again he does  this again.&#160; Rob talked to me about it &amp; then when Dan &amp; Addison came to  the sidewalk to pray he asked them.&#160; Rob decided to give the guy one more chance  to redeem himself.&#160; I just said to him that I wanted Martha &amp; I to be safe,  for Rob will only be with us for one more week, &amp; then he'll be back to  teaching school.&#160; But I did understand his reasoning &amp; accepted his  decision, not to&#160;go for&#160;a&#160;warrant for this man's arrest.&#160; Besides the Judge  probably wouldn't even issue one.&#160; If he comes out swinging again I sure will  call the police &amp; have him arrested because some people don't learn unless  you go the extra mile.&#160; And some people never learn.&#160; I hope that he  will.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha came back out to the front lines &amp; I  told her what had happened while she was in the center.&#160; Since she was out on  the sidewalk &amp; so was Rob, Dan &amp; Addison were across the street praying,  I decided to go into the center to eat a quick lunch that Paul had gotten at  Wendy's.&#160; I went into the center &amp; greeted Paul who was hard at work  putting&#160;donations away.&#160; I thanked him for the lunch &amp; took two bites of the  hamburger &amp; then Paul said that someone wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I said  "okay" &amp; got up to greet our client.&#160; She was lead into Focus by Martha who  stopped her out on the sidewalk.&#160; She was new to Rochester &amp; a very nice  young woman, who was heading to Planned Parenthood for a pregnancy test when she  meet Martha.&#160; As I counseled her at Focus, she expressed, that she was so happy  not to have been exposed to their evil.&#160; She left with many positive brochures  &amp; a church bulletin to come back to the Catholic Church, to start over, with  her soul.&#160; As I was completion this pregnancy test a woman who was already in  the Material Aid Room getting things for her children asked me if she could have  a pregnancy test too.&#160; I said "yes, of course just give me about 10 minutes".&#160;  She said "that's fine".&#160;&#160; After I cleaned up the first pregnancy test I invited  her into the Counseling Room.&#160; Her test was positive.&#160; This is her 8th.child  &amp; thank God she doesn't believe in abortion.&#160; I told her that we will help  her during her pregnancy &amp; afterwards &amp; also for her 7 other children  too.&#160; She smiled.&#160; She was in shock &amp; cried a little&#160;but she will be fine.&#160;  I gave her the brochure on Natural Family Planning &amp; asked her to call my  friend Anne.&#160;Check:</span></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.dor.org/index.cfm/evangelization-catechesis/sacraments/marriage/natural-family-planning/"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">http://www.dor.org/index.cfm/evangelization-catechesis/sacraments/marriage/natural-family-planning/</span></span></span></a></font><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">.&#160;

One of our clients came into the  room where I was &amp; I asked her if she would answer the door &amp; that I did  appreciate it.&#160; She answered back to me saying "if you appreciate it I'll do  it".&#160; "Thanks" I hollered back as she was leaving the room to answer the front  door.&#160; It was Dan &amp; his cute 7 year old grandson, who acted more like he was  15 years old.&#160; So mature.&#160; They had both just come from the Barbers &amp;  stopped by to say "hi".&#160; I offered them some cookies &amp; the young man said  that they will have some desert first before stopping to go to Wendy's for their  treat for getting their hair cut.&#160; How cute.&#160; I talked with Dan for a few  minutes &amp; then went back outside to be with Martha &amp; Rob, Adolf was on  the other side of the street praying &amp; witnessing.&#160; Martha had to go into  the center when&#160;car drove passed&#160;me &amp; turned around up the street &amp;  stopped where I was standing.&#160; The woman in the car said "Go home what are you  doing here upsetting people".&#160; I asked her if she wanted some information &amp;  she replied that if it was from me then "no".&#160; "Okay" I said "then be on your  way".&#160; She said "no if you can be here so can I".&#160; Then Rob came over to where I  was standing, from where he was standing,&#160;by the brick side of the PP building.&#160;  He started talking to her about these pictures are teaching tools to some  parents.&#160; She didn't want to listen to anyone.&#160; She then said to me "if&#160;I drive  by with&#160;my children &amp; these pictures are out here then I'd be sorry"&#160; I said  "did you just threaten me &amp; I got my cell phone &amp; pretended to call the  police.&#160; She called out that she didn't threaten me &amp; a about a minute later  she drove away.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I thanked Rob for coming over to assist me with this  woman.&#160; Prayer &amp; Education (which is truth), are the Keys!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A mother of the young girl that she brought into  Planned Parenthood to have her grandchild killed drove out &amp; when the car  went passed by me I said "you have put a curse on your family, may God have  mercy on you both".&#160;&#160; Cars were coming out after their abortions....nothing can  be worse to see.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Rob helped bring in the signs &amp; all that we  bring out on the front lines, back into the center.&#160; Martha had supper waiting  for us.&#160;&#160; Melissa, our new volunteer,&#160;came tonight along with Tim who is her  friend &amp;

Peter Helfrich, for the Church of the Holy Spirit,  celebrating the Eucharist.&#160; We planned a picnic like supper for after the Mass,  so we always have much to do before the Mass at 6pm tonight.&#160; Tuesday's are our  most busiest day at the center so that plus getting the Mass ready was going to  be interesting.&#160; Thank God that Karen came at 1:15pm to help me.&#160; She answered  the door &amp; helped out the moms that were coming into the Material Aid Room  for 'free' clothes &amp; things for their children.&#160; I noticed that we were  short on diapers so Karen was nice enough to go to Sam's Club to get us more  diapers sizes 4 &amp; 5.&#160; The two most popular sizes for&#160;our clients.&#160; Before  she left Martha arrived &amp; brought us more diapers but we still needed more.&#160;  Martha &amp; I got to work answering the&#160;door to let&#160;our clients in &amp; she  did a pregnancy test too.&#160; Paul arrived to set up the Great Room.&#160;He set up the  altar &amp;&#160;set up&#160;the chairs for the Mass.&#160; He then went into the Green Room to  set up the tables for the supper.&#160; We were so busy.&#160; Fr. Peter arrived at 5:30pm  &amp; we greeted him &amp; lead him into the Great Room for the Mass tonight.&#160;  People started to arrive &amp; some brought food.&#160; We were planning to have  chicken, sausages, potato salad, macaroni salad, baked beans&#160;&amp; deserts.&#160; A  summertime feast :)&#160; The agenda for the Mass was: first the celebrating of the  Mass then the blessing of water &amp; salt for spiritual warfare &amp; then  after the Mass the Sacrament of the Sick then a short talk given by Rick, the  coordinator,&#160;in regards to the local '40 Days for Life' Campaign starting  September 26th., with the Kick Off Rally at Focus on September 25th..&#160;

So many varieties.&#160; Tim, was at  the door, dropping off donations &amp; he was blessed with bread to take home to  his large family :)&#160; Paul was with us &amp; he put away our new donations that  we were blessed with today.&#160; One of our clients came in to give us two bags of  donations &amp; we were grateful.&#160; She's been our client for three years now  &amp; she was blessed by us &amp; now she blesses us.&#160; I like that :)&#160;

Guys  really don't respect you when you give into them, even if they like it.&#160; Then  she's left devastated with a disease or a pregnancy &amp; usually makes things  worse by killing her own child, by abortion.&#160; She is now post abortive &amp;  depressed &amp; so on.&#160; I can only hope &amp; pray that she will get forgiveness  &amp; healing from the Lord &amp; have a life that will help others.&#160;</span></div></span></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><div>&#160;</div><hr /><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;<div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">Thursday, August 23, 2012&#160;on the Front  Lines</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I arrived after Mass &amp;

Rob went on the brick side of the building &amp; Martha &amp; I stayed by  the bush side, nearest the parking lot.&#160; I saw that Rob had spoken to a young  lady who was walking up the sidewalk.&#160; She then walked over to where Martha  &amp; I were &amp;&#160; said that the man over there said something about a place  that has free diapers.&#160; I said "come follow me".&#160; As I lead her into Focus, she  said that she didn't believe in abortion &amp; if she was pregnant she'd place  the baby up for adoption.&#160; I said that was the right thing to do.&#160; Suzanne, our  client advocate,&#160;hadn't arrived yet, so I took care of her.&#160; I showed her the  Material Aid Room &amp; then went &amp; got diapers for her.&#160; I gave her a  brochure &amp; she said "thank you".&#160; I knew that Rob had given her a Truth  packet on the sidewalk.&#160; She left &amp; I stayed to eat my&#160;hamburger quickly  that Paul had gotten from Wendy's,,,, delicious!&#160; I was almost finished when  Suzanne arrived.&#160; I spoke with her for a few minutes &amp; then went back  outside to rejoin Martha.&#160; Then she told me that the young girl that I had  brought into the center had come back outside &amp; walked into Planned  Parenthood.&#160; Martha said that she said something about contraceptives to her.&#160;  When she came back out, about an hour later, she went passed Rob on his side so  I walked over to where he was to talk to her.&#160; The old man Death Escort had  walked her onto the sidewalk &amp; he kept an eye on me as I crossed the street  towards her.&#160; I approached her gently &amp; asked her what she was doing in  there.&#160; I was concerned.&#160; She said that she was there for an STD (sexual  transmitted disease) test.&#160; I said "I didn't know that, for I could have  recommended two places, for you to go to get testing".&#160; I said "this place is  evil".&#160; I said "good bye" to her &amp; she walked up the street to maybe catch a  bus.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">A guy was smoking &amp; walking up &amp; down the sidewalk right in front  of the door of Planned Parenthood waiting for his precious baby to be killed,  instead of waiting for his baby to be born.&#160; How evil, how sad.&#160; When he drove  out of the parking, lot with his girlfriend slumped over in the front seat of  the car, he looked over at me &amp; gave me a smirkey look from Hell.&#160; I saw the  Devil.&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">I heard a commotion &amp; looked over across the street to see that Bill,  who is 82 years old had fallen.&#160; Rob was already running across the street to  help him.&#160; Adolph &amp; Addison went over to help him to.&#160; I crossed over to  where he was to help them.&#160; Rob picked up Bill from the street where he had  fallen when he got off of his stool &amp;&#160;lost his balance.&#160; Poor Bill, who  recently, had a heart attack.&#160; Lord have Mercy on our Bill who will be 83 years  old on September 25th..&#160; &#160;I looked over to see that the old man Death Escort had  crossed the street to ask if he could help.&#160; I said "please go away".&#160; I later  said to him &amp; his wife who had picked him up after a long afternoon of  helping women to have their babies killed by abortion.&#160; As they left I said to  them "if you&#160;are so nice how can you help to kill children"?&#160; I don't know how  they answered my question as they drove back home.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">One car after another came out after having their baby murdered by the  abortionist Rachel Phelps.&#160; Most of the woman gave me their middle finger.&#160; You  shouldn't be mad at me but you should be mad at yourself.&#160; I hope that you get  help &amp; God's forgiveness once you realize what you did here today.&#160; Post  abortive women &amp; men are angry people.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">A young girl was walking with two guys coming out of Gibbs. St., which is  far down the street to where I was standing alone, on the sidewalk, for Martha  was in the center.&#160; She screamed out loud to me saying "Blank you".&#160; I hollered  back to her saying "I hope that you will repent for your abortion which was a  sin".&#160; They disappeared down the street.&#160; I hope that she does.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">I then took that theme of 'sin' to the people going into Planned  Parenthood.&#160; A lot of people don't know about sin.&#160; They think whatever they do  is just fine with no consequences for their negative behavior.&#160; They are in for  a surprise someday.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Rob brought all the signs into the center &amp; then Martha, Rob &amp; I  had a nice supper.&#160; This was Rob's last supper with us on Thursdays for he'll be  going back to school teaching in a couple of weeks &amp; he needs to get his  classroom ready.&#160; It was a fast summer.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a blessing to have Natalie &amp; Faye come to help us from JUSTME,  self-Empowered Center for Women @ </span><a href="http://www.JustMeCenter.org"><span style="font-size: medium;">www.JustMeCenter.org</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">.&#160; They help us out  at Focus twice a month on a Thursday form 6pm to 8pm.&#160; They brought us some  diapers tonight, thanks ladies.&#160; They are so nice &amp; helpful :)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;</span><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><font face="Arial">Tuesday, August 28, 2012 at Focus</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I were pulling into the parking lot  after Mass when I saw two women &amp; four children heading our way,&#160; I greeted  them &amp; opened up the door to let them in.&#160; As I was opening the door I saw,  walking down the sidewalk a big family of a man&#160;&amp; a woman &amp; three  children &amp; offered them 'free' clothes for their children.&#160; The all came  into Focus &amp; were blessed.&#160; As they were all in the Material Aid Room &amp;  the children were running around the center asking for juice &amp; water, with  their sweet baby sister quietly sitting in her buggies just looking around &amp;  taking in all in.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; there were three young women at  the door.&#160; I lead them into the Green Room &amp; asked them to wait until the  other women left the Material Aid Room &amp; then they could go in to get what  they needed.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again &amp; it was a young mother with her  sweet young daughter in the stroller.&#160; She had to wait too.&#160; Then the doorbell  rang &amp; it was Tim coming in to drop off donations of clothes &amp; books  &amp; toys to our center.&#160; He was also waiting to get some 'free' bread that  will be coming soon, for him to take some home &amp; also to pass put to his  friends.&#160; Karen our volunteer came to help us out for a couple of hours.&#160; She  brought in some of the winter bags that she had stored in her house.&#160; She said  that every week she'll bring in some bags until they are all gone for her  basement.&#160; Thanks so much Karen!!&#160; The I asked her about my leg pain, for she is  a doctor.&#160; She told me about my shoes &amp; to take some pain medication until  I'm accumulated to the new shoes.&#160;

Thanks sweet Martha....how nice was that  :)&#160; Then Rick came to drop off the boxes of bread &amp; a couple of boxes of  canned food, for our food shelves.....how wonderful is this :)</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We saw so many more clients, helping them with  their needs, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Our new volunteer Linda came&#160;to help us,  at the center.&#160; She was a very good helper who put away many of the donations in  the Material Aid Room.&#160; She was very nice &amp; she will come back next week to  help us out again.&#160; Yeah!!&#160;&#160; Dajaih came with her two daughters&#160; &amp; brought  us some donations.&#160; She also got some things from the Material Aid Room  for&#160;her children.&#160; Her little girl looked at me  &amp; said "I like raisins".&#160; I said "that's great but we don't have any".&#160; I  felt badly about that.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I finished putting things away &amp;  we than sat down to have a chicken &amp; potato &amp; Cole slaw supper.&#160; Rick,  the coordinator for the '40 Days for Life', came &amp; we had an hour long  meeting.

in  travail.&#160; She also holds &amp; says her Rosary when she's out on the front lines  along with calling out information to&#160;the victims, that there is help for them  two doors down, the street.&#160; She counsels women &amp; girls when they stop to  talk with her on the sidewalk.&#160; Well, one guy pulling into the Death Camp,  didn't like what he saw this morning with Martha standing there praying, so he  decided to throw out his car window an empty bag of an already eaten McDonald's  breakfast.&#160; He really should have used the trash can at Planned Parenthood to  put it in but he decided to throw it at a woman who was standing there all  alone.&#160; What a coward!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We were so busy at Focus today &amp; it was just  Martha &amp; I working in the center &amp; assisting our many clients.&#160; I bought  diapers last night &amp; brought&#160;them in &amp; put them in a bag for our clients  &amp; at the end of the day two sizes were gone.&#160; I can't keep up.&#160; When we  walked into the center we were pleasantly surprised to see that our landlord  Bernie&#160;had the carpets cleaned.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; The only room that he missed doing was  the Material Aid Room, so I&#160; will buy carpet cleaner&#160;so we can spot clean that  small rug.&#160; No problem.&#160; He was happy with the color of the new paint in the  bathroom &amp; will buy us a vanity for the new sink.&#160; Tim came in &amp; he said  that he would help put it in so when Bernie came this afternoon I told him what  Tim said &amp; he was happy.&#160; I called Tim &amp; he &amp; Bernie talked &amp;  worked out the sink situation for our bathroom.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I had to call him later  because there was another water leak in the Great Room to which he said that he  will fix it tomorrow.&#160; We have a flat roof which causes me much grief with the  water in the ceiling dripping down on to the rugs.&#160; He goes up on the roof &amp;  try's to patch it up.&#160; It works for a short time&#160;then the ceiling springs  another leak some where else :(&#160; He needs about $20,000 to fix the entire roof  properly, of the mini strip mall that he owns, to which we rent just a part of  the space.&#160; I only&#160;wish.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We had two nice clients bring us bags of baby  &amp; children clothes, how nice was that!!&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was  Lynda.&#160; We were so happy to see her because we haven't seen her in awhile.&#160; She  wanted a sign to go out in front of Planned Parenthood to stand.&#160; She took the  sign that says 'PLANNED PARENTHOOD KILL BABIES'.&#160; Good for you Lynda.&#160; I got to  talk to her for awhile &amp; it looks like her daughter &amp; her want to  volunteer at Focus.&#160; Great!!&#160; That would be sooo good.&#160; I gave her two Truth  packets &amp; off she went outside to witness.&#160;Martha &amp; I were so thrilled  to have someone outside on the sidewalk to witness &amp; to counsel&#160; because we  are so very busy, in the center, we can't get out there like we once did. &#160;When  she came&#160;back into the center about an hour later she told us that she spoke  with a gentleman for about 15 minutes while his girlfriend, who had 6 abortions  in the past, was getting her birth control.&#160; He said that she didn't like  Planned Parenthood &amp; that he was going to put all the information that Lynda  just gave him in the Truth packet on Facebook.&#160; I hope that he means it.&#160; I also  hope that his girlfriend will repent for the 6 murders that she committed.&#160; We  said "good bye" to Lynda &amp; off she went home.&#160; A very wonderful &amp;  energetic lady &amp; her husband Bill is nice too.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I then made up about 15 Truth packets  for the sidewalk counseling ministry on Thursdays, for that's the day that they  do surgical abortions.&#160; So evil &amp; so sad.&#160; When done Martha made supper  &amp; then she left &amp; I stayed to do more work &amp; then to the store to  pick up two throw rugs to protect the carpet from spills from the kitchenette.&#160;  Thank God I have the money to do this :)&#160;

told her that I would be late.&#160; She said  "fine but be there".&#160; "Okay, I said back to her".&#160; Come to find out later on  that she wasn't feeling very well either but she hung in there until 7pm  tonight.&#160; What a trooper she is!!&#160; I arrived around 1:15pm only to find that  there was so many people in the center requesting assistance.&#160; One of our  clients, who is pregnant with her 8th. baby came in to tell us that her &amp;  her husband &amp; family were evicted because there was so many problems with  the house that the landlord needs to fix that the Department of Social Services  told this family that they needed to leave for it wasn't safe.&#160; They put them up  in a temporary shelter until October 1st. then they can move into their new  apartment.&#160; Our client was so stressed out but she got some nice things for her  children in the Material Aid Room.&#160; She is scheduled for a 'free' ultrasound  next Wednesday at His Branches Medical Office, along with her friend.&#160; I talked  to her for a few minutes, to encourage &amp; comfort her,&#160;as the doorbell kept  on ringing off the wall.&#160; Paul was there &amp; he asked me to stay with him in  the center.&#160; He didn't even go out to lunch today because it was so busy.&#160; He  ate at the center some food we had in the refrigerator.&#160; Sheila, who sidewalk  counsels, from 10:30am to 1pm, came in to say "good bye" to me &amp; she told me  that she did a pregnancy test earlier this morning.&#160; Great job Sheila.&#160; As I was  going outside, to get&#160;the donations&#160;from my car, I saw a couple with a young  child in a stroller walking up the sidewalk so I invited them into the center  for 'free' clothes &amp; small items.&#160; They were thrilled, to say the least.&#160; I  also gave them information for housing &amp; furniture.&#160; They left very happy.&#160;  I went outside to inform Martha that I was going to stay in the center because  we were so busy.&#160; She said "fine &amp; I'll stay on the sidewalk to prayer &amp;  counsel".&#160; Sounds like a plan dear Martha.&#160; There were Addison &amp; Dan &amp;  Adlof &amp; Mary Ann with her, so I was relieved.&#160; I went back into the center  to continue to serve the public.&#160; On of our girls asked me if I had something  for her to eat because she was just diagnosed with Diabetes.&#160; I gave her some  crackers, she felt better.&#160; Suzanne called me to tell me that she was running  late &amp; t expect her soon.&#160; I then called Dr. Karen &amp; told her that we  had 3 girls scheduled for ultrasounds this Wednesday &amp; she said that's  great.&#160; Then I asked her if she could switch from Tuesdays to Thursdays because  we are so busy in the center &amp; on the front lines.&#160; She said that she would  &amp; will start a week from today.&#160; Thanks Karen!!&#160; I received a call on my  cell around 12 noon today &amp; I scheduled a pregnancy test for her at 2:30pm.&#160;  She came a little earlier with her boyfriend.&#160; We all had a nice talk &amp; I  was blessed by meeting them.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Suzanne came around 2:45pm just as this couple were  leaving.&#160; I then talked with Suzanne for a short time&#160;&amp; then went out to the  front lines while Martha came into the center to regroup.&#160; Lynda was outside so  I joined her out on the sidewalk.&#160; She told me that a Protestant preacher told  hi congregation that it was okay to have&#160;Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP), which kills embryos (which  is a fertilized egg, which is a person).&#160; He just said "don't do it to many  times, like one baby isn't enough????&#160; What a distorted message &amp; so wrong  &amp; so evil.&#160;&#160;He should&#160;read the New Testament which says&#160;in James 3:1 NIV  ,"Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know  that we who teach will be judged more strictly".&#160; I hope that he repents.&#160; Lynda  &amp; I were speaking to the people going in &amp; coming out of the abortion  mill.&#160; We&#160;started to talk to two girls, that came out of Planned Parenthood, to  try to help them.&#160; The one girl said that we were&#160;not nice in&#160;talking to&#160;them.&#160;  They walked right passed us, on the sidewalk,&#160;it's not like we chased them down  the street.&#160; They must have felt guilty about something?&#160; &#160;Who can figure out,  the responses of people, we just try to do our best to offer them  help....rejection &amp; abuse&#160;&amp; pain are&#160;a part of&#160;our&#160;ministry.&#160; Lynda  stayed about an half hour more then left.&#160; Martha came back out to join me.&#160; She  told me that earlier in the afternoon a man came from Planned Parenthood to talk  to her.&#160; He said that he &amp; his wife had 5 children &amp; there were hear to  abort baby #6.&#160; Martha responded back to him that his mother didn't stop here.&#160;  He answered her saying "that's right, my mother had 10 children".&#160; He then  looked over to the picture of the aborted baby that we show out on the front  lines &amp; he said "that baby is to big our baby was smaller".&#160; You can  certainly try to justify your crime but it won't work, you're only fooling  yourself.&#160;&#160; Ironically, the picture that he made a comment about, was the same  age as his son or daughter was, that he had killed here today.&#160; He was so  blind.&#160; He will be held more accountable because he is the man &amp; he is  suppose to protect is wife &amp; child, but failed here today.&#160; When his wife  came out she was crying unceasingly.&#160; Their hell has begun.&#160; I hope that they  repent &amp; I feel so very sorry for their other children who will learn the  truth, of what their mother &amp; father did here today, &amp; it will affect  them all.&#160; Lord have Mercy.&#160;</span></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Co</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">ming down the street was our client that we just  saw this week in the center.&#160; She&#160;is scheduled for an ultrasound with Dr. Karen  this Wednesday at HIS Branches Medical Office.&#160; She was pushing her son in a  stroller to our pregnancy center, for children's clothes.&#160; She had an  abortion&#160;when she was&#160;14 years old, &amp; her boyfriend didn't want her&#160;abort  the baby,&#160;but she went ahead &amp; did it.&#160; She said "she was my girl".&#160; After  the abortion she went into a deep depression for years but her boyfriend stuck  by her &amp; she has a son &amp; is now pregnant.&#160; She had to go by all the  graphic signs, on the sidewalk, &amp; she looked at them.&#160; Abortion will never  go away but the pain can lessen in time with much prayer &amp; counseling.&#160; We  gave her, when we saw her in the center on Tuesday, Post Abortion Information  for more healing &amp; forgiveness.&#160; It's a life long process, once the woman or  man, come out of denial.&#160; We always encourage, for our clients, to wait to have  sex&#160;until they are married.&#160; Lust can ruin your life!!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was in the center &amp; Adolf had to go so I  was now by myself, on the sidewalk with the Lord, who protects me.&#160; A man came  walking, from around the bushes to where I was standing,&#160;&amp; it was Rick  Bartell, who works at Planned Parenthood.&#160; He's been there for almost as long as  I've&#160; been there on the front lines. He said "good afternoon Mary".&#160; I said back  to him that I pray for him but I don't want him to speak to me.&#160; Sorry but my  stomach churns because he was directly involved in many abortions by walking the  girls in there to have their baby killed.&#160; But I can certainly speak to him,  which I did.&#160; I told him, as he was walking, that he was headed for hell &amp;  that it would be evil of me not to tell him.&#160; I said&#160;"do not to play Russian  Roulette with&#160;your soul, for you are involved in the abortion industry which is  a Mortal Sin, that if not confessed, with a sincere heart, can lead you straight  there.&#160; He turned the corner to Gibbs St..&#160; All I can do is to tell him the  Truth &amp; he must do the rest, to save his soul.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I went back into the center to join Martha who  wasn't feeling good at all so she went home.&#160; I hope that you'll feel better  real soon sweet lady.&#160; I stayed until 10pm &amp; went home.&#160; </span></span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<div><div><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);">Therefore, my  dear brothers and sisters, stand firm.

Joe Cantaise from St. Leo's the Great Church, Pastor  Everett &amp; Jim Hardon the Present of Compass Care.&#160; Mark &amp; his wife, our  musical team, came to bless us.&#160; Rick was the host &amp; he did a great job  introducing the speakers &amp; the musical team.&#160; He showed a short track from  the DVD '180 Degrees'.&#160; It was poignant &amp; it brought tears to my eyes &amp;  to others who watched it.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Then to my surprise when I left the Great Room to enter the Green Room  there was Mike, my former boyfriend, standing there.&#160; At first my heart dropped  &amp; I was semi cool as I&#160;acknowledged him briefly as I passed by him.&#160; As I  entered into the Green Room I felt the grace from God fall upon me to go back to  greet him &amp; to talk to him briefly.&#160; I did &amp; to my surprise he handed me  a wad of cash saying it for the work at the center.&#160; I thanked him &amp; spoke  to him for less than a minute, for I was very busy.&#160; I put it right away into  the office &amp; closed the door.&#160; Later on I had time to count the cash &amp;  there was 20, $50 bills, which added up to be $1,000, for our center.&#160; Praise  God!!&#160; God is great all the time!!&#160;&#160;I wish Mike a fine &amp; healthy  retirement....enjoy :)</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was Pat, our grandmother &amp; great  grandmother.&#160; She came in &amp; she was greeted by Martha &amp; I.&#160; She said  that she didn't want to speak tonight to share her intense stories about her  greatgrand babies who were almost aborted.&#160; She said that she was suffering with  pneumonia &amp; was taking her first antibiotic for the cure.&#160; Pastor Everett  greeted her &amp; spoke with her for awhile &amp; he took down her phone number  for further conversations.&#160; Martha served her with some food &amp; I sat down to  talk with her.&#160; Later on the taxi took her home with the table that I got for  her at the Second Thought Resale Store.&#160;God gave her what she requested &amp; I  thank Him for it.&#160; The table was perfect for her needs.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">After the rally most of the people went out with candles, to&#160;walk to  Planned Parenthood, to pray the prayers, on a sheet of paper,&#160;that Rick gave  each one.&#160; It was powerful to see all the people in the dark holding candles  &amp; praying,&#160;in front of the Killing Mill, Planned Parenthood.&#160; What an  evening to say the least !!!!!!!!!</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep  back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have  dominion over me!

She had an abortion in the past so I knew that she was  vulnerable to do it again but hoping she wouldn't.&#160; I asked her, now on the  phone,&#160;if she had aborted her last pregnancy &amp; she said that she did for she  didn't have the money to take care of the child.&#160; I said &amp; look at you now  you're not being blessed.&#160; When the Lord creates a life He takes care of that  life, you didn't trust Him.&#160;You knew that your son knew that you were pregnant  &amp;&#160;now you're not, you didn't care how&#160;he will be&#160;effected by this  abortion.&#160;&#160;I then went on to say to her "you took a life &amp; when you realize  what you did &amp; own it we can get you post abortion help at Focus for your  healing".&#160; I then said her name &amp; "good bye" &amp; hung up the phone.&#160; My  heart sank.&#160; My knees were weak as I continued to get ready to leave my  apartment.&#160;&#160;All the email list had prayed so hard that she wouldn't have JJ  killed &amp; she did it anyway.&#160; All she thought of was herself.&#160; Her two babies  dead &amp; her son will be effected for the rest of his life, by what she's  done.&#160; How come I was spared mom, you could have killed me too.&#160; I don't have my  siblings in my life, I'm so lonely mom &amp; so on.&#160; The irony was that when she  came into the center, for the pregnancy test, her son already knew that she was  pregnant &amp; told her where the baby was in her belly.&#160; How  could&#160;you???????<br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">After Mass, Martha, took me to the bank downtown to  deposit the cash from yesterday &amp; some donations too.&#160; I wanted to get out  of this bank as fast as I could for it had been robbed two days ago.&#160; But that  wasn't the case.&#160; I asked if one of our checks had cleared &amp; two bank  tellers couldn't find the information on the screen &amp; I almost screamed.&#160;  About 10 minutes later I was out of there.&#160; Martha was waiting patiently &amp;  brought back to the church to get my car.&#160; I was trapped by the buses for&#160;7  minutes.&#160; Frustrated I got to the center at 1:15pm.&#160; Martha had to go to the  post office &amp; to Wendy's for our lunch &amp; she got back to the center  around 2pm.&#160;&#160;We were very busy taking care of the  clients &amp; me doing the work in the office.&#160; Paul came &amp; Linda came a  little later &amp; helped put</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> away the donations.&#160; Then my cell rang.&#160; I  answered it &amp; it was one of the girls&#160; from the Elim Bible Institute asking  if they were suppose to be there this evening for it was&#160; about 4:15pm now &amp;  they are about 30 minutes away.&#160; I said "yes I think so".&#160; The reply was we're  on our way.&#160; I answered back "that's great"!!&#160; The three young ladies arrived  about 5pm.&#160; We all introduced ourselves &amp; I asked if that would fill out our  form &amp; then Martha &amp; I showed them around the </span>center.&#160;<span style="font-size: medium;"> I then gave them  an assignment.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was Faye, from the 'Just Me' group,  to volunteer her time tonight.&#160; She brought in some donations to which I was  grateful.&#160; The students were very happy when I told them that they could take  something from the Material Aid Center to take with them.&#160; The two girls took  sweaters &amp; the other girl took a book, very wise.&#160; They enjoyed their  experience &amp; were excited to come back next Wednesday.&#160; Martha &amp; I took  some time to talk to Faye, which was a blessing.&#160; She's had many surgeries &amp;  heart problems &amp; still at 63 is going strong, with the blessing from God who  she trusts.&#160; Praise God for everything happy or sad.&#160; He's in control &amp; He  loves us all the time.&#160; Martha &amp;&#160;I went home happy.</span></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Thursday, September 27, on the Front  Lines</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This day is the hardest day to write about.&#160;

Yeah!&#160; I went into the  center &amp;&#160;talked with&#160;Dr.Karen when she&#160;came a short time after I arrived.&#160; I  still was having nausea &amp; we discussed some ideas of what it could be.&#160; It  turned out to be the&#160;new multi vitamins that increased my metabolism that caused  me much grief.&#160; The good that came&#160;from all the suffering was that I lost about  10 lbs. &amp; now I want it to stay off so I'm changing my eating habits &amp;

I were to come out to continue the prayers &amp; presence.&#160;  Suzanne arrived about 1:30pm &amp; I got to talk with her for a short time.&#160; I  had a quick lunch &amp; did some things then went out to the war zone, where  they are killing&#160; American citizens.&#160; Dan had arrived &amp; I spoke with him for  a few minutes before he went out on the front lines.&#160; He walks up &amp; down the  sidewalk, even in the Buffer Zone,&#160;with a sign &amp; a small Bible.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was horrible from 2pm until I left around  6:40pm.&#160; Cars coming out with the woman or girl slumped out either in the front  seat or the back seat.&#160; One was slumped&#160;was smoking a cigarette.&#160; One came out  with three guys &amp; one post abortive girl &amp; they threw something hard at  Martha &amp; I as they left the parking lot.&#160; I still don't know what it was but  it was hard for when it hit the sidewalk it made a loud noise.&#160; We were grateful  to God that it didn't hit us but we had no time to look around to see what it  was.&#160; The Death Escort had gone into PP to get Rick Bartell out to see what Dan  was doing.&#160; I heard Bartell say to the Death Escort that what he was doing was  okay because he was walking &amp; not standing still.&#160; Oh yeah!!&#160; This is still  America!!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A young man was sitting on the bench, in front of  the building of death.&#160; I engaged him with some information.&#160; When he drove out  of the parking lot about 30 minutes later I asked him if she was in there  killing hi baby.&#160; He said "no, we're not here for that" &amp; left.&#160; He came  back about 20 minutes later &amp; waited for her to come out about an hour  later.&#160; When he drove out he came out so fast that he burned rubber.&#160; I hollered  to them to repent for killing their child.&#160; You can lie to me &amp; to yourself  but God saw it all.&#160; Like I said to him "no one is going to get away with  murder, repent".&#160; I&#160; say&#160;to those who I figured had an abortion by&#160;her slumping  down in the car or&#160;her wearing a white wrist band to &#160;"repent for the sin of  murder".&#160;

felt beaten by a pulp so I  let my guard down so when I saw the same man driving by giving me his finger  &amp; said something to him I'm not proud of.&#160; I didn't use God's&#160;name in vain  or use the F word but I was crass in my response back to him.&#160; I went to the  Sacrament of Confession, the next day, for I am to represent Christ out there no  matter what.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Scott, who is blind, came to pray &amp; when it was  time for him to leave it was a fiasco.&#160; He had called the taxi &amp; gave  Planned Parenthood's address so the driver pulls into their parking lot &amp;  stays there, even though we're hollering for him to come to the sidewalk where  hi customer is standing.&#160; No comprendo.&#160; I called Afendi, who was&#160;in  charge,&#160;to&#160;ask him to call his driver to tell him that his pickup&#160;was standing  out on the sidewalk but that got messed up too.&#160; I was very stressed out at this  point.&#160; The taxi driver finally pulled out of the parking lot &amp; we were  all&#160;calling out to him to stop for this&#160;customer but he didn't.&#160; I saw that he  had&#160;pulled into our parking lot so I walked over to where he was &amp; tried to  explain to him to go back &amp; pick up Scott.&#160; He finally understood &amp; went  back over to pick him up.&#160; He's from another country &amp; it was difficult to  get through to him &amp; he's older &amp; hard of hearing to boot.&#160; I told Scott  the next time he's here, on the front lines, to give Buckpitt's address so that  this doesn't happen again or I'll scream.&#160; He agreed.&#160; Then John came to pray,  he has poor eye sight, though he's not blind.&#160; He prayed &amp; had words of  encouragement for me.&#160; Thank you John.&#160; Our usual guys were across the street  praying, Dan. Adolf, Addison &amp; Yan had joined them for 20 minutes before he  had to leave.&#160; There was a lot of prayer power which was awesome.&#160; I had&#160;lead  two cars, at different times but very close together,&#160;that were coming out of  Planned Parenthood over to Focus.&#160; One young woman knew that she was pregnant  &amp; Suzanne ministered to her &amp; her girlfriend in the Rose Room.&#160; Then  another young woman wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; She was with her girlfriend.&#160; I  brought them into the Material Aid Room to&#160; get what they needed, while they  waited.&#160; She said that Planned Parenthood wouldn't do a pregnancy test.&#160; I told  her that they were to busy killing children to do one.&#160; After Suzanne was  finished she brought the other two young women into the Rose Room.&#160; She was  positive but not abortion minded thank God.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I went back outside to join Martha &amp; John for  everyone else had left.&#160; I did have some graphic signs out there &amp; a mini  van pulled in to the parking lot &amp; the male driver said that he didn't  appreciate us having those signs out here for she had an 8 year old boy in the  back seat.&#160; I responded back to him saying "you shouldn't be here at all" then  he said something like "you're crazy to which I replied "so are you".&#160; He waited  in the parking lot for about 30 minutes &amp; when he came out he had a female  in the front seat just staring &amp; he gave me a look from Hell.&#160; He was  smirking &amp; had put up his thumb finger as if to say "yeah, she did it &amp;  you couldn't stop her so hey hippie".&#160; It was sick &amp; demonic &amp; it made  both Martha's &amp; my blood curdle.&#160; Lord have Mercy on their souls.&#160; I feel so  sorry for that precious baby that they murdered &amp; for their 8 year old son  who lost a brother or sister here today.&#160; They won't get away with murder  either.&#160; They have to stand before Almighty God someday &amp; I hope that they  &amp; all of them repent with a sincere heart before they die.&#160; There is a Hell  &amp; it's forever!!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jim the neighbor in the condo was walking with his  friend from Windsor St. to his condo when all of a sudden he hollered "Mary"  &amp; waved.&#160; I just ignored him, for I just don't want to start up anything  with him again.&#160; At that time I was&#160;talking to a woman who was coming out of the  driveway of Planned Parenthood &amp;&#160;I was strong with my words to her, sort of  tough love, but I knew that Jim, from across the street, wouldn't approve so I  didn't want to engage him in any back &amp; forth debate.&#160;&#160; I will pick my  battles.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Three girls came out of Planned Parenthood &amp;  they appeared to be non responsive to what we were saying to them.&#160; Then all of  a sudden they changed their attitude.&#160; Martha&#160; &amp; I were able to talk to them  &amp; give them a Truth packet &amp; other information.&#160; The Power of Prayer  :)</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was in the center &amp; John had to leave  &amp; that left me out on the front lines alone.&#160; I felt forlorn but not ready  to give up for I know that God is in control &amp; He will take care of them all  in the end.&#160; I always&#160;hope &amp; pray that they all will 'repent' though I know  that all will not be saved.&#160; I was standing there, by the fence,&#160;informing&#160;a&#160;man  in his car waiting for the woman he brought in earlier to have an abortion, the  Truth about&#160;abortion &amp; how it will effect his &amp; her life when I saw a  woman walking up the sidewalk.&#160; I was all&#160;out of words but I did muster up a  "hello" when she passed by me.&#160; She&#160;acknowledged&#160;my words to her.&#160; &#160;I was afraid  that she was going to be nasty &amp; I was worn out but willing to take it for  Christ.&#160; Look what He did for me on the Cross.&#160; To my surprise I saw that she  had turned around &amp; started to walk towards me.&#160; I was hoping that this was  good which it was.&#160; She came up to me &amp; said "it doesn't matter where I  stand on the subject I just want you to know that what you're doing is very good  &amp; I know that you take a bunch of crap from people but you keep on 'standing  alone for your cause.&#160; I just want you to know that God is well pleased with  you".&#160; I said back to her that I didn't deserve such a comment &amp; she said "I  know why you feel that way".&#160; I then said "than you for your kind words to me,  it was very nice of you".&#160; I asked her name &amp; she said "Michelle" &amp; I  said that my name was "Mary".&#160; I said that I will place her into my heart &amp;  pray for her.&#160; She said "thank you Mary".&#160; We gave each other a brief hug &amp;  she went back walking up the street to her destination.&#160; I thanked the Lord for  this healing encounter.&#160; I stayed out there a little while longer &amp; went  into the center to join Martha.&#160; </span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-size: medium;"><hr /></span></span></div></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-size: smaller;"><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Tuesday, October 2, 2012 at Focus</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We were soooo busy!&#160; We met Joan who is the new  director of the Women's Care Center, at the noon Mass.&#160; She came to Focus to  look around &amp; then we talked for a&#160;short time, for she needed to go to the  front lines, to pray during the '40 Days for Life' campaign.&#160; The doorbell rang  &amp; it was a&#160;young girl &amp; guy for a pregnancy test.&#160; Martha did that  appointment &amp; she was negative.&#160; She had the prongs of hormones pierced into  her skin , for birth control,&amp; I gave her boyfriend the brochure on the  poison she was taking.&#160; Martha did the rest of the counseling.&#160; After they left  four young people came into the center.&#160; The one young man was talking about  condoms &amp; Martha talked to him &amp; set him straight.&#160; I gave him&#160;a Truth  packet.&#160;&#160;Martha asked him if he had school today &amp; he told her that he over  slept so he didn't go to&#160;school today.&#160; Martha told him that he needed to go to  school every day.&#160; Take heed young man.&#160;I told him that he was our future but  when I said that I felt uneasy. &#160;Rebecca, our client,&#160;was here for the child  walker that we promised her for the past 3 weeks, for I had to order a part  &amp; the company messed up twice, so it look 3 weeks to fix up&#160;the mess &amp;  sent me the right part for the walker in order to be safe.&#160;She was thrilled  &amp; so were we.&#160; After they left I asked Martha to do another pregnancy test  which was negative &amp; she did some teaching &amp; handed her out some  informative brochures.&#160; Then Paul arrived to our joy!!&#160; He was kept very busy  today doing so much work with the answering the door &amp; handing out diapers  &amp; cleaning the toys &amp; stroller that we received &amp; putting away the  bags of donations that we received.&#160; Go Paul Go!!&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was Joan walking in with  a young woman.&#160; She introduced her to me saying that she was headed to Planned  Parenthood for an ultrasound.&#160; Not good for they try to talk the woman or girl,  in having an abortion, saying that the fetus is so small that this is the  perfect time to do it :(&#160; Evil Planned Parenthood!&#160; &#160;I took the two women into  the office because Martha was doing a pregnancy test &amp; counseling in the  Rose Room.&#160; I did have to go into the Rose Room several times to get what my  client needed.&#160; Joan &amp; I spoke with her &amp; set up an appointment for an  ultrasound which was set up for today at 4pm.&#160; I noticed that she had checked  off that she had abortions in her past.&#160; I&#160;listened to what she had to say &amp;  later on I spoke to her privately&#160;saying "the day that you take full  responsibility for what you did &amp; not blame anyone else is the day that&#160;you  start to heal".&#160;&#160;I gave her many post&#160;abortion brochures.&#160; I told her that if  she repents, with a sincere heart she will be greeted by her children, when she  dies, &amp; she will spend all eternity with&#160;her two children.&#160; She was teary  eyed. &#160;She had shared that she once believed in God but because so much has  happened to her that she no&#160;longer believes in God.&#160; I said "you would cry  if&#160;you knew what had happened to me, in the past,&#160;but I love God &amp; that  everyone on earth goes through something &amp; that He didn't say it would be  easy but&#160;He did say that He&#160;would be&#160;with us through it all".&#160; &#160;Also, I said  that&#160;the Lord died for our sins &amp; that's amazing!&#160; She smiled.&#160; I&#160;said "good  bye" &amp; off she went starting her 'new life' hopefully.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Pat, our grandmother &amp; great grandmother,  called me &amp; said that she was headed to the hospital for tests tomorrow  &amp; that Kyeir, who is still in the Nick Unit at the hospital,&#160;had an  infection &amp; was having a blood transfusion today.&#160; You hang in there sweet  baby, who is now over 3 lbs..&#160;Pat said that she will stop by our center after  her appointment.&#160; She's not getting better with her pneumonia.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Linda, our newest volunteer, came to help us out  today.&#160; She comes after work on Tuesday's. She's a blessing.&#160; It was so funny  when I heard Martha scream because there was a&#160;big brown bug flying around, she  never lived in Florida like I did&#160;for 3 years, talk about flying bugs.&#160; She got  the fly swatter &amp; I was swattering the poor bug, throughout the rooms.&#160; It  landed in the Material Aid Room&#160;&amp; I closed the door behind me. Now it was  just the big brown bug &amp; me &amp; the swatter, &amp; I won.&#160; &#160;Martha &amp;  Linda were happy&#160;&amp; I was sad, no&#160;need to get violent with bugs  :(&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I was so busy in the office.&#160; Martha called the  companies, to see if the 3&#160;strollers that had just come in, had any recalls,  which they didn't.&#160; Yeah!&#160; One of our clients came &amp; helped us&#160;out in the  center &amp; then took one of the strollers home with her for her son.&#160; A  grandmother came &amp; got the other stroller&#160;&amp; we called another client who  had been waiting for awhile came &amp; got the double stroller.&#160; All were&#160;so  happy!!&#160; Two of our past clients came in for a pregnancy test.&#160; It was sad to  see that their behavior hadn't changed much.&#160; Where is their mother, for they  are sisters??&#160; I&#160;think that the grandmother tries but the girls are falling into  the same negative behavior again.&#160; Lord have mercy!!&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul had left the water running in our kitchenette  while he was servicing our clients, so when he came back into the room the water  had run down the counter &amp; onto the floor.&#160; Poor Paul.&#160; He said that this  was his suffering.&#160; No need to worry, it's only water.&#160; I'm not  mad.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The phone rang &amp; it was a lady needing  direction to our center.&#160; When she arrived she was most certainly blessed, for  she had taken many bags of books &amp; things.&#160; I was happy to see the books go  for we are trying to promote breast feeding &amp; reading.&#160; Ni, who volunteers  on Mondays, categorized the books into age groups &amp; cook books .... thanks  Ni &amp; it looks marvelous!&#160; Very effective so the clients don't&#160; have to  muddle through all the books to get the age appropriate books that they need.&#160;  Great job!!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We were blessed, by some home schoolers, with some  non perishable food &amp;

walked up to her &amp; showed her, her&#160;gun in a  holster &amp; then left to go into her car &amp; drive away.&#160; I called Rick, the  coordinator of the '40 Days for Life' campaign, &amp; reported this incident.&#160;

I  had to make so many copies,&#160;for referrals for our clients.&#160; I'm so happy that  they are taking them.&#160; &#160;Martha made supper &amp; it was good &amp; she left  before me to go home like always, for she is so tied &amp; rightly so around 7pm  she fizzles out but she usually stays to 8pm....what a trooper&#160;.&#160; I'm more of a  night person &amp; I had to stay to finish my office work.&#160; What a blessed  day!!&#160;

she had her tubes tied but thought that she was pregnant.&#160; I  tried to comfort her&#160;in saying "let God be God".&#160; She said if she was pregnant  that would be okay.&#160; The test was negative.&#160; I did speak to her about the  Tubal&#160;Ligation&#160;&amp; gave her a brochure.&#160; She said that she was Catholic &amp;  encouraged for her to go to Confession before going to Holy Communion.&#160; I  said&#160;for her to speak to the priest in Confession even though you weren't aware  that it was a Mortal Sin.&#160; &#160;Sometimes we have to  take care of the soul.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp;

Martha &amp; she started  talking &amp; one thing lead to another when she mentioned that she was pregnant  &amp; had to have an abortion because she just lost her job.&#160; Martha disagreed  &amp; gave her a pregnancy test which was negative, thank God!&#160;

The  woman who was scheduling the speakers put Martha on the spot.&#160; She asked her  what she was going to talk about &amp; Martha said about pro life issues.&#160; Then  the woman said that was not a good idea.&#160; So Martha spoke with her briefly &amp;  then gave her our Focus Brochure &amp; one of our Truth packets &amp; left.&#160;  When she returned back t Focus she was livid &amp; didn't speak about the event  until much later in the afternoon.&#160; Sorry !&#160; When  Martha returned, back to the center, she started to help two of our clients with  diapers, that had just come in for clothes.&#160; She was back &amp; I was glad!!&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The door bell kept on ringing but not as often as  on Tuesdays.&#160; Martha did two pregnancy tests, which were both negative&#160;&amp; did  some educational talking with each client.&#160; Great job Martha!!&#160; Then she went  outside to pray &amp; to witness.&#160; I decided to join her after she was outside  for about an hour &amp; a half.&#160; As I was heading out to join her on the front  lines Debra came to join us.&#160; Martha stayed outside for another 10 minutes then  went back inside the center.&#160; That left Lynda &amp; I outside by ourselves.&#160; A  man came out of the back door &amp; headed up to the sidewalk &amp; was on the  phone.&#160; Then I spoke with him after he hung up the phone.&#160; He said that he was  there for a test &amp; was against abortion so I gave him a Truth packet to  which he walked back into the Planned Parenthood parking lot &amp; went back  into the back door.&#160; Only God knows what he was doing &amp; I hope that the  Truth packet will aid him.&#160; Then a few minutes after the man went back into the  Killing Mill did a woman with a young boy about 17 years old came out of the  parking lot to pull out of the driveway onto the street.&#160; The woman said to  Lynda &amp; I that she didn't believe in abortion but she was here for condoms  for her son.&#160; I said that condoms were the problem &amp; not the answer.&#160; I then  said for him to wait for marriage for sex &amp; not until.&#160; As they were driving  up the street he hollered something to Lynda &amp; I.&#160; His voice was squeaky  &amp; we wish him well &amp; a good &amp; holy life.&#160; After this incident  Lynda&#160;left.&#160; She went home &amp; I went back into the center.&#160; <br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Again, more doorbells were ringing.&#160; That was fine  with us who work there.&#160; </span></div></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><div>&#160;</div><hr /><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Thursday, October 11, 2012 at Focus &amp; on the  Front Lines</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I arrived at the center&#160;right after the&#160;Mass, at  the Sacred Heart Cathedral, around 12:50pm.&#160; I greeted Martha, in the parking  lot, for she had just arrived to the center.&#160; When I got into Focus there were  people in the Material Aid Room already, for Paul was there.&#160; Sheila wasn't  there, on the front lines,&#160;today.&#160; I then went out to the&#160;sidewalk, to speak to  the four people that were out there.&#160; I invited two of them to come to Focus for  a tour when they were done praying.&#160; They agreed.&#160; I then said "good bye" to  them all &amp; then went back into the center.&#160; I did some work &amp; then Tim  came with a nice stroller, which was taken hours later on.&#160; Thanks Tim for  everything that you &amp; Molly bless us with, for our clients.&#160; Then Tim &amp;  Paul went to lunch together.&#160; Suzanne came &amp; Dr. Karen, is out of town, this  week.&#160; After 2pm the two ladies came into Focus for a tour.&#160; The mother is  planning to come to volunteer.&#160; I hope that she will come soon to help us.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was now about 2:10pm &amp; I left the center to go out to join Martha  out on the front lines.&#160; The three men were there across the street praying the  Rosary.&#160; When the two men&#160;were done they came over to talk with Martha &amp; I,  for a few minutes, before leaving.&#160; Adolf stays until 4pm.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the cars were coming into Planned Parenthood &amp; some were coming  out.&#160; How&#160;sad is it to see them coming in to have their precious baby be killed  in there &amp; then a couple of hours later coming out&#160;after they had done it.&#160;  It's so very, very hard to be out there. on the sidewalk, experiencing this  horror.&#160; Martha had to go into the center &amp; now I was alone on the sidewalk  by Planned Parenthood when a car had come down the street with the passenger  half way out of the car almost on top of the roof saying not so nice things to  me.&#160; I replied back to him saying "I love you &amp; God loves you &amp; repent  of your sins".&#160; Lord have mercy on him.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The fingers go up &amp; the words come down on us all afternoon but then  there is the sweetness of others, that pass us by.&#160; It makes the pain more  tolerable, to bear.&#160; &#160;I feel that most of them are post abortive &amp; are  suffering with the pain of having an abortion&#160;or being involved with the  abortion decision, of a woman or young girl.&#160; It's such a heartache for those  who did this horrific act against their baby :(&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">John came by &amp; he prayed with Martha.&#160; I continued to sidewalk  counsel.&#160;One of our clients came by to show me the ultrasound picture of her  baby.&#160; How sweet was that :)&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was now about 5:30pm &amp; we went into the center.&#160; John had now left  to go catch the bus.&#160;Martha &amp; I ate quickly &amp; then&#160;Faye &amp; Natalie,  from JUST ME,&#160;came to help us out.&#160; After they were done working in the Material  Aid Room we all&#160;sat down to talk.&#160;It was wonderful!!&#160;</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span></div></font></div></span></span></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /></span></span><div><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Tuesday, October 16, 2012 at Focus</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I arrived to the enter after the noon  Mass today.&#160; We got to complete some tasks before the doorbell started to ring.&#160;  Paul came around 1:30pm to help us out!!&#160;&#160; I got to do some work that I needed  to do, so I felt good about that.&#160; We&#160;had a delivery of a bag of stuffed animals  for our clients children.&#160; It was now about 2:30pm &amp; Martha came into the  office to tell me that she was going outside now.&#160; She took what she needed  &amp; out the door she went.&#160; I wanted to join her but the doorbell kept on  ringing.&#160; Then Cleveland, our street person,&#160;came by so Paul got him something  to eat.&#160;&#160;Cleveland then resided along the Buckpitt building, which is right next  door, to our center.&#160; It was now about&#160;4:15pm &amp; I was able to get outside to  join Martha.&#160; I turned the corner to see that Martha was talking to John C.  outside.&#160; She told me of some of the things that went on out there.&#160; One young  girl was with an older man &amp; she came over to Martha &amp; asked for the  packet.&#160; Martha handed it to her &amp; then she walked away.&#160;We continued to be  out there on the front lines&#160;then we went back into the center.&#160; John had left  to catch the bus to go home.&#160; Martha &amp; I had supper &amp; then went  home.</span></div></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Wednesday, October 17, 2012 at Focus</font></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> <br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I got to Focus after Mass today.&#160; Martha went to  take a friend, to the dentist, &amp; then out to lunch.&#160; I went over to talk to  Rick, who was standing, by Planned Parenthood.&#160; Then I saw a woman, who was  pushing a double stroller into the center, so I went over to open the door for  her.&#160; She was the grandmother who takes care of her grandchildren while her  daughter goes to work.&#160; She brought them into the Material Aid Room &amp;  shopped around for about 15 minutes &amp;&#160;then left.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it  was Jeremy who delivers bread &amp; canned foods, for our food cabinet.&#160; He  delivered 3 large boxes of bread &amp; some used clothes for our clients  children.&#160; After he left the doorbell rang again &amp; it was the volunteers,  who work at St. Pius the Tenth, delivering the non perishable food items.&#160; They  dropped off at least 10 bags that were full of food.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; Then there  was Tim who came by &amp; dropped off toys &amp; bags of shoes &amp; used  clothes, for the center.&#160; He stayed to help us out with other things.&#160; Thanks  Tim for everything!!&#160; Then Martha came &amp; so did Paul.&#160; What a team!!&#160; We all  worked hard.&#160; Then a little while later Lynda came to join Martha, who told me  that she wanted to go outside to pray.&#160; About an hour later Martha came back  into the center &amp; so did Lynda.&#160; In the meantime Linda came by to help us  put away the donations that we just received from the Second Thought, the second  hand store, in East Rochester.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">About a hour later the doorbell rang &amp; it was  Mike, who was dropping off some wonderfully homemade items, like hats, scarves,  toys, for our clients &amp; for their children.&#160; Wow!!&#160; Ironically he knew Lynda  &amp; her husband,&#160; Such a small world!&#160; <br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The 4 students, from the Elim Bible Institute, came  to help us out today.&#160; They come every Wednesday from 4:30pm to 6:30pm.&#160; One  girl worked making up the Truth packets &amp; the other two girls folded up the  clothes in the baskets in the Material Aid Room.&#160;They all did a great job!! </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br /></span></div></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></div><hr /></span></span><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Thursday, October 18, 2012 at Focus &amp;

formula.&#160; Thank God that we had the  right baby formula for her precious baby girl.&#160; Just as I was finishing up with  her Karen arrived.&#160; We spent a few minutes looking over an Intake Sheet, for our  clients, that are sent over to Embracing Options, for an ultrasound on Wednesday  afternoons.&#160;&#160;The Intake Sheet&#160;looked a little intense so I'm not sure what the  final answer will be for this 'new' document.&#160; Karen had just returned from a 9  day convention in another state, learning about the Creighton Method of Natural  Family Planning, which is for just married couples &amp; is approved by the  Catholic Church.&#160; This method has NO pills, shots, devices or plugs that are  inserted in the arms of the woman.&#160;This is a great!&#160; &#160;She said that the long  week was very educational.&#160; Karen had to leave early today, for she had to take  her daughter &amp; friends, to Buffalo.&#160; Suzanne arrived but she had to leave  early today to go to the doctors.&#160; At least this week, for the first time in  about&#160;five or more months, everyone was there at Focus.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha wasn't there yet so I started to think of  where she could be, so I called her &amp; got her voice message &amp; left a  message.&#160; She called me back about 20 minutes later to say that she was at her  apartment, along with her pregnant daughter, killing bugs which were in her  apartment.&#160; Sorry about that dear Martha.&#160;For she doesn't like the bugs that  were there. &#160;She came to the center about 30 minutes later.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I headed out to the front lines when Kathleen, came  for St. Louis Church.&#160; She let me use the mega phone &amp; the graphic sign.&#160;  This was wonderful for me &amp; I did appreciate it so much.&#160; She was so  receptive &amp; I was touched by her wisdom.&#160; I spoke to all the cars that  pulled into the Killing Mill Planned Parenthood.&#160; Later on Martha came out to  join us &amp; then John arrived &amp; then Lynda came.&#160; We had Dan &amp; Adolf  across the street praying the Rosary.&#160; Very effective.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't be sure, but I don't think that any  precious baby was saved.&#160;there this afternoon.&#160; &#160;How sad!<font face="Arial">&#160; </font>When I finally did go into the center around 5:45pm  ,Paul was still there, in the center.&#160; He told Martha &amp; I some jokes &amp;  then left after his work was done.&#160; Just before he left Donna &amp; her two  girls arrived to the center.&#160; I was so surprised &amp; happy to see her &amp;  the children.&#160; Martha was just serving supper so we offered them some but Donna  said that they were having a barbecue at their house later on.&#160; We talked &amp;  shared &amp; set up a supper time at a restaurant at Panorama Plaza at 5:30pm  tomorrow.&#160; Can't wait.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Tuesday, October 23, 2012 at Focus</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp;

I had an appointment with Joan, the new director at the Women's Care  Center, this afternoon.&#160; We went over many things to better both pregnancy  centers.&#160;&#160;I will call, at least 4 local organizations, to see what their  affiliation is with Planned Parenthood, hopefully none at all.&#160; It was nice  discussing these matters, with Joan, to try to get some things done in both  centers.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">St. Pius the Tenth Church had delivered,&#160;more food  bags, for us to hand out to our clients.&#160;We thank  them so very much for all that they do for Focus.&#160; Jerry came with some  donations that were a sure give away.&#160; Paul had come to help us out today by  cleaning our donations &amp; helping our moms with diapers &amp; wipes.&#160; He was  in a 'good mood' for he found about <span style="font-family: Tahoma;">seven</span> DVD's of the old hit TV series, The  Rifleman.&#160; I hope that he will enjoy them.&#160; Ni, our client advocate on  Mondays,&#160;had them by the door, to be put in the dumpster, but Paul found them  &amp; took them home.&#160; He was so happy :) <br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp;

She is a trooper!!&#160; I started to talk to the people that were driving  into the abortion mill by telling them the truth.&#160; Later this evening a car came  into the driveway &amp; I started to talk to the young girl &amp; guy, who had  now parked but didn't get outside of the car.&#160; It was about 5 minutes later that  I saw that the car was coming out of the driveway with just only the same two  people that went into the parking lot.&#160; I was very happy to see this situation.&#160;  I can only hope &amp; pray that they both had changed their minds for having  their precious baby be killed but she will deliver her son or daughter sometime  next year !!&#160; Thank you Lord!!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I spoke with a man, who was on his cell phone,  being preoccupied with his conversation.&#160; I told him that nothing was more  important then to save his child from being killed in there.&#160; He just ignored me  &amp; then went back into&#160;Planned Parenthood.&#160; It was quite awhile later that  they both came out of the building &amp; she drove out.&#160; I was hoping that she  didn't have an abortion but when she had stopped the car to look in both  directions I saw that she was wearing a while wrist band, so I started to direct  the comments about abortion to them both.&#160; Lord, I do hope that she didn't have  their baby killed here today.&#160; He said something nasty to me so I asked him to  stop using his phone so much &amp; if she had an abortion here today he is also  responsible for the murder.&#160; Good Bye!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">People were driving into the parking lot to pick up  the victims of abortion.&#160; But the real victim is the baby that was murdered.&#160;  The regular abortionist wasn't here today but someone was in there doing this  Evil......</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">John C.,&#160;had now arrived on the sidewalk,&#160;so he  &amp; Martha talked &amp; then prayed together.&#160; Then John A.,came with a pizza,  like he said he was going to do.&#160; He was dropped off by the taxi to the  pregnancy center.&#160; I called Dan over to tell him about the pizza, so he could  get some.&#160; Dan went into the center to get a piece of pizza.&#160; The other 'prayer  guys' already had&#160;left.&#160; So Martha, John &amp; I stayed outside for about an  hour more &amp; then they went into Focus, to eat.&#160; I stayed outside about 30  minutes more &amp; then I went into the center.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">It was around 6:30pm when Faye &amp; Natalie from  JustMe Ministry came into the center to assist Martha &amp; I with the inside  work.&#160; They worked in the Material Aid Room for about an hour &amp; then we all  sat around the table, in the Green Room,&#160;&amp; shared.&#160; They are soooo nice!!&#160;</span></div></span></div></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div><hr /></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;Gr<font face="Arial">ea</font>t info that I want to share:</span></span></div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Hello Rick,</span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Monday  afternoon shortly after 5:00 pm, October 22, three of us (Jim Burke,  Randy Smith, and myself) were praying on the sidewalk near Planned  Parenthood as part of the 40 Days for life campaign.&#160; A young  African-American woman with her baby son in a stroller approached us.&#160;  She&#160;had just been at Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; She thanked us for  being there praying on the sidewalk and told us we were doing a good  thing.&#160; She said that about one year ago she had been scheduled for an  abortion at Planned Parenthood when she saw pro-lifers praying in front  of the clinic.&#160; She pointed to the 40 Days for&#160;Life signs and said that  the pro-lifers she had seen had been holding&#160;them.&#160; She couldn't go  through with her  abortion.&#160; She was only 16 at the time and she said that her boyfriend  and her mother continued to pressure her to have an abortion, especially  because of how young she was.&#160; They even later on drove her to Buffalo  for a later-term abortion but again she refused.&#160; She was able to have  her son and was able to get support from the pregnancy center.&#160; She also  told us that&#160;after her son was born, her family changed their attitude  and now are supportive.&#160; She also&#160;said that she had become born again,  giving her life to Jesus,&#160;and&#160;was not being sexually active anymore,  determined to wait until&#160;her upcoming marriage which was to be in  March.&#160; She again thanked us for being there and was so grateful that  the public witness of pro-lifers praying that day one year before helped  her to be strong enough to do what was right and protect the life  of&#160;her son.&#160; We were all uplifted by her kind words and  it was&#160;great to see&#160;one concrete example of the results of all  the&#160;sacrificial prayer and witness of those&#160;participating in the 40 Days  for Life.</span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Rob</span></span></span></div><hr /><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Tuesday, October 30, 2012 at Focus</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp;

so was I.&#160; Sandy, one of our  volunteers, came into the center with a multi colored wig on her head.&#160; She said  that she was a clown.&#160; Okay dear Sandy.&#160; She helped out in the Material Aid Room  putting things away in there.&#160; Then Linda came with her daughter Lisa, they both  want to volunteer at Focus.&#160; Yeah.&#160; Linda went outside to pay &amp; to witness  &amp; Lisa stayed in the center &amp; I orientated her some what.&#160; A little at a  time.&#160; She was putting away our new non perishable food items that were brought  to us earlier by the husband &amp; wife team at St. Pius the Tenth Church, when  5 people wanted food as they came into the center.&#160; It was now busy again.&#160;&#160;We  never know when this surge will happen.&#160; Then Linda came back into Focus so I  spoke with her for awhile before mother &amp; daughter had to leave.&#160; We will  see Lisa tomorrow as our 'new' volunteer.&#160; Linda will start next Wednesday.&#160;  Yeah!!&#160; Thank you dear Lord for answering my prayer, for more people to help us  out, at Focus.&#160; I do appreciate this so very much!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I received a phone call from one of the Elim  Students saying that they couldn't make it this evening.&#160;

She was just finishing the Intake Sheet of a client that she just had  seen.&#160; This client earlier,&#160;was walking into Planned Parenthood for an  ultrasound, &amp; then for the Abortion Pill afterwards.&#160; Dr. Joe &amp; his wife  Maureen were standing there on the sidewalk for the '40 Days for Life' team, he  &amp; she also spoke with this client.&#160; Sheila brought her &amp; her friend into  Focus where she asked her to fill out an Intake Sheet &amp;&#160;she spoke&#160;with her  about her life giving options, either to parent or go through the adoption  process.&#160; Sheila, also gave her some literature,&#160;for her benefit.&#160;Later on today  Suzanne, our client advocate,&#160;gave this client a call about an&#160;ultrasound  appointment &amp; left that message on her voice mail.&#160;

Karen came into the center to help us out for two hours.&#160; I  spoke with her about the ultrasound program, I had some questions for her.&#160; I  had the hard copies, on my desk,&#160;that were just sent to&#160;me by Jann.&#160;&#160;I need more  clarification when it comes our way.&#160;

Last  week he had a stranger get in his car to take him to the drug store, for  some&#160;medicine.&#160; I was not happy with his decision but he did it anyway.&#160; The guy  took his $100 bill &amp; left the car &amp; never came back with the change, for  his so called medicine, from the store.&#160; Why on earth did Adolf give this guy a  $100 bill &amp; thought that he would come back with the change is very hard to  believe.&#160; Poor Adolf he wishes that he never did that, last week, &amp; he'll  never do it again.&#160; Then on top of that he got a speeding ticket too.&#160; Poor  wonderful Adolf, such a kind man :)&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I continued to sidewalk counsel &amp; to pray.&#160; Cars coming in  &amp; out of the abortion mill &amp; precious babies being slaughtered, one  after&#160;another.&#160; How horrible is this!!!&#160; It was about 3:30pm &amp; Paul came  outside &amp; told me that our new volunteer Lisa had her cell phone stolen.&#160; I  went back into the center to see what had happened.&#160; Lisa had her purse in the  Green Room &amp; one of our longest clients, who was the only person in the  Great Room at the time, apparently took the cell phone from Lisa's purse.&#160; How  bad is this!&#160; Lisa was on the phone canceling her minutes to the stolen  phone....great idea.&#160; I told her that we would pay for a new phone but she said  "no".&#160; I then said to her that when you come back, next Tuesday, just put your  purse in the office behind the desk.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; I spoke with  Martha, later on, &amp; we both decided that it would be best not to have&#160;Donna  back inside the center ever again.&#160; My heart hurts for Lisa.&#160; <font size="2"><font face="Arial">W</font></font>e can't have&#160;stealing, in our pregnancy center<font size="2"><font face="Arial">!!</font></font></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span></div></font></div></span></div></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tuesday, November 6, 2012 at Focus</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We were very busy at Focus today.&#160;

We had donations to put away so she helped  with that.&#160; Linda, our volunteer came early today so she helped put away the  clothes into the Material Aid Room.&#160; I worked in the office &amp; Martha worked  with Lisa &amp; Linda.&#160; The doorbell still doesn't work so Martha had called our  landlord Bernie to see what was happening with that problem.&#160; He said that he  would bring a new battery as soon as he could to fix the doorbell.&#160;

I that her daughter Lisa, our new volunteer wasn't going to be able  to come in tomorrow for her was sick.&#160; Also, so was her father Bill, he was sick  too.&#160; Lynda dropped off some clothes for one of our clients to have.&#160; How nice  was that...&#160; Lynda couldn't stay today either for she had to go back home to  take care of your family who were not feeling to well.&#160; We hope &amp; pray that  all will be well with them.&#160; (Friday I received a call from Lynda that her  husband Bill's mother had died &amp; that Lisa, nor&#160;her,&#160;could come to Focus the  following week, to volunteer,&#160;for they all had to go out of town for the funeral  Mass.&#160;

the two Elim students had  just arrived to help us out, in the center.&#160; Leaha wasn't with them today.&#160; I  put the two girls to work. I asked Ruth to complete the 'Food Pantry List', so  that we were sure of the information that we had on the referral&#160;page, that we  hand out to our clients, for their needs to be met in the community.&#160; She typed  the update list&#160;&amp; I made&#160;copies, to put into the Material Aid Room &amp; the  Counseling Room, for our clients.&#160; Great job Ruth &amp; I have other referral  lists to complete too, probably next week.&#160; Zion, was helping Martha out with  the donations, &amp; she was very helpful with her project.&#160; We are so blessed  with all the help our Elim Bible Students give us!&#160; Thank you  Lord!!&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I received a call from Faye, one of the two women  from the JustMe Ministry, that come to Focus twice a month to help us out.&#160; She  said that she had hurt her back &amp; that Natalie, the other woman, were not  able to come tomorrow but will come the following Thursday to volunteer.&#160; I said  that was okay &amp; I hope that you will be feeling better soon.&#160;  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Thursday, November 8, 2012 on the Front  Lines</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I got to the center right after the noon Mass at  the Cathedral.&#160; I was surprised that Martha was already there, for she had to  take her friend to the doctors &amp; I thought she'd be here later. I was so  happy that I was wrong.&#160;&#160; She had a quick lunch &amp; then went out to the front  lines while I stayed in the center until all was settled.&#160; Julie will be coming,  in a few minutes, to be orientated some more. Julie, is our newest volunteer,  &amp; she will open up Focus&#160;at 9am&#160;until 1pm &amp; then Martha &amp; I will be  there until 8pm, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays &amp; Thursdays.&#160; This is wonderful!!&#160;  Thank you Lord, for we have been praying for more volunteers, &amp; you have  blessed us with them.&#160; Karen, came in with bags of winter clothes, that she's  been storing in her home.&#160; She's now taking our summer bags to store for next  year.&#160; This has been such a great help to us.&#160; Julie had just came into the  center.&#160; I spoke with her for a short time then I took her to the counseling  room for more orientation.&#160; Suzanne just arrived &amp; she had meet Julie  already from a protest at the Unitarian church about two years ago.&#160; What a  memory you have Suzanne!!&#160; I think that Julie felt very comfortable.&#160; I just  received a phone call from Jennifer who was outside with Martha.&#160; She had said  that she was walking with a sign up &amp; down on the sidewalk &amp; she said  that a man named&#160; Eric told her that she could not walk in the buffer zone, for  it was in the Injunction papers.&#160; She mentioned to him to show her the  Injunction, to which he said nothing back to her.&#160;She called me up asking me  what she should do.&#160; I said for her not to go into the buffer zone.&#160; She said  "okay".&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I now had to go outside to be with&#160;Martha, so I  said "good bye" to all &amp; then went to the front lines.&#160; As I was walking  outside I saw Jennifer, walking into the parking lot, so we talked for a few  minutes about what had just happened.&#160; She understood the situation but, as we,  she didn't like it either. She left but I'm sure that she will be back out on  the front lines next week.&#160; I can only hope &amp; pray that she will.&#160; I then  met up with Martha.&#160;She told me that the man&#160;who parked in front of Buckpitt  said to Jennifer that he had his four babies be killed by abortion &amp; then he  walked over to the condos that were being built across the street.&#160; My heart was  so sad that he felt no remorse for what he had done to his four children. Lord  have mercy on his soul &amp; for the souls of the woman or women that took their  lives.&#160;I then saw that Adolf, was standing across the street by himself, holding  his sign.&#160;Dan &amp; Addison didn't make it today on the sidewalk.&#160;It was again  horrible to be there where little precious babies were being murdered, by the  abortionist, through their own mothers &amp; sometimes fathers.&#160; Not all men  want their baby to be killed.&#160; They have NO power to stop it.&#160; It ALL depends on  the mother.........</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">John, from the '40 Days for Life',&#160; which is now  finished this year,&#160;came walking down the sidewalk.&#160; We were so happy to see him  approach us.&#160; We greeted him &amp; then Martha &amp; John said the Rosary &amp;  the Divine Mercy prayers together.&#160;The power of prayer!!&#160; After their prayers  Martha went back into the center to help out another client with clothes for her  family &amp; John &amp; I stayed out, on the front lines, a little longer.&#160; Then  I saw a young man, who was walking from where the condos were, heading towards  the car&#160;to which I was told about earlier.&#160; As he came closer to us he said  "well is it time to unload".&#160; I then spoke to him bluntly but with love.&#160; I had  asked him if he had been involved with four abortions &amp; he answered me back  that he did &amp; then he started to say more when I told him to now listen to  me.&#160; I said&#160;"you are heading for Hell unless you ask God, with a sincere heart,  to forgive you for taking four lives".&#160; He tried to talk to me but his face was  changing into a harden face.&#160; He then got into his car. He drove his car, making  a circle, so that he could pass me by. He&#160;then made a face, from Hell, as he  drove away.&#160; I will pray for his soul.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A car did come in later on this afternoon &amp;  went into the parking lot &amp; they stayed in the car for less than 5 minutes  &amp; then they left Planned Parenthood.&#160;No one got out of the car or into the  car while they we there. &#160;Praise God!</span></span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">John helped me bring&#160;everything into the center.&#160; I  was grateful for his&#160;help for he can't see very well &amp; he is an older  gentleman too but very sufficient.&#160; He stayed for a very short time then left to  catch the bus.&#160; We hope to see him next Thursday again.&#160; Martha finished our  work &amp; then had supper.&#160; She left early tonight, for she was going to go to  St.Jude's Holy Hour, which has resumed.&#160; Praise God for that!!&#160;  &#160;&#160; <br /></span></div></span></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tuesday, November 13, 2012 at Focus</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I know that Tuesdays are our most busy afternoon  &amp; it was that way today again.&#160; Martha &amp; I saw 13 people even more for  not everyone signs in the book in the Material Aid Room, unfortunately.&#160; When we  fist arrived we saw that Donna was in the parking lot.&#160; Martha had parked closer  to her than I so when she got out of the car it was Martha who approached her  first.&#160; She told me late what she had said to Donna.&#160; She approached her gently  &amp; said "Donna you're not allowed in Focus I just what you to pray &amp; we  will continue to pray for a result in this matter".&#160; She said "okay" &amp;  walked away.&#160; Martha &amp; I felt badly about this but we had no other choice.&#160;  If she did take Lisa's cell phone, then we can't have her in Focus, that's the  way it is.&#160; Sometimes we have to do the hardest things to protect our clients  &amp; staff.&#160; So now Martha &amp; I were both in the center starting to put  things away.&#160; Then we saw Bernie, our landlord &amp; I thanked him for repairing  the doorbell.&#160; I even think that it sounds better than the last doorbell ring.&#160;  Yeah!!&#160; Then Frank came to get his money from Bernie because he had painted the  front room that's now for rent.&#160; We pray that it will be the right person.&#160; I  then went to my car to get some things from it &amp; I bumped into Jennifer.&#160;  She told me that she had some boots for Cleveland, our street friend,&#160;to wear in  the winter &amp; then she went over to her car &amp; gave them to me to take  into Focus.&#160; I thanked her for her kindness &amp; generosity to him.&#160; I then  told Martha about the boots &amp; she put them on the shelf in the hallway.&#160; We  haven't seen him in over a week so we hope that he's okay.&#160; After that I went to  the kitchenette to start to make our chicken sandwiches for lunch then the  doorbell rang.&#160; Martha went to the door to answer it.&#160; She was now in the  counseling room &amp; was preparing for a pregnancy test.&#160; A few minutes later  there was two young women in the Green Room where I was preparing lunch.&#160; I  continued then I started to speak to them.&#160; They had gone into Planned  Parenthood this afternoon &amp; when they did the woman at the front desk asked  her if she wanted an abortion.&#160; She said "no, I just want a pregnancy test".&#160;  The woman said back to her that Planned Parenthood doesn't do walk in's at this  time.&#160; So when they left they were approached by Jennifer who lead them to  Focus, which they were happy about.&#160; They had to wait for awhile for Martha was  busy in the counseling room but it was time for them to go in.&#160; She was negative  &amp; surprised.&#160; She didn't feel well &amp; wanted to go to Anthony Jordan's  Health Clinic.&#160; Martha asked me if Focus could pay for her taxi to the clinic.&#160;  I said yes but just to the center &amp; not from the center to their homes.&#160;  They understood &amp; said "thank you".&#160; I called the taxi man &amp; then while  they were waiting we talked more.&#160; The young woman has may issues &amp; her life  is a mess but she doesn't really 'get it'.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that she does real  soon.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">We knew today that we weren't going to get any  volunteer help.&#160; Julie was with her parents at her grandmother's funeral, in  another state &amp; Linda was down near New York City, with her daughter that  just had her precious baby.&#160; So Martha &amp; I were very busy.&#160; Then the  doorbell rang &amp; rang &amp; rang again.&#160; Later on Martha did two more  pregnancy tests.&#160; The good news was that they all were negative!!&#160; </span></div></span></span></div></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">Wednesday, November 14, 2012 at Focus</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160; <br /><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I had been invited,&#160;by Maria,&#160;to speak about the  Focus Pregnancy help Center at a Bible Study women's group at St. Joseph's  Church in Penfield this morning.&#160; I did enjoy meeting the ladies &amp; speaking  about the history of Focus.&#160; It was a well participated group with some of them  sharing about their own experiences&#160;with abortion.&#160; They also had blessed us  with diapers, baby wipes &amp; baby formula, how nice was that!!&#160;&#160;Their  kindness&#160;was well appreciated.&#160; After the talk was over I went to T-Mobile to  get some more minutes for the Focus cell phone &amp; then went to Mass at  12:10pm.&#160; After Mass Martha &amp; I went to Focus for the afternoon &amp;  evening to work.&#160; We were doing things in the center &amp; one of them was that  Martha was making us lunch.&#160; Before we sat down for a quick sandwich the  doorbell rang.&#160; It was our grandmother with her grand children who she takes  care of.&#160; She was happy with what she received in the Material Aid Room &amp;  then left.&#160; Martha &amp; I then went to the table &amp; sat down to eat our egg  salad sandwich when the door bell rang.&#160; I got up to answer it.&#160; At the door was  Jerry delivering 4 big boxes of bread for our clients.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I greeted him  &amp; the he brought in the boxes.&#160; I then called Tim, for the had asked me to,  &amp; he said that he was on his way to Focus.&#160; He came about 10 minutes later  to get a box of bread for his family &amp; friends.&#160; He also did some other  things to help us out.&#160; After Jerry &amp; Tim had left we went back to the table  to finish our lunch.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again &amp; again &amp; again.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Martha did&#160;4 pregnancy tests today.&#160; All clients were negative but&#160;Martha  had to counsel them in their life situations, which takes time.&#160; She was very  tired at the end of this day.&#160; Paul was having car problems so he wasn't with us  &amp; we felt that loss.&#160; We finally got to sit back down to have supper about  6:30pm &amp; that was great!&#160; </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;

household items at a  church on East Ave..&#160; So I had to go into the office to get the forms to fill  out &amp; to give them to the women.&#160; Thank God that Paul was already here &amp;  then Martha came into the center, so I felt better.&#160; She then went out to the  front lines for I told her that I had to orientate Julie some more this  afternoon.&#160; Karen had called me earlier this morning telling me that she  wouldn't be at the center today for she had to go to an appointment.&#160; Julie, our  new volunteer, just arrived.&#160; I greeted her &amp; then took her from one room to  another taking about what usually goes on in each room.&#160; She is so nice &amp;  receptive to all the information that I bombarded her with.&#160; Suzanne had now  arrived, to work in the office.&#160; I felt better, knowing the center was staffed  sufficiently, when I finally went out to the front lines at 2:10pm to join  Martha.&#160; When I did join her she was by herself on the sidewalk with Adolf on  the other side of the street.&#160; WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE!!!&#160; I just don't get it!!!&#160;  We need more people to be more effective to save lives.&#160; Lord please have Mercy  on us all.&#160; Thank God that we do have many people that are our benefactors &amp;  prayer partners but where are the other people that go to different churches on  Sunday??&#160; Why are they not out here to defend like?&#160; I have to just go on  without an answer.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The cars kept coming in &amp; going out of Planned  Parenthood, all afternoon.&#160; I always say when they leave the parking lot to  "repent of the murder of your precious baby", or something like that, so that  someday they will repent of this crime against their own son or daughter &amp;  to save their souls from Hell.&#160; I hope that they will remember the Lord words  through me.&#160; The Holy Spirit will help them to remember.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">John came around 4:30pm so Martha &amp; him said  the Rosary &amp; the Divine Mercy Prayer to help save lives &amp; souls.&#160; Then  after the prayers Martha went into the center &amp; there helped a mom get what  she needed for her family.&#160; John &amp; I stayed out there for a little while  longer.&#160; As we were getting ready to leave I saw a police car drive into the  Planned Parenthood's parking lot &amp; then another police car came a few  minutes&#160;later.&#160; I knew that they know where the pregnancy center was if they  wanted to talk to me or talk to me when I'm still out&#160;there but I knew that I  didn't come against anyone today so I really didn't think that I was involved  with the police today.&#160;&#160;When I came back outside from the center where we store  all our signs that I was putting away I saw one of the policeman driving out of  the killing mill &amp; he waved at me.&#160; I just looked at him &amp; waved back to  him.&#160; Then I looked into the parking lot again &amp; I saw an Ambulance that was  parked further up the driveway.&#160; It was hard to spot but I did, through the  grace of God.&#160; I then waited by the&#160;fence on the sidewalk to see what was going  to happen.&#160; I got my cell phone out of my pocket &amp; was ready to take  pictures as the ambulance left.&#160; While I was waiting,&#160;the car of the smiley  young woman who always smiles at me &amp; waves as she drives into this place of  horror, was driving out.&#160; I took my camera &amp; took her picture.&#160; She wasn't  smiling anymore.&#160; She got her camera phone ready &amp; took my picture too.&#160; As  she was leaving I said to her "thanks for the picture" &amp; waved at her.&#160;  Maybe she won't be back again.&#160; I can only hope.&#160; About 5 minutes later the  stretcher came out with a young Afro-American girl on it.&#160; The two attendants  took her to the Ambulance &amp; drove out.&#160; As the Ambulance was leaving I  called out to her&#160;saying that I will be praying for her.&#160; I did take three  pictures too.&#160; Only God knows what had happened to her.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I now went back into Focus &amp; told Martha all  that went on.&#160; John said "good bye" &amp; went to reach a bus to go home.&#160;  Martha&#160;&amp; I worked in the center until supper time.&#160; Faye &amp; Natalie came  to&#160;volunteer with us around 5:45pm tonight.&#160; After their work was done,&#160;we all  sat down at the table, to share.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tuesday, November 20, 2012 at Focus</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I knew that we would be busy, on this  Tuesday,&#160;&amp; we were.&#160; We saw a total of 16 people this day.&#160; Martha was with  her friend taking her to the doctors so I wasn't sure when she would be at  Focus, this afternoon.&#160; When I first arrived at the center I started my work  then the doorbell rang &amp; it continued all afternoon, which is what we want.&#160;  Thank God Paul came at 1pm so I felt better after Julie had left.&#160; Poor lady.&#160;  When she arrived she fist put out the A-Frame sign &amp; then went on to open  all the rooms but had a horrible time opening the Pregnancy Testing Room.&#160; She  called me but she didn't let the phone ring enough so I didn't talk with her so  she called Martha &amp; she did.&#160; She asked Martha what she should do if someone  comes into the center for a pregnancy test &amp; she can't get into the room to  do it.&#160; Martha told her that we had some pregnancy tests in the office &amp;  also the Intake Sheets too, if she needed them.&#160; She said that the doorbell was  ringing so she had to go.&#160; Julie told me that the woman at the door was a  pregnancy test &amp; she was ready to give it with what Martha had just told  her.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; She finally got the Pregnancy Testing Room door opened, after the  client left.&#160; She was relieved!&#160; Sorry about that dear Julie :(&#160; She wrote down all  her questions so that I could answer them.&#160; Great idea!&#160; Otherwise she had a  great FIRST DAY at Focus !!!!&#160; See you tomorrow Julie.....</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was Valerie.&#160; I was  happy to see her come in to help us with the work.&#160; She greeted Paul &amp; then  went to the Material Aid Room to assist the clients that were in there.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then Julie came into the center.&#160; I greeted her  &amp; was happy to see her back after losing her grandmother, last week.&#160; I  brought her into the office &amp; told her that I would like for her to work on  updating our Focus Brochure.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; She sat down at the desk  &amp; we started working on this project.&#160; It was about 10 minutes later that a  young girl came walking into the office asking for a STD test.&#160; I said that we  don't do them but I know who does &amp; I called Dee at Embracing Options &amp;  she said to have her come on over.&#160; I said "thank you" &amp; hung up.&#160; I told  this young girl &amp; she was upset because she didn't know how to get there.&#160; I  went over to the taxi office but no one was there so I was just about to call  them when Lisa said that she would be happy to drive her there.&#160; I said that  would be fine.&#160; She didn't know how to get there so she went to the computer  &amp; got directions on Mapquest.&#160; The young lady asked what we do so I gave her  our Truth packet &amp; our brochure &amp; a DVD.&#160; She was happy with all of that  &amp; off they went.&#160; Lisa came back about a half an hour later &amp; I was  relieved.&#160; We then continued our work on the brochure.&#160; What a project, this was  especially difficult for Lisa.&#160; She wasn't familiarized with our old program but  she worked for almost 3 hours without complaint.&#160; You go girl!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We had one client that stayed for hours.&#160; I got to  talk with her for a very short time.&#160; She is the friend of the woman that&#160;we  called the taxi for last week to go the Jordan Health Clinic.&#160; She has many  children so she took many bags of things for her family.&#160; I hope all is okay at  home for she is a married woman.&#160; She got to spend some time with Valerie which  I was happy about.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I heard Paul say "hi Martha" so I went to the  hall to greet her.&#160; After I did I saw that she had brought Mary Lou with her  from the doctors.&#160; I greeted her &amp; talked with her for a short time.&#160; She  was feeling a little dizzy so wanted to go home after a half hour.&#160; I said "good  bye" &amp; Martha left to take Mary Lou home.&#160; But before this happened Martha  did a pregnancy test, which was negative.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Lisa did a fantastic job on the Focus Brochure  &amp; she made a copy of it.&#160; Looks &amp; reads great.&#160; I am so&#160;happy with all  the new changes.&#160; Thank you dear Lord for&#160;Lisa!!&#160; &#160;&#160;Lisa had to go &amp; it was  now&#160;5:30pm.&#160; We'll see her next week to help&#160;us with more things in the  center.&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was Linda.&#160; She is a new  grandmother!&#160; Yeah!!&#160; She brought in some pictures of Grayson Michael, who was  born 10 lbs., last week.&#160; Wow young man!!&#160; &#160;The parents &amp; grandparents  are&#160;so delighted &amp; so are we.&#160; Praise God!&#160; Then one of the clients, who was  in the Material Aid Room, just told us that she delivered her daughter Princess  on&#160;November 1st.&#160;&amp; she was 11 lbs.&#160; Wow young lady!!&#160;&#160; Two big babies :)&#160;  Linda helped Martha with putting away the donations &amp; Paul &amp; Valerie had  just left.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">After everyone had left Martha made supper &amp;&#160;we ate &amp;

Jerry came with 3 boxes of  bread, from his ministry.&#160; After he left I called Tim to tell him that we now  have bread.&#160; He came over to pick up some of the bread for his family &amp;  friends.&#160; The rest we put into the Material Aid Room for our clients.&#160; It is  always a blessing for them &amp; their families.&#160; The doorbell started to ring  so we were starting to assist our clients now.&#160; I knew that the&#160;three Elim  students weren't coming today so I started the office work.&#160; Martha &amp; Paul  were busy with the clients &amp; the donations, to put away.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha did a pregnancy test &amp; thank God that it  was negative for she had had two abortions &amp; was 17 years old.&#160; Lord have  Mercy on our young girls.&#160; Why did this happen?&#160; Why wasn't anyone there who  could have talked her out of this violence?&#160; Martha counseled her with the truth  &amp; gave her our Truth packet &amp; other informative brochures.&#160; I hope &amp;  pray that she will abstain from sex until she marries the right man.</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial"> </font>About 6:15pm Martha &amp;&#160;I had a nice supper &amp;

greeted Julie, our  newest volunteer.&#160; She said that she was busy this morning.&#160; I told her that now  when someone calls me I say that we are open from 9:30am to 6:30pm on Tuesdays,  Wednesdays &amp; Thursdays.&#160; She will be getting busier in time.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What a very busy day.&#160; Today we saw 23 clients that  came in to the center for assistance in the Material Aid Room.&#160; The two client  advocates did 4 pregnancy tests today.&#160; Julie did two &amp; Martha did two as  soon as she entered the center this afternoon.&#160; One of the girls will be  volunteering for 10 hours due to her class project.&#160; She will start soon.&#160; Then  another client came in &amp; asked if she could volunteer because the Dept. of  Social Services requested this of her.&#160; I told her that the young girl that came  in just before her asked &amp; I said "yes" to her but look around &amp; if you  can't find any place then come on back to us at Focus.&#160; She said "thanks, that  sounds good".&#160; She is a nice young lady we'll see what will happen.&#160; I did some  work while Martha was in the Counseling Room doing the pregnancy tests.&#160; After  she got out of the room I told her that I had to go to the Alternatives of  Battered Women to drop off a bag that was left at my door at home.&#160; I don't  know&#160;the person who dropped it off on the porch by my mailbox with a note on the  bag.&#160; As I was leaving to go out the doorbell rang.&#160; I saw that it was an older  man.&#160; I let him into the center &amp; asked him what I could do for him.&#160; He  said that he just wanted to know what we do here &amp; that he was 100% pro  life.&#160; I said that's great!!&#160; I took him around the center &amp; introduced him  to Martha.&#160; He asked me some questions &amp; I answered them for him.&#160; His name  is Neil &amp; is was so nice.&#160; I said for him to come back again to see us.&#160; He  agreed.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I left now to go do my errand.&#160; I arrived to my  destination &amp; dropped off the heavy bag.&#160; I hope all is well with this  mission.&#160; I then returned back to the center &amp; made a quick cheese sandwich  &amp; when I was almost done with it Julie came.&#160; She brought her laptop to do  work on the Focus brochure.&#160; She brought it into the Green Room where I was  eating to do the finishing touches on the brochure.&#160; She was going back &amp;  forth to the office &amp; the Green Room to finish the very important project.&#160;  I then called Rick, for him to check out the brochure.&#160; He emailed back about a  half an hour later saying that it printed out fine.&#160; Great news!!&#160; Thank you  Lord for sending us Lisa &amp; all our great volunteers at Focus!&#160; &#160;What a  team!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha told me two things.&#160; One was that Elroy, the  accountant, was now leaving.&#160; Friday will be his last day.&#160; Now we will have  back the men's bathroom &amp; we'll make it the Ladies Room &amp; our bathroom  will be the Men's Room.&#160; Something finally normal happening.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; The other  thing Martha told me was that she was outside on the front lines today at 10am  praying &amp; witnessing.&#160; She spoke with a woman who walked out of Planned  Parenthood &amp; she told Martha that she had had an Etopic pregnancy, a couple  of months ago, &amp; now was here for a pregnancy test.&#160;Planned Parenthood just  gave her a Depo shot saying to her that now you'll be sure not to get pregnant  so you can heal from the Etopic pregnancy.&#160; WHAT!!&#160; How evil they are.&#160; The Depo  shot is dangerous &amp; was not necessary for her or any female!!&#160; Martha gave  her our Truth packet &amp; other information.&#160; This woman was so sad that she  didn't know about us before she went into Planned Parenthood today.&#160; Now she  knows where we are located if she needs us.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul came &amp; cleaned the donations that I  brought in from Ana, in East Rochester.&#160; He was so busy but he enjoys the work.&#160;  Then later on Linda came in to volunteer.&#160; She &amp; Martha worked hard to try  to empty the Great Room where we put the donations.&#160; They did but then later on  a woman with her tow girls brought in two big bags of clothes for us to put  away.&#160; We'll save that project for tomorrow.&#160; Julie worked on other smaller  tasks in the office.&#160; She also likes what she<font face="Arial">'</font>s doing.&#160; Thank you Lord for  these happ<font face="Arial">y</font> camper's!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">Wednesday, November 28, 2012 at Focus</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was another very busy day at Focus.&#160; When we  arrived, after Mass, we noticed that the parking lot was filled with cars, which  was unusual because the two businesses, in the front offices, have left &amp;  the business for the taxi company is low so not to many people in that room  working.&#160; We got a spot each &amp; then went into the center.&#160; We both said "hi"  to Julie&#160;&amp; noticed that there were two women in the Material Aid Room  looking over the clothes for their children.&#160; The one young lady said "hi Miss  Mary", I said "hi" back.&#160; After Julie left Martha &amp; I got to work then the  doorbell rang.&#160; It was not as busy with the clients today as yesterday but it  was still busy.&#160; It was about 1:45pm when Jerry arrived at the door with his  boxes of bread.&#160; I said "thank you" to him &amp; he was gone.&#160; I called Tim  right away &amp; he said that he will be over as soon as he could to get some of  the bread for his family &amp; friends.&#160; I was grateful for that.&#160; We put some  of the bread in the Material Aid Room for our clients.&#160; They are always grateful  for that treat.&#160; Tim came about 45 minutes later &amp; took some of the bread, we still had a lot left for our clients.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Linda H. came to help us out today &amp; she was  feeling much better than last week.&#160; Her &amp; her daughter Lisa, our new  volunteer, will be going to Mexico to Guadeloupe next Wednesday for 9 days as a  Religious Retreat.&#160; Wow!!&#160; What a blessing that will be for them.&#160; I asked them  to pray for us at Focus on their Pilgrimage.&#160; Linda said "yes".&#160; What a blessing  for us!!&#160;&#160;&#160;We will miss&#160; them. <br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha told me that Cleveland, our street friend  for over 17 years,&#160;had been arrested on Scio St. the day before.&#160; One of our  clients told her that.&#160; I hope that he stays in jail to get new clothes &amp; to  get cleaned up.&#160; I guess he was lying in front of the Grocery Store &amp; when  the police came he spoke badly to then &amp; tried to hit one of them.&#160; Not a  good idea Cleveland.&#160; But ironically he came to our door this afternoon, looking  better I'd say.&#160; He wanted food so Paul, who had just arrived, gave it to him.&#160;  Some things never change&gt;&gt;&gt;&#160; I received a call from one of our pregnant  clients asking for Paul's phone number.&#160; She wanted to call him to ask if he  would help her to move a couple of boxes to her new residence.&#160; When he came in  late today I thought that he was helping her but I was wrong.&#160; He said that he  had took his phone off the ringer to sleep in today &amp; he slept until 11am.&#160;  Good Paul but could you do me a favor.&#160; I told him what I would like him to do  &amp; he said "okay".&#160; I then gave him the phone &amp; her number &amp; he  called her to make arrangements for him to help her.&#160; They made it for 6pm  tonight.&#160; Yeah, I'm so happy &amp; thankful that this worked out dear Lord.&#160; It  was about 7:15pm that Paul brought our client in to see us.&#160; It was great!!&#160;  Then after a short visit he brought her home.&#160; That was so nice of  Paul.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was about 3:30pm when Donna came with her son  &amp; his friend to help us out at the center.&#160;I greeted them &amp; then&#160;I sat  them all down, at the table in the Green Room,&#160;&amp; they folded the brochures,  that John had just printed &amp; left for us at the front door, on Saturday.&#160;  They will be coming back &amp; bringing maybe two more students with them.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sandy came earlier today &amp; she worked very hard  along with Martha.&#160; Martha went outside to pray in front of Planned Parenthood  but she ended up taking a woman home that had just come out of the mill.&#160; Praise  God!!&#160; Then when she came back to the center her friend arrived, with two very  old&#160;Crosses, for our clients.&#160; Martha brought them into the center &amp; I  brought them into the Material Aid Room.&#160; They were both beautiful!!&#160; Then  Martha stayed in the center to continue her work there.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray  that some people will come out to pray &amp; to counsel or witness, out on the  front lines in front of the Killing Mill, Planned Parenthood.&#160; I hope real soon  dear Lord.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Thursday, November 28, 2012 on the Front  Lines</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I arrived at Focus at 12:50pm &amp; the center was  busy.&#160; There was 3 women in the Material Aid Room with one child.&#160; Julie said  that one of the women was taking to much so I said that she had the authority to  make sure that doesn't happen.&#160; I went into the room &amp; said that you can  take 5 items per child.&#160; They were fine with that news.&#160; I went back to talk to  Julie again &amp; suggested that she goes into the room to be with the women  when they are in there, to talk to them &amp; to observe them too.&#160; She said  "okay".&#160; Sheila then came into the center to talk to me about the Mass, in  Holly, NY, on December 8th..&#160; She will meet Martha &amp; I at the Mass then  after Mass, Father Mark will bless Martha &amp; I, for the Consecration to the  Blessed Mother Mary.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; Then Sheila told me that she had met Julie, some  years ago.&#160; I said "it's a small world".&#160; Then they both left.&#160; Paul was there  with me &amp; I gave him my car keys to get out all the new donation bags out of  my car.&#160; Then Dr. Karen just came in with bags of winter clothes that she had  stored in her basement at her home.&#160; She was mad at herself that she forgot the  other winter bags that she left at home, so she said that she would bring them  to us on next Tuesday along with diapers.&#160; Thanks Karen.&#160; Suzanne, our client  advocate,&#160;emailed me earlier today to tell me that she couldn't come today  because she had work to do at her job &amp; her homework assignment too.&#160;I just  gave this to the Lord.&#160; Maryanne, who prays out on the front lines at different  time on Thursdays,&#160;called to me &amp; said that she wanted me to have a Rosary  that was 'special".&#160; I thanked her for her kindness to me &amp; the blessing  that she gave me too. Then Sandy arrived &amp; was in the Material Aid Room  helping out our clients.&#160; She stayed for awhile to help us out.&#160; I felt like I  could go outside now, to be on the front lines, even though Martha wasn't here  yet.&#160; When I went outside there was Tom waiting for me.&#160; He is with Sheila &amp;  Paul on the morning/afternoon shift.&#160; He told me that a baby was saved from  being aborted.&#160; I said that was great!!!&#160; I later spoke with Paul, who is out  there with Sheila &amp; Tom.&#160; He said that a car pulled out of the Planned  Parenthood parking lot &amp; told him that she was here for an abortion but  changed her mind because people were out here.&#160; He told her where the Focus  Pregnancy Help Center was located &amp; she thanked him &amp; then left.&#160; Praise  God for this wonderful news for both mother &amp; child :)&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was Maryanne &amp; I for awhile, out on the  front lines, then Adolf arrived to pray on the other side of the street, right  in front of Planned Parenthood, to witness to the public.&#160; Maryanne had to leave  so now it was just Adolf &amp; myself.&#160; We had the Holy Spirit with us &amp; the  prayers &amp; protection of the Angels &amp; the Saints too.&#160; I felt safe.&#160; I  spoke to every car that drove in the Killing Mill.&#160; No one reacted or really  cared to hear the Truth.&#160; Oh Lord what has happened to us as  'people'?????</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was about 2pm now &amp; Martha drove by me on  the street.&#160; She came to the sidewalk about 10 minutes later.&#160; She had things to  do in the center first.&#160; When I saw her I greeted her then I asked her what had  made her late today.&#160; She said that the bugs came back to her kitchen.&#160; I told  her that she needs to call her landlord &amp; we'll talk more about it later.&#160; I  was very happy to have her there, out on the sidewalk with me now, to pray &amp;  to counsel.&#160; She went on to counsel everyone who enter the parking lot.&#160; I stood  on the sidewalk witnessing to the people driving by with a graphic sign.&#160; I hope  that we're saving lives, for our offended Lord.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the women &amp; girls started to come out of  the Killing&#160;Mill, with their heads bent over.&#160; It's always a horrible sight to  see.&#160;&#160;There were two men who had dropped off their girlfriends &amp; then they  left&#160;&amp; came back a couple of hours later to pick up their  victims.&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha&#160;&amp; I went back into the center about 4:40pm.&#160;  We continued our work in there then ate supper of homemade turkey soup &amp;  salad.&#160; We talked about our experiences out on the front lines &amp; other Focus  issues.&#160;We went home, very tired but satified that we were able to help again, many people in the center, this week.&#160;&#160; </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font size="2" face="Arial"><br /></font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="2" face="arial" color="black"><div style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Here is a note from Sheila, who sidewalk  counsels in front of Planned Parenthood, on Thursdays from 10:30am to 1pm along  with her dedicated team members of usually <span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><font size="2">2</font></span> or<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> <font size="2">3</font></span> people.&#160; This was a prayer  answered &amp; thank God for your prayers to make this happen.

A group of  Charismatic Episcopal Church members were there also. It looked as though they  had held a service…..there were booklets entitled “Liturgy for the Preborn at  the Time of Death”. Several clergymen were there, including Rev. Canon Terry  Gensemer, from Alabama, and Bishop Gregory Ortiz from New Paltz NY. The group  left shortly after I arrived, and so did Pat and Bill.</span></span></span></div><div style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tom began circling the block praying the rosary,  which left Jennifer and myself on the sidewalk. While we were there alone, a car  exited the parking lot and pulled over when we asked them to. I asked the woman  passenger if she had been at Planned Parenthood for an appointment. She looked  upset. I asked her if she had just had an abortion. She said no, she couldn’t do  it. She was there for that purpose, but left. Jennifer asked her what made her  change her mind, and she said it was seeing the people praying on the sidewalk.  We were, of course, very happy. We told her about the Focus Pregnancy Help  Center, and that we would be there to help her. She didn’t stop in today, but I  gave her a packet, and wrote her name in my Golden Book of People I Pray For,  and asked her to pray for us. She said she would. <br /></span></span></span></div><div style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;">God Bless,<br /></span></span></span></div><div style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;">  Sheila</span></span></span></div><div style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">&#160;</div></font></font></div></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></div></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"><div><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font color="black"><font color="black">Fr.

You have to.&#160; It doesn't happen to often.&#160; Next week we'll  have the table set, in the Green Room, with&#160;homemade &amp; bought cookies, punch  &amp; milk, for our clients &amp; their children who come to Focus to get the  help that they need.&#160; It should be fun!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I came out of the office to hear Paul say to one  of&#160;the pregnant woman, that&#160;all we have are beans, in our Food Cupboard.&#160; Which  is true unfortunately.&#160;I tried to talk with her &amp; asked her if she was going  to breast feed her baby.&#160; She said "I don't think so".&#160; I told her that it was  the best for her baby &amp; then went into the room to get her the 4 brochures  on breast feeding &amp; gave it to her.&#160; She had shopped&#160;in the Material Aid  Room &amp;&#160;had some bags filled.&#160; I also gave her our Referral List, for Food  Services, &amp; our other Referral List, that has general information on it.&#160;She  was grateful.&#160; She had looked&#160;in the bags, of winter clothes,&#160;that Karen had  just dropped off along with&#160;a big box of diapers.&#160; &#160;She got some things in there  too then left.&#160; It was about an hour later that Jennifer came in to tell&#160;me more  about this young pregnant girl.&#160; She said that she was walking on the sidewalk  where Jennifer was sidewalk counseling &amp; come to find out that this girl had  had an abortion in her past.&#160; She said that she would never&#160;do that again &amp;  now has a son &amp; is pregnant again.&#160; She told Jennifer that her boyfriend, of  6 years, beats her when he's drunk.&#160; Oh Lord&#160;no!&#160; She &amp; her son &amp; baby  in her womb are in danger with this abusive guy.&#160; So&#160;Jennifer &amp; I spoke  &amp; I gave her the girls phone number that she&#160;left in the Material Aid Room's  Sign In Book &amp; also I wrote down the names&#160; phone numbers of The Bethany  House, Alternatives&#160;for Battered Women &amp; a post abortion counseling group  Rachel Project, for her to call her &amp; to give her this very important  information for her&#160;&amp; her children's 'freedom'.&#160; I'm sure that Jennifer will  get back to&#160;me, in regards to her phone call, with this young girl.&#160; We want to  help her &amp; I only hope &amp; pray that she wants the help that we have for  her.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was Ni, who is at Focus  on Mondays, from 4:15pm to 5:30pm.&#160; She stopped off to drop a couple of bags of  things that&#160;her customers gave her for us.&#160; How nice was that!!&#160; It was now  3:40pm &amp; Linda, our volunteer,&#160;came into the center to help us out &amp; she  does a great job too.&#160; She comes right over from her work day, on Tuesdays, to  spend a couple of hours with us&#160;putting away things.&#160;A lot gets done when  she's&#160;at&#160; Focus.&#160; I went to the car to get the gallon of paint that&#160;I got for  our bathroom.&#160; I put&#160;some of it on the wall &amp; Martha &amp; I don't like it.&#160;  Not 'yellow' enough.&#160; So now I have to go&#160;back to the store to get more yellow  put into the paint....booo!!&#160;&#160; Frank will be coming on Thursday at 10am to start  the painting in the bathroom so I have to go tomorrow to get the paint fixed  up.&#160; I hope&#160;that all&#160;will go well with the paint getting 'fixed up'.&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha made supper of chicken &amp; sweet potatoes  &amp; a salad with broccoli &amp; tomatoes then when we were done, around,  6:45pm, the doorbell rang.&#160; I went to the door &amp; it was Todd, who is on our  board.&#160; I opened the door &amp; greeted him &amp; said that the next board  meeting was next Tuesday, not tonight.&#160; He said that was all right &amp; stayed  &amp; talked with me for about 10 minutes. What a shame but he said that he'll  be back next week, for the meeting. Martha left &amp; I stayed, for a  short&#160;time, to finish up my work, then I left to go to the Post Ofice, to <font face="Arial">pick</font> up a check d<font face="Arial">o</font>nation, for Focus.&#160;&#160;

We had a very nice  young man come to the center to shop for his 1 year old son.&#160; I gave him some  bread for him to take home.&#160; I also asked if he wanted a Christmas Tree &amp; he  said "yes".&#160; I was happy &amp; then made arrangements for Paul to take him &amp;  the tree home, for he said that he lived right in this neighborhood.&#160; Later on  he said that he had called his mother &amp; she said that they already had a  tree &amp; for us to give it to someone that really needed it.&#160;&#160;Martha &amp;  I&#160;thanked him for his consideration.&#160; Tim came in &amp; gave Focus some clothes  from his home.&#160; He had asked me if Jerry the bread man had come &amp; I said  "no".&#160; I asked Tim if he wanted me to call him if he does &amp; he said "sure,  why not".&#160; I said "okay I will", but Jerry never came today &amp; he didn't call  either.&#160; We did have some bread in the freezer form last week that we put out  into the Material Aid Room, for our clients &amp; their families, which was  appreciated.&#160; Tim, while he was at the center, made our front doorbell work  better.&#160; Thanks Tim.&#160;After he had left Martha, Paul&#160; &amp; I went back to work,  after Martha &amp; I, had a quick lunch of an egg salad sandwich &amp; corn  chips.&#160; &#160;Then Martha &amp; I wrote down some information about the Focus Center,  for an article, for her Newsletter,&#160;that Donna, from St. John of Rochester  Church, had requested that we do for her.&#160;It had to be from 200 to 250 words, so  we worked on that project together, Martha did most of the work, I just&#160;added  something's to it.&#160;I was going to do the Christmas Card for our wonderful  volunteers when the doorbell rang.&#160; Martha got the door &amp; went into the  Pregnancy Testing Room with two young girls.&#160; The one girl was afraid that her  mother would find out that she needed a blood test, with her insurance, but I  told Martha that she has to tell her mother in order to see a doctor.&#160; This  young girl hasn't gotten her period in 2 months &amp; needs to see a&#160;Physician  to see why.&#160; &#160;Martha went back into the room to talk with her again &amp; to  give her our Doctor's List, that she could call to make an appointment with.&#160;  The two girls seemed to be better just before they left.&#160; While&#160;I was making out  the Christmas Cards for our 3 Elim girls the&#160;doorbell rang &amp; it was 3 young  girls that came into the center &amp; into the Green Room where I was at the  table.&#160; I asked them what could I do for them &amp; they answered that they  needed a pregnancy tests.&#160; I&#160;said to them, that Martha was doing&#160;a test,&#160;so they  would have to wait for a few minutes.&#160;&#160; When the Elim girls came today I was  surprised because I thought that last week was their last week before Christmas  but I was wrong, today is.&#160; I&#160;had Ruth type Martha's letter to Donna &amp; Leah,  I had her help one of our clients in the Material Aid Room &amp; then to put  some donations away.&#160; Zion was not with the other girls today&#160;for she had lots  of studying to do.&#160; I then offered them Martha's homemade raisin cookies &amp;  they liked them &amp; then thanked me.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;I continued to write out the cards for the girls  when Martha said to me "Mary, Cleveland, our homeless&#160;man,&#160;is lying right in  front of the front door", then she went to the Green Room to have the girls  come&#160;in for the pregnancy tests.&#160;&#160;Leah &amp; I went to the front door &amp; I  couldn't get out of the door because he was on the ground right in front of the  door.&#160; So I called out to him to move &amp; then I heard him say that he had  passed out earlier &amp; had fallen.&#160; I saw that his face was reddened by the  blood.&#160; He then said that he wanted to go to the General Hospital.&#160; I said I'll  call the police &amp; he&#160;didn't object so I did &amp; they came right away.&#160; I  finally made my way outside, maybe Cleveland&#160;had moved a bit so I could, &amp; I  went over to the police car while I was still on the 911 call &amp; asked him if  he was here for Cleveland &amp; he said that he was.&#160; Another police car pulled  into the parking lot then another, it was wild.&#160; Then Cleveland said "I don't  want to die".&#160; I responded&#160;to him that he wasn't going to die &amp; that he'll  be okay.&#160; The one police officer said to me that he was going to live longer  than he will.&#160; I smiled at him for his sense of humor.&#160; I then told Cleveland  that God loved him &amp; Martha&#160;&amp; I did too.&#160; Then we heard the Ambulance  siren but it was the Fire Truck instead.&#160; The same officer said that they had  nothing to do so they came out tonight.&#160; He&#160;has a wit.&#160;Then the ambulance&#160;came  to the scene.&#160; Mack, for next door came outside,&#160;&amp; I told him what was  happening to Cleveland.&#160; He looked relieved that he was being taken care of.&#160;  When the ambulance people came&#160;one guy was a little nasty to me.&#160; Once they had  put Cleveland on the stretcher I had asked him if he&#160;could have a blanket &amp;  he said for me to shut the door &amp; let us do our job.&#160; I said back to him  "no, he's my friend &amp; I'm staying here".&#160; Cleveland said that he was sick  all over.&#160; I was so happy to see that he was cooperating with the ambulance  attendants &amp; was going to the hospital to get better.&#160; The same police  officer&#160;said to me that he'll probably be out tomorrow.&#160; I hope not for he needs  a bath &amp; his hair washed &amp; for him to get better.&#160; Lord have Mercy on  our dear rough Cleveland.&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was now out of the Pregnancy Testing Room  &amp; the 3 girls were gone.&#160; She had done&#160;four pregnancy tests &amp; counseling  in an hour and&#160;fifteen minutes.&#160; These three girls were in need of God's help, like we  all do.&#160;&#160;Martha spoke to the<font face="Arial">m,</font> as a mother, &amp; she gave them&#160;lots of  information for then to think&#160;about.&#160; They were all negative<font face="Arial">.&#160;</font></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Again they didn't want the<font face="Arial">ir</font> mother's to find out that they were here at the Pregnancy Center.&#160;

It was Jim, from the condo across the street from Planned P<font face="Arial">a</font>renthood, that's given me a hard time over the years when I'm protesting that evil place.&#160; He hasn't in a while.&#160; We talked about w<font face="Arial">hat</font> was happening to Cleveland &amp; then he left.&#160; He can be nice at times.&#160; I hope that he will stay this way from now on!&#160; </span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Thursday, December 7, 2012 on the Front  Lines</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Pat, the grandmother &amp;

got him to the hospital.&#160; She had to fight with the main Pediatrician for  her to have him stay in the hospital for tests &amp; observation.&#160; Pat was worn  out with the bad attitude of the doctors at Strong Memorial Hospital.&#160;

said "thank you &amp; good bye" to her &amp; that  I'll see&#160;her on Tuesday.&#160; Then I spoke with Sheila for about 2 minutes.&#160; Paul  then approached me &amp; said that he was going to get something to eat so I  asked him for a hamburger, for myself. &amp; for Martha a chicken sandwich,  which he said that he would get for us.&#160; I went into the center to say "hi" to  Frank that was just finishing up painting the bathroom.&#160;He left.&#160; Then Karen  came into the center to volunteer from 1pm to 3pm.&#160;I got to speak with her for a  few minutes&#160;before going out to the front lines.&#160; When I was leaving Martha had  just arrived.&#160; I got to the sidewalk &amp; there was Tom &amp; Jennifer standing  there.&#160; I got to speak with them for a few minutes then Maryann came over  from&#160;across the street &amp; gave me her donation for&#160;Focus &amp; told me that  she will see me again in April of 2013.&#160; We will certainly miss her praying on  the front lines.&#160; Tom had to go but Jennifer was going to stay with Martha &amp;  I until 2pm.&#160; Martha had now come out of the sidewalk to pray &amp; to counsel.&#160;  The cars were going into the abortion mill &amp; coming out of it too.&#160; A car  with a young girl pulled on into the parking lot to pick up another young girl,  who had just had her precious baby&#160;be murdered in there, by an abortion.&#160; Why  don't they know&#160;what they're doing dear Lord against you &amp; your child that  you just created.&#160; Lord have&#160;Mercy on them all.&#160; &#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul drove by with our lunches so I said to Martha  "you first, me second".&#160;

When I arrived  into the center &amp; started to eat, Martha came in.&#160; She said that Jennifer  said that she wanted her to eat her warm lunch now &amp; that she'd be there  witnessing".&#160; So Martha &amp; I ate quickly &amp; was back outside by 2pm to  relieve Jennifer.&#160; How nice of you Jennifer.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I was standing by the tree by the entrance when a  car pulled out of the driveway &amp; the very pale girl put up fingers, from  each hand,&#160;at me.&#160; I said to her to repent for the sin of murder/ murder, I said  the word twice.&#160; Abortion is not a game it's murdering a child, so that you can  live, as you want to.&#160; How evil is that!!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Two young guys were walking down the sidewalk &amp;

How does one  deal with this?&#160; I just have to give them to the Lord &amp; then let go!!!!&#160;  They weren't in there for very long but 'why' did they want to go into a place  that was killing little children, is my question?????</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Martha &amp;

 The woman answered "to give them support".&#160; "What", I said, you have to be  kidding.&#160; Then the woman stated to talk about God &amp; quote the Bible.&#160; I  called her a hypocrite &amp; she got mad at me &amp; started to approach me.&#160; I  spoke in Tongues &amp; then so did she.&#160; I said to her that you responded when I  called you a hypocrite so you are.&#160; Martha was pouring Holy Water onto the  ground, where she was standing, but she didn't even notice.&#160; I said to her "to  go", just go" &amp; she did, right into Planned Parenthood.&#160; How sad &amp; evil  was this!!!&#160; What is wrong with people.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Mike V. came today &amp;

He came over to Martha &amp; I &amp;  greeted us before he left.&#160; It was good to see him again.&#160;&#160; I received a phone  call for one of our clients &amp; she asked if we were at the center&#160;right now,  to drop off bags of donations for us.&#160; I said that we were &amp; she said that's  great.&#160; I thanked her &amp; we hung up.&#160; She did bring many bags of things &amp;  some big toys too.&#160; How nice was that!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was 2:50pm &amp; I went back into the center to  see if Suzanne was in there, I was starting to worry.&#160; She wasn't there yet.&#160; I  talked with Karen for a few minutes then Suzanne arrived.&#160; She said that she's  so busy at work &amp; school but she still wants to come to Focus.&#160; I said for  her to come at the time that works out for her, so that she can still come, to  help us.&#160; She agreed.&#160; I said "good bye" to both ladies &amp; went back outside  to rejoin Martha.&#160; She was talking with a young girl when I approached them.&#160;  The girl said that she was 51/2 weeks pregnant so I lead her to Focus for some  assistance.&#160; I got to the door &amp; lead her in &amp; Suzanne was walking down  the hallway &amp; greeted her.&#160; She came out of the center about 20 minutes  later.&#160; Martha &amp; I spoke with her for about 1 minute &amp; then she walked  into Planned Parenthood to wait for her mother to pick her up.&#160; Martha suggested  that she waits for her mom, at the Focus Center.&#160; She came back outside about 5  minutes later &amp; said that her mom wanted her to walk to Hudson Ave. for her  pick ride.&#160; Oh gee, thanks mom.&#160; Poor young girl.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We went into the center around 4:45pm &amp; did some more work in the<font face="Arial">re.&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> I called the hospitals but Cleveland wasn't at any of them. Poor Cleveland.&#160; Valerie came to help us out &amp; Paul brought her home about an hour later.&#160; Martha &amp; I ate supper then she left.&#160; I stayed for awhile then I&#160;left to go home .&#160;

it  was a client that told me that no one was there at the center.&#160; I told her to  keep ringing the doorbell because maybe Julie is in the back room &amp; she  can't hear it.&#160; She said that&#160;she had &amp; no has answered.&#160; I told her that I  will call the office &amp; then call her back.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; hung up.&#160;  I called the center's office phone hoping that Julie would answer but it went to  voice mail &amp; I hung up &amp; called the client back &amp; told her that I  was sorry that Julie wasn't there but if she could please come back at 1pm when  we'll be open.&#160; She said that she would try &amp; then hung up.&#160; I then called  Julie &amp; got her voice mail &amp; left a message for her to call me back.&#160;  Then my cell phone rang again about 30 minutes later saying that no one was at  Focus &amp; he was there to pick up the baby stroller, that we had for him.&#160; I  told him what had happened &amp; he said that he will come back on Thursday  afternoon.&#160; I said "fine, thank you".&#160; It was about 15 minutes later that Julie  called me back &amp; told me that she had called me yesterday &amp; left a  message on my cell phone to tell me that she will not be working at Focus  anymore, for she had hurt her back at her paying nursing job &amp; couldn't come  to Focus to help us out unless she gets better.&#160; She was worried about her job  &amp; finances &amp; that she will miss Focus.&#160; I told her not to worry for the  Lord has a&#160; plan for her &amp; all will be right just wait &amp; see.&#160; I said if  she could come back to Focus that would be great &amp; she agreed.&#160; We said  "good bye &amp; Merry Christmas" &amp; hung up the phone.&#160; I was in shock for  her &amp; for us but I knew that God had a great plan for both of us &amp; to  trust Him.&#160; I got ready to go to Mass at noon.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">After Mass I told Martha &amp; she was disappointed  but understood that Julie had no choice.&#160; I understood too &amp; then after I  got to the center I made some phone calls to tell the people that I had already  told, of our morning hours, that they have changed for their donation  deliveries.&#160; We made other plans.&#160; It worked out well &amp; then I made a sign  for the front door that gave our Focus Center's days &amp; hours.&#160; I hope that  helps, for me to receive fewer calls, in the morning.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was busy setting up our Christmas table, of  fruit punch &amp;

&#160;Martha saw 10 clients today.&#160; She did one pregnancy test &amp; it was  positive. &#160;She gave her the Truth packet &amp; other informational materials for  her benefit.&#160; She, thank God, was not abortion minded.&#160;

Jerry came with 2 big boxes of bread for our  clients.&#160; I was waiting for Lori who was going to bring us about 4 boxes of  clothes &amp; things, from her home, to us at Focus.&#160; She came around 1:45pm  &amp; was impressed with our humble pregnancy center.&#160; There were two men  getting things for their children, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Martha was back  from the front lines, &amp; she&#160;was helping them with things.&#160; I was showing  Lori, around after she had brought in the donation boxes, from her van.&#160; She  though that the center was great &amp; was going to tell her friends at the  Bible Study, at St. Joseph's Church, where I recently spoke.&#160; It was a marvelous  time with Lori today.&#160; Then Paul arrived &amp; got to work cleaning the toy  donations.&#160; He enjoys this so much.&#160; I'm glad.&#160; Sandy came in about 4pm &amp;  stayed&#160;for awhile &amp; then Paul brought her home.&#160; We had a couple of more  clients in the Material Aid Room &amp; Martha did one pregnancy test.&#160;  Her&#160;boyfriend &amp; baby came in to the room with her.&#160; She was negative &amp;  Martha spoke to her with love &amp; truth.&#160; Her boyfriend seemed to agree with  Martha, which was a surprise.&#160;&#160; Martha gave her a Truth packet &amp; him a Maafa  21: Black Genocide DVD to take home.&#160; I hope &amp; pray the they both watch it.&#160;  &#160;Seems like a nice couple who love their baby now I hope that they love  themselves &amp; remain chaste until they get married. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha wasn't feeling well so she went home  early tonight.&#160;

I told him to ask Sheila to open up  the door for him to get the toys in the Great Room.&#160; Also, Tony called me to  tell me that he was going to drop off the sofa to the center this afternoon.&#160;I  also received a call from a client&#160;from yesterday that I told him that we were  going to have 'free'&#160;toys in the center around 1pm&#160;on Thursday.&#160; He called to  see if the Pastor had dropped off the toys.&#160; I told him that I didn't know  because I wasn't at the center until 1pm &amp; for him to stop by this  afternoon.&#160; He said that he would.&#160; I then got ready to go to Mass at the Sacred  Heart Cathedral.&#160; After Mass Charles stopped me to tell me that he had two bags  filled with stuffed animals for the center.&#160; I asked him if he could please drop  them off at the center for I didn't have any room in my car for it was filled up  with bags &amp; boxes from Ana who had dropped them off in my garage.&#160; He said  "okay".&#160; When I got to Focus there were people getting out of their cars &amp;  coming to the door.&#160; I was overwhelmed.&#160; I didn't even get into the center &amp;  there were 8 people right there in the doorway.&#160; I didn't even know, for sure  that the Pastor had dropped off the toys, thank God that he did.&#160; I walked into  the Green Room to see a not that Paul had left saying that he wasn't able to get  to Focus this afternoon for he had to help one of our clients.&#160; I was in a dizzy  but I trusted the Lord that He would see me through &amp; He did.&#160; I led the  army into the Great Room &amp; saw all the plastic baskets filled with clothes  &amp; toys.&#160; I told everyone that all that were in the baskets could be taken  &amp; nothing else.&#160; I also asked them to take only 5 things per child.&#160; Then  one of the ladies accidentally broke a vase that we have flowers in for our  Masses.&#160; She said that she was sorry &amp; I felt badly but I knew that it was  an accident.&#160; The one of the ladies asked if she could have a pregnancy test  along with her two young children.&#160; Thank God that Karen, our wonderful  volunteer,&#160;came into the center &amp; I asked if she would give a pregnancy  test.&#160; She said "of course I will".&#160; She lead&#160;the client&#160;into to the room, along  with her son &amp; daughter, for the test.&#160; It was negative.&#160;She was given some  literature to take home. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I was also worried about the team out on the front  lines but I knew that God will provide &amp; He did.&#160; When I went to the door to  leave for the sidewalk Martha was coming into the center, it was about 1:30pm.&#160;  I said "hi" &amp; left quickly to go out to the front lines.&#160; There was  Jennifer, all by herself, but she said that she doesn't mind.&#160; Martha joined us  about&#160;10 minutes later.&#160; She was feeling better than yesterday, thank God.&#160;  Jennifer then went across&#160;the street to the sidewalk, to witness with two  signs,&#160;where the nasty young man who threatened Rob, this summer, gave her the  finger.&#160; How sad it that!&#160; I hope he gets help for what is bothering him.&#160; She  left at 2pm today.&#160; I went back into the center to get something &amp; lead two  clients in with me.&#160; I told Karen that Paul wasn't going to be her this  afternoon &amp; that Suzanne was going to be late.&#160; She understood &amp; worked  very hard with all the clients &amp; donations. We saw 18 clients this  afternoon.&#160; Wow!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When I got back to the front lines there was Dan  talking to Martha &amp; about 10 minutes later Mike&#160;arrived.&#160; We spoke for a few  minutes &amp; then&#160;I started to witness again with the graphic sign &amp;&#160; using  the mega phone. Martha was praying along with Dan &amp;&#160;Mike.&#160; The cars were  coming in &amp; out of the Killing Mill.&#160; &#160;&#160;A  woman, when pulling out of the driveway,with her daughter, gave me her finger.&#160;  I told her that she had her grandchild be killed in there &amp; for them both to  repent.&#160; It was so horrible.&#160; How could this have happened?????</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Dan &amp; Mike had gone &amp; know it was Martha  &amp; I out there.&#160; I had to go back into the center &amp; when I got to the  door there were two girls wanting to get into the center.&#160; Karen was leaving  now.&#160; I had to go in &amp; to wait until all the people had left, before I went  back outside, to be with Martha again.&#160; Suzanne had called me to tell me that  she was coming.&#160; It was now 3pm.&#160; After everyone had left I went back outside  again.&#160; It was about a few minutes later that a man had come around the bushes  to talk to us.&#160; I told him what was going on in Planned Parenthood.&#160; He said  that he had brought his daughters in for a physical.&#160; I gave him two Truth  packets &amp; a two DVD's for his daughters.&#160; He was grateful &amp; then left.&#160;  It was later on that two young girls came to us &amp; asked for a packet &amp; a  Rosary.&#160; We talked with them for about a minute &amp; come to find out that  these were the two daughter of the mane&#160;that we just spoke with.&#160; One girl was  pregnant &amp; the other girl wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I told them where to go  &amp; lead them to Focus, where Suzanne greeted them, at the door.&#160; The father  came a few minutes later with the one&#160;daughter's little daughter.&#160; Suzanne lead  them all into the pregnancy testing room.&#160; There she did the teat, which was  negative &amp; she counseled&#160;the young lady &amp; gave her literature.&#160; Then she  lead then to the Material Aid Room for clothes &amp; things.&#160; Martha&#160;&amp; I met  up with them back on the sidewalk.&#160; They told us that their father had to go  &amp; were waiting for a ride from their mother.&#160; The little girl, came over to  the aborted&#160;baby sign, &amp; said "baby".&#160; &#160;My heart sank, for this so true.&#160; I  was so touched by the tenderness of this small child when she went from one sign  to the other &amp; said "baby".&#160; Oh Lord!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This afternoon when Martha &amp; I were out on the front lines, in front  of&#160;Planned&#160;Parenthood, a car had pulled out of the driveway with a young girl  &#160;driven by an older woman, rolled down the window. &#160; I asked her if she had an  abortion &amp; she&#160;said&#160;"no, I was but you all changed my mind". &#160;I offered her  a truth packet &amp; DVD &amp; she got out of the car to receive them. &#160;I asked  her what changed her mind &amp; she said it was the graphic pictures. &#160;We then  all hugged. &#160;I said that now you'll have a Merry Christmas &amp; a great New  Year. She turned around &amp; smiled at Martha &amp; I &amp; then got back into  the car &amp; left.&#160;She was very happy.&#160; This&#160;brightened&#160;our&#160;spirits, after many  hours of praying &amp; witnessing.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We had a couple of nasty, evil acting people harass  us, but we're not bothered by them, we feel sorry for them &amp;

our client was eating a piece of it.&#160; It was very good.&#160; She had  left, to get the bus,&#160;before I got back into the center again, for I had to go  outside to get the signs &amp; the literature box to bring in.&#160;&#160;I did say the  workers as they were leaving Planned Parenthood that a baby was&#160;saved from being  killed but did they care???&#160; It didn't seem so.&#160; How sad it that.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When I finally did get back in the center &amp;  took off my coat there was Scott &amp; Martha &amp; a very nice pizza.&#160; It was  delicious!&#160; Then around 6:15pm along came Natalie &amp; Faye came to help us  out.&#160; They got to work ASAP &amp; they did so much too.&#160; At the end of the hour  &amp; a half, the Great Room was looking great again.&#160; They had taken all the  plastic bins &amp; had emptied them into the Material Room.&#160; Great work ladies.&#160;  After they left I stayed for another 30 more minutes &amp; then I left.&#160; Martha  had left around 7pm to&#160;go to Holy Hour at St. Jude's Church.&#160; I also found out, on the  computer, that Focus received today from ROC the Day $246.00, from donations.  &#160;It was a blessed a marvelous day!!!&#160;

he said that he did, so I said "come on in &amp; get  what you need for your child".&#160; He was so happy.&#160; Then the doorbell kept on  ringing.&#160; We had three new volunteers come in today from St. John of Rochester  Church group &amp; I showed them around &amp; got them started to put our  donations away.&#160; They worked so very hard for an hour that it blew my mind.&#160; It  was great!!&#160; I asked if they wanted anything to eat &amp;

I called the  volunteer from Mondays &amp; she didn't know what happened to them.&#160; So I called  &amp; ordered a box to be sent to us as soon as possible.&#160; Then I called Dee  from Embracing Options &amp; asked her if she had any for Focus &amp; she said  that she had a box that she would give us.&#160; I said "thank you so very much Dee"  &amp; said that I would ask Paul to go over to pick them up for us.&#160;

to clean the toys  that will go into the Material Aid Room.&#160; I worked in the office printing more  brochures &amp; making up Truth packets.&#160; Martha did one pregnancy test.&#160; I was  in the office when Paul came to tell me that a woman was here for a pregnancy  test but Martha was in the Rose Room helping another client out with one.&#160; I  said "thanks Paul" &amp; went to the hall to greet our new client.&#160; She was with  her young daughter who was around 10 years old.&#160; I brought them into the Green  Room to have a seat to wait for Martha to come our of the Counseling Room.&#160; I  worked at the table putting diapers into bags then I asked the woman if she was  in a hurry &amp; she said that she was.&#160; So I knocked on the door &amp; went  into the room to get the Client Intake Sheet &amp; then left.&#160; I asked her to  fill the page out then she could take the test that she would administer.&#160; She  filled the form out then I gave her a cup &amp; lead her to our bathroom.&#160; When  she came out I then brought her &amp; her daughter into the Rose Room for now it  was available to us.&#160; The teat was negative &amp; I talked with her briefly  &amp; gave her a Truth packet &amp; lots of brochures, to help her in the  decision of abstinence.&#160; They were now on there way out the door &amp; thanked  me.&#160;&#160; Martha's client was negative too but more complicated than my client was  but Martha had time to talk with her &amp; to give her some information to take  home with her.&#160; On the way our she thanked us. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We didn't have any volunteers today except Paul who  is a regular.&#160; But Dan stopped by to visit with Martha &amp; I for awhile &amp;  he had supper with us too.&#160; He even had some of Martha's birthday cake which he  enjoyed :)</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /></span></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Thursday, December 20, 2012 on the Front  Lines</font></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a horrible day of Evil!!&#160; It's so hard to  write about Thursdays but I must, for you &amp; for me.&#160; Martha &amp; I got to  the center &amp; then went out to the front lines.&#160; Paul was in the center,  taking care of our clients that will come this afternoon &amp; putting away  donations&#160;&amp; Suzanne was out preparing for a test on Friday &amp; wasn't  going to come this afternoon&#160;&amp; Karen said that she would be late today for  she was going to the Christmas Party at Embracing Options&#160; Pregnancy Center  where she does the ultrasounds on Wednesdays &amp; is preparing to work there as  a Physician.&#160; So I was ready.&#160; I wished Sheila, who is out on the front lines  from 10:30am to 1pm, a Merry Christmas &amp; gave her, her present &amp; card.&#160;  I was happy to be able to greet her.&#160; Tom was out there too so I wished him a  Merry Christmas too&#160;before he left.&#160; They told me that the abortionist, Rachel  Phelps, had left with some women in the car probably to go to lunch.&#160; They said  that it wasn't to busy, this morning.&#160; But that means that precious babies are  being killed, which is horrible.&#160; I was hoping that she wouldn't come back to  kill more children this afternoon.&#160; I was wrong.....she came back around 1:30pm  with the woman in her car.&#160; I begged them to leave this place of murder &amp;  that you're following a mass murder, the abortionist!!&#160; They all went into the  back door, of Planned Parenthood, to kill some more children.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was now just Martha &amp; I out on the front  lines &amp; Adolph &amp; Dan&#160;came about 30 minutes later to witness &amp; to  pray, across the street.&#160; One car after another went in &amp; out of the  abortion mill.&#160; I greeted the one Death Escort, who was walking down the  sidewalk heading to the abortion mill, that she was worried about Hell, for&#160;she  had called the police on me awhile ago &amp; I said to her&#160;"you are heading  right to&#160;the place of evil &amp; pain &amp; torment forever".&#160; She just smiled  at me as she entered the gates of Hell&#160;of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Some people just  won't listen to the Truth.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was about 4:15pm now &amp; Adolph was gone,  for&#160;he leaves at 4pm.&#160; He drives about 45 minutes to go home, from the front  lines.&#160; He's so dedicated.&#160; Dan had left  earlier.&#160; Martha &amp; I were standing on the sidewalk when a car drove down the  street when it stopped, &amp; a man got out of his car to walk over to us.&#160;He  greeted me saying "please keep on doing what you're doing here".&#160; I said "thank  you, we will".&#160; Then he said something so horrible.&#160; He said to me "my  girlfriend is in there killing my child".&#160; Martha was now next to me so she  heard his statement.&#160; We both almost passed out but we have to stay strong.&#160; He  said that he has tried for two months now in trying to talk&#160;her out of killing  this baby but she refused.&#160; He then said that her mother drove her in.&#160; Martha  &amp; I said "yes we know for we just saw them pull into the parking lot".&#160; I  asked him to go in there, to try one more time, to talk her out of the abortion  but he said that he said all that he could say to her already &amp; then he  looked right in my eyes &amp; said "men have no rights".&#160; I said back to him "no  they don't. I'm sorry".&#160; I gave him some literature &amp; Martha took him aside  to speak Truth to him about his future behavior.&#160; He left very sad &amp; so were  we.&#160; How dreadful is this?????&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was about 4:30pm when a car, with a young girl<font face="Arial">,</font> a child in the back seat, with an older woman driver, drove out of the  Killing Mill.&#160; I noticed that the car pulled into our parking lot which is two  doors down the street.&#160;&#160;I told Martha that I was going to go to see why there  were going into Focus.&#160; When I got to the door the young girl was being lead  into the center by Paul.&#160; I asked her why she was at Planned Parenthood &amp;  she said "for birth control".&#160; I said "no it acts as an abortificant drug that  could&#160;kill her&#160;unborn baby &amp; can hut you".&#160; I said that I had a packet of  information for her.&#160; She replied back to me that she already has on".&#160; I then  said to her "then please look at it &amp; read it".&#160; She was at Focus for  diapers &amp; some things for her child, who was in the car.&#160; I left the center  &amp; went to the car to try to talk to&#160;her mother who was like a 'brick'.&#160; It  was very difficult for she didn't want to hear anything about birth control  though she said that she didn't believe in abortion.&#160; I told her that they are  the same for they both kill an unborn baby.&#160; She didn't agree.&#160; I said "it  doesn't matter if you don't believe in what I just told you but it's TRUE, so  you should for the sake of your daughter"!&#160; I left to go to the front lines to  get a Truth packet &amp; walked back to the car where this woman was waiting for  her daughter to come out of the center.&#160; I said to her "this is my Christmas  present&#160;to you".&#160; She looked it &amp; said "no thanks".&#160; I said "you refuse my  present" &amp; she said "yes".&#160; As&#160;I was walking away from her I asked her to  not hurt her daughter.&#160; I just didn't want her daughter to keep on taking the  birth control that can kill her baby &amp; hurt her too.&#160; This mother was no  help.&#160; When I got back to the front lines I asked Martha if she would go try to  talk to this woman.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; then left.&#160; She came back about 10  minutes later so I thought that they were having a great talk but it turned out  not to be the case.&#160; The girl was getting into the car when&#160;Martha arrived so  she said to the woman "the Lord loves you" &amp; then they left. Martha went  into the center to go make coffee, for she was very cold.&#160; She tried at least to  talk to this hard minded woman/mother/grandmother.....</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was about 5pm when we went back into the center  for the evening.&#160; Valerie, our client,&#160;came out&#160; to help us bring, into the  center, all that we had out on the sidewalk.&#160; I&#160;saw the mother of the girl, that  was in there killing the man's baby, that objected, &amp; I just looked at her  &amp; I&#160;can't remember what I said to her.&#160; My heart just sank.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I went into the center to now visit with Paul,  Valerie &amp; Martha.&#160; A couple of clients came into the center to get what they  needed for their children for Christmas.&#160; This was comforting to me.&#160;&#160;Martha  &amp; I&#160;had supper &amp;&#160;then I did some work in the office &amp; Martha left to  go to Holy Hour.&#160;&#160;Then I locked&#160;up the Focus Center&#160;&amp; left to go home.&#160;  &#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;</div></div></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;DECEMBER 25, 2012 <font face="Arial">...

Martha, Paul &amp; I were pleasantly busy with our work to  better our pregnancy center.&#160; Martha &amp; I had lunch together.&#160; We had&#160;a  cheese sandwich &amp; some pickles, on the side.&#160; Paul always eats before he  come to Focus.&#160; There were plenty of deserts to eat all day long.&#160; We  had&#160;six&#160;clients come into the center.&#160; Some were guys getting diapers for their  children, which is great to see.&#160; We usually thank them for taking good care of  their children &amp; they smile bad at us, which makes us feel good.&#160; The  fathers need&#160;our support too.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Tim came in to see if Jerry had come with the  bread.&#160;

said that she couldn't get her car out of the parking lot where she  lives.&#160; So I asked her if she wanted me to come get her &amp; she said "yes".&#160; I  did some phone work from my apartment &amp; then got ready to go to pick  up&#160;Martha.&#160; The party that I was invited to was canceled, for later this  evening.&#160; I figured that would happen because of the weather.&#160; Sheila called me  to tell me that she &amp; Bishop Ortiz &amp; his parishioners, from the Lutheran  Church, had come to pray in front of Planned Parenthood this morning.&#160; I asked  her if they were doing abortions today &amp; she said "yes Mary, they kill  children every day".&#160; It wasn't the answer I wanted to hear but it was so true  unfortunately.&#160; She said that they had just cleared off the parking lot,  where&#160;our center is,&#160;so that the cars could now get through.&#160; That was good to  hear.&#160; I told her that I would be there at 1pm &amp; she said that she was going  to leave a half an hour&#160;earlier today.&#160; I wished her a Happy New Year &amp; she  did the same for me.&#160; I then left to go to pick up Martha.&#160; The roads weren't  that bad, which I was happy about.&#160; We arrived at the center around 1pm.&#160;&#160;We got  there at our usual time to witness for life.&#160; Paul was already out on the front  lines praying &amp; when he saw us he came into the center, while Martha &amp; I  were outside, on the front lines.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I were now out on the snowy sidewalk  that hadn't been plowed so it was a mess.&#160; I had bought a shovel before I went t  pick up Martha today so Paul came out of the center to do some snow plowing for  us.&#160; How nice he is.&#160; After he got done Martha &amp; I started to witness the  'life' message to those coming in &amp; going out of this Killing Mill.&#160; Then we  saw the abortionist, Rachael Phelps, leave.&#160; We were so happy thinking that no  precious baby would be killed here this afternoon.&#160; I was&#160;so wrong, for she came  back into the parking lot about an hour &amp; a half later, &amp; she did murder  more children today.&#160; It is so horrible to be at a place where they are  murdering little babies.&#160; As they leave the mother &amp; father flip up their  middle finger at me as I give them a soul saving message.&#160; Evil is so  blind.&#160;The biggest why is 'why is Planned  Parenthood killing little babies'???&#160; That's the 'why' I can't, nor do I want,  to understand.</span></div><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Adolf, who was across the street, Martha &amp; I were the only people out  there today praying &amp; counseling &amp; witnessing, to the public with our  graphic signs, when a police car stopped where we were standing.&#160; I thought that  it was Officer Chris, who is our pro life advocate, but it was Officer Mike.&#160;  Martha &amp; I greeted him &amp; spoke with him for about 5 minutes &amp; then  he left.&#160; He is so nice &amp; is a prayerful man.&#160; He was our saving grace for  this place Planned Parenthood is sooo Evil.&#160; It was about 15 minutes later that  Officer Mike came back with 4 Hot Chocolates for us.&#160; How nice is that!!&#160; We  thanked him for his kindness &amp; told him that we will say an extra prayer for  him &amp; he said "thank you" &amp; gave us a big smile &amp; then left.&#160; God is  Great!!&#160; We called Adolf over for his Hot Chocolate &amp; he came over to enjoy  the beverage.&#160; I then went into the center to give one to Paul &amp; he was  happy.&#160; Suzanne wasn't there yet so I went back outside.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We continued to call out to the people going into the abortion mill to tell  them that we can help them.&#160; I pleaded with them not to have their baby killed  but they did never the less.&#160; How evil!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There was one young girl that parked close to where I was standing, while  Martha was in the center.&#160; I told her that I had a packet of information for her  &amp; it was free.&#160; She came over to where I was standing &amp; said "I'm not  here today to have an abortion".&#160; I said "I hope any day will not have an  abortion".&#160; She smiles at me &amp; said "no I wouldn't do that".&#160; I handed her  the Truth Packet &amp; she gave me a hand shake.&#160; I asked her name &amp; she  gave it to me &amp; I told her my name &amp; she left.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that  she will stop coming here.&#160; Education is Power!!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Adolf helped me to bring in the things from the sidewalk &amp; he left.&#160;  Suzanne was now in the center so I greeted her &amp; she thanked me for the  Christmas present that&#160;I gave her.&#160; She called some of the clients &amp;  assisted one young lady with a car seat application from the county.&#160; Good  job!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I went to my car &amp; got a plastic bag from my car that had my thermos  bottle, filled with tea, my vitamin case,&#160;a bag of&#160;tortilla chips, my  eyeglasses&#160;&amp; maybe some other things that I can't remember which we in the  bad that I didn't want to get lost.&#160; I brought the bag inside the center &amp;  took out my glasses &amp; the chips &amp; then left the bag on the table in the  Green Room.&#160; Oh darn, for later that evening I realized that I hadn't had any  tea today so I went to look for the bag &amp; I couldn't find it anywhere. Later  on I found the thermos, on the floor, in my car.&#160; It must have fallen out of the  bag.&#160; I had prayed to St. Anthony, the Saint of lost items,&#160;for me to find the  it.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul &amp; Suzanne were now gone home so it was Martha &amp; I at the  center.&#160; We were finished eating when the doorbell rang.&#160; It was Donna!&#160; I  haven't seen her since November for she's living in Virginia, with her husband  &amp; kids in an apartment, studying law.&#160; She &amp; her husband also own a home  in Rochester but I don't get to see her until she comes home on Holidays or  school breaks.&#160; She looked great!&#160; She brought in&#160;four bags, filled with clothes  &amp; toys, from little Hannah, who is almost 4 years old.&#160; She sat down &amp;  we visited for about 40 minutes.&#160; Martha joined us but then she got up from the  table &amp; said that she was going to call her ex husband to come take her home  so that she can go to Holy Hour tonight.&#160; Donna had to go so we said "good bye  &amp; I love" &amp; gave a big hug.&#160; Frank, came about 15 minutes later to pick  up Martha.&#160; We said "good bye &amp; happy New Year" &amp; hugged.&#160; I stayed  until all was done.&#160; </span></span></div></font></font></div></div></span></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span
