I looked at Martha &amp; asked if she would assist the client with one. &#160;She said "yes". &#160;The client then asked for coffee &amp; I smiles &amp; said "we are a pregnancy center dear". &#160;Martha made strong coffee &amp; the client, Frank &amp; Martha had some. &#160;I noticed that the young man had taken a brochure for the table on Post Abortion for Males &amp; I asked him if he had lost a child through abortion. He said "no". &#160;i was glad to have heard his answer. &#160;The pregnancy test was Positive &amp; I gave them lots of literature &amp;&#160;</span><span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc" id=":26w.1" role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true" data-g-spell-status="3" tabindex="-1">DVD's</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&#160;to take with them. &#160;I suggested marrying the mother of his child. &#160;We'll see. &#160;I walked outside to give her Breast Feeding literature &amp; she was grateful. &#160;Martha later told me that he asked if we take donations &amp; she said "yes" &amp; he said that he will bring some of his children's things to us. &#160;So maybe they won't get married &#160;:((</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Martha said that our Landlady told her on the phone that the neighbors call the City every other day to complain about Focus &amp; they are working (something) to get us out of here. &#160;The man next door even goes into Planned Parenthood &amp; complains about us.

Frank went &amp; got the food from our new food storage. &#160;He brought back a lot of fresh food &amp; bread for our client s who are appreciative. &#160;It was so hectic in the center. &#160;Jackie came &amp; we worked on the Focusphc.com website to which she will be the Administer. &#160;It took time. Then Sarah came in with her 19 month daughter Helen &amp; worked in the main room. &#160;Then Barbara came to help us out as some girls were making &amp; eating a peanut butter sandwich, at the table. &#160;Fran was kept busy with cutting up boxes &amp; putting then in our overloaded dumpster. &#160;Neyoka came &amp; dropped of bags of donations for the Second Thought Resale Shoppe in East Rochester. &#160;Then Barb our Landlady came &amp; I gave her the rent &amp; she got the shutter from the apartment next door to us but it was bent. &#160;She will contact Chris to tell him to replace it for it was on his time this shutter fell off the window after he painted the building. She does a prison ministry &amp; will not be with us at our Focus Fundraiser on Thursday &amp; either can Sarah for she will be at a meeting about Catholicism. &#160;She is a new Catholic at Easter time. &#160;</strong></span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br /></strong></span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>We saw many clients with many needs it must be word of mouth for we have no advertisement out front, because of our neighbors which we are suing.
