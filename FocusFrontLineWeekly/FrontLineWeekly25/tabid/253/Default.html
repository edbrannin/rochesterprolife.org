One  of our clients, who was in the fist room, overheard what this young lady was  saying &amp; then came out to tell her her testimony.&#160; She said that she was  going into Planned Parenthood &amp;

Bottom line is that she doesn’t believe abortion is  okay as birth control but doesn’t have a problem if the girl was a victim of  rape or incest.&#160; I said that abortion was ALWAYS EVIL, not just some of the  time.&#160; I said the woman who was raped &amp;/ or&#160;incest can place their baby up  for adoption &amp; get counseling.&#160; I told her that I was gang raped at Strong  Memorial Hospital &amp; miscarried twins &amp; I think of them every day.  &#160;Abortion, makes a woman wounded, for&#160;she is the victimizer &amp; her baby the  victim.&#160;&#160;I invited her, to come volunteer at Focus, if she’d like.&#160; I also  invited her to stand, at Planned Parenthood on the sidewalk with a sign, that we  have behind the bush to pray.&#160; I said if you don’t want to talk, that would be  okay, but the Holy Spirit will probably change that in time.&#160;

She also claimed that a  pro life doctor put her out &amp; then took her baby from her.&#160; Pro life doctors  don’t do abortions.&#160; She said that Planned Parenthood wouldn't put her out so  this doctor did.&#160; Martha called his office to confirm that&#160;he DOES NOT DO  ABORTIONS!!!&#160; He is an advocate for the life issues.&#160; I don’t know why she said  this awful thing to Martha?????&#160; Later on I put a prayer request out&#160;to the  people on my email list to pray for her.&#160;

said :thank you for coming back to help us”.&#160; She said “no problem  for what you do for me”.&#160; I said “I didn't do anything for you”.&#160; She said “my  twins are London &amp; England”!&#160; I said “are you kidding me”&#160; She said “no”.&#160;  Remember three years ago I was going into Planned Parenthood to have an  abortion&amp; you were on the wet sidewalk telling me not to have an abortion  &amp; that you could help me.&#160; You showed me a graphic sign of an aborted baby  &amp; talked to me again.&#160; I went home &amp; months later I had my twin  daughters. &#160;Later on that year I drove by &amp; I saw you again in front of Planned Parenthood &amp; I told you that I had  my girls &amp; I named them uncommon names, London &amp; England.&#160; You were  so happy. &#160;I was so surprised, for I didn't recognize her, for it was three years ago. &#160;I just stood there still because it was wonderful to hear what God did  through me. &#160;I am humbled by this information. &#160;It’s hard to process that anyone would kill their children but thank  God she didn't &amp; now she’s came back to Focus to give us her thanks by  helping us out.&#160; What goes around comes around!!</span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;</div><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: large;"> </span></span></p><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;&#160;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;'<strong>Listening to God'</strong></span></span><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#160;</span></span>&#160;<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;</span></span><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;</div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></span></p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Prayer should be more listening  than speaking.
