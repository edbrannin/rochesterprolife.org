no food.&#160; The next thing I did for her was to call the local Food Link for her to get&#160;food for her daughter &amp; herself.&#160; Thank God she had an apartment.&#160; I gave her a brochure &amp;

I gave her other brochures &amp; encouraged her to go to St. Mary's clinic &amp; to Food Link, which she knew where it was &amp; to call the 1-800 # at Fidelis Care.&#160; Also I need to comment that 211 was also a help to our client.&#160; This number can give you numbers of different things that you request, like food or shelters, etc..&#160; As she was leaving she stopped &amp; turned to me saying that she had gone to many places to get assistance but they all turned her down until she came to us at Focus.&#160;

He calls me “His Little Lamb.”</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>I was conceived in January of 1936. I know my mother loved me. I lived and grew under her heart. I didn’t get to know my father. Did he ever touch Mommy’s belly and feel me move inside her?&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>I lived for four months in my little cocoon. Something happened. I stopped living. There must have been sadness that day.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>I ended up in a Mason jar in a doctor’s office. I was the perfect specimen of a 4-month gestation baby. They say I was perfect in every way – even down to my tiny fingernails. Perfect, but not alive.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>So many, many years I stayed with this doctor. He got old and sold his practice to a younger doctor. I came as part of the deal. When this second doctor, got old and died, his son sold the contents of his house to a very nice couple. They found me in the basement, way back in the cobwebs, up on a shelf. They were shocked and asked the son, “What is this?” The son said, “Oh that thing…I used to take it to school for show and tell.” The nice couple, Dennis and Mary Frances Westfall, were shocked and very touched to find me. They adopted me, and brought me home to look after me. They named me baby&#160;Douglas.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>When the new priest in town came to bless their home, they explained their unusual situation to him. They wanted very much to give me a proper burial. Fr. Joe Catanise said he’d be honored to do this and the funeral plans were set into motion. First, I needed to be visited by the Sheriff’s Department. They wanted to know all kinds of things about where I came from. And the Coroner’s Office was quite curious, as well. My adopted parents were reluctant to part with me, they had come to love me so much, but they entrusted me to Fr. Joe’s good care, and I stayed a short while with him at St. Leo Church. Then I traveled to the Burger Funeral Home in town where I stayed until the day of the funeral. Mr. Burger was very gentle with me.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Two very nice ladies from St. Leo’s who are in charge of Pledge for Life, Patty Buskey and Anna Summa, made all the arrangements for my funeral to be open to the public as a way of offering closure to those who lost a child to miscarriage or abortion. Anna got me a pretty blanket to be wrapped in. It’s very soft and cuddly.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>The day of my funeral, June 5, 2010, some 74 years after I was conceived, was very special to many people…and to me. Nobody that attended my funeral really knew me. But there were 116 people who came to say good-bye to me. To pray for me and for all babies lost to miscarriage or abortion.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Fr. Joe knew early on whom the perfect priest would be to give the homily at my funeral. Fr. Anthony Mugavero, from Holy Apostles Church in Rochester, came to speak on my behalf – to help all people who had lost someone to miscarriage or abortion, to help heal their wounds. Some never had the chance to remember their lost child in a Mass. So my funeral Mass was really also for all of them. It was called a Mass for the Unborn. Anna and Patty advertised my funeral and invited all those who had lost a child in this way. It was an opportunity for them to find closure.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>My funeral Mass began with pretty flowers at the altar, and I was in a simple, but beautiful little white casket. I was wrapped snugly in my soft little blanket. I was right up front. And there were two soldiers in fancy hats and capes and carrying swords, as a sort of honor guard for me. They were called Knights of Columbus. It made me feel very special.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>The music was so moving. The St. Leo Resurrection Choir sang beautifully and led everyone in the hymns chosen just for me. I waited so long for this. To think that the Music Director, Patty Gorman, who had lost a baby many years ago, played so lovingly for me. It must have been very sad for her. She sounded like an angel.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Mr. Burger printed up prayer cards for me and he and Fr.

Mugavero spoke so beautifully about love, and that every child is a gift of God. How life is so precious, whether born or unborn. His words were so gentle and kind. He sang the words from a song by a singer named John Denver. “I want to live, I want to grow, I want to see, and I want to know, I want to share what I could give, I want to be, I want to live….” That says everything I would want to say. What could I have become if my life was allowed to develop?&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>But my coming to being, however short that time was, had a purpose - if for no other reason but to be found and be loved enough to be honored by this funeral. My existence was to help those, who have lost their dear babies, to have closure. I’m proud of that.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>The folks from Burger Funeral Home found a perfect place for me to rest in the Parma Union Cemetery. The good people who are in charge of the cemetery donated my special place. It’s next to a little girl who was born one year after I was conceived. She lived for six days. I think we will be good friends. I overheard someone at my new home say this funeral helped her have closure for a child she lost. I’m happy for that.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Every life, no matter how well lived, matters to our God. He never forgets His creations. He had a purpose for my life, as short as it was. If I have helped one person by my short existence, I have not lived in vain. God bless all the babies.

children's clothes.&#160; The mom had 7 children, 6 girls &amp; 1boy.&#160; She came into get some clothes for her family &amp; for&#160;her new grand baby, who is 16 weeks old, in her daughter's womb.&#160; The new mom took some baby blankets &amp; some other things, for she doesn't know&#160;if she's going to have a little boy or girl, at this time.&#160; She said that she was going next week for an ultrasound that will determine the sex of the baby.&#160; I told her that when she finds out that she can come back for baby clothes, at that time.&#160; It was a great moment&#160; celebrating 'life' of our past 2 clients.&#160; Very refreshing helping these new moms, rather than&#160;them going into Planned Parenthood, to have their precious babies be murdered by Rachael Phelps, the abortionist there.&#160;

That was far, if she didn't then she didn't but I did.&#160; So it was his word against my word, &amp; that's that.&#160; He latter apologized for what he said to me with the prompting of Martha who said that we should all just get along.&#160; Blessed are the peace makers.&#160; So he started to approach me &amp; I backed off &amp; accepted his apology from a far.&#160; That'll do.&#160; To say the least it was a very stressful time that was most unexpected, in the center.&#160;

He them looked at me sternly &amp; said "I asked how&#160;YOU were doing"!.&#160; Oh me, how am I doing, terrible I confessed.&#160; "What's wrong", he said.&#160; "Oh I have&#160; Fibromyalgia</strong> </font><a href="http://www.fmaware.org/site/PageServer"><strong><font size="4">http://www.fmaware.org/site/PageServer</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;besides other things going on, to many to mention".&#160; He said "is this an Autoimmune condition?".&#160; "I guess so", I&#160;replied&#160; "What are you doing for it", he said?&#160; I said "nothing, I don't know what to do for it,&#160;I can't take pain pills all my life, I'll ruin my liver, so I just offer my pain &amp; discomfort up to the Lord to use it to save lives &amp; souls, including my own, &amp; He gives me the grace to endure it".&#160; "I'll be fine" I said, I receive the Sacrament of the Sick every month, that's my medicine &amp; try to go to daily Mass &amp; receive the Holy Eucharist, that's my medicine.&#160; Plus read the Bible &amp; say the Rosary, that's my medicine too.&#160; He's Catholic, so I know that he understood, what I was saying.&#160;

When her mother, on her death bed, asked her to forgive her for what she did, she replied "no, I only hope that my baby, that you killed, will forgive you".&#160; She was crying like a baby.&#160; I got up &amp; gave her a hug &amp; a Kleenex.&#160; My heart went out to her for the loss, of her baby,&#160;&amp; for the betrayal, of her own mother.&#160; She said that her own mother wanted to abort her but was talked out of it &amp; that her grandmother raised her, for most of her life.&#160; What loss, pain &amp; rejection.&#160; My heart went out to her, for I related.&#160; Then she said that she had some children &amp; then had her Fallopian tubes tied.&#160; A couple of years later she thought that she could be pregnant so she went to Strong Hospital to get&#160;a pregnancy test.&#160; It was positive.&#160; The female doctor told her that she had an infection &amp; that she needed to take 'this pill'.&#160; She told her that she would when se got home.&#160;The doctor said "no, you need to take it now".&#160; So she did &amp; off she went home thinking that she had an infection &amp; all will be well.&#160; No so, not so.&#160; The next day she started to bleed &amp; all 'this stuff' came out of me, she said.&#160; Then she new that she was pregnant &amp; that the doctor had given her an abortion pill.&#160;

when she came out in the early afternoon there we were, on the front lines.&#160; She said that she saw our graphic sign of the 10 week old aborted baby &amp; she knew that was her baby, that she just paid the abortionist Rachael Phelps to murder, in cold blood.&#160;

healing, from God &amp; her precious baby, that was killed that awful abortion day.&#160; My heart is very sad that we can't get anyone to be out in front of Planned Parenthood on Tuesday &amp; Thursday mornings.&#160; I will say that Pat &amp; Bill do pray, the Rosary, for an hour on Tuesday mornings, so it seemed that this woman came after they left, to have the abortion.&#160; We should have pro lifers there, in front of Planned Parenthood, every day &amp; all day long too.&#160; What's wrong with this picture?&#160; Why are good people so docile when it comes to abortion, which effects us all, in this country?&#160;&#160;Abortion is&#160;the murdering of an innocent&#160;human being, that is totally dependent on the mother, in the womb, where it should be safe. &#160;This cancer, of abortion,&#160;has hit home to all of us, either directly or indirectly.&#160;

Oh yea, he or she does.&#160; Through the grace&#160;of God it&#160;took me about 10 minutes to convince them to follow me into the Focus Center where Suzanne awaited to&#160;counsel them or anyone else I brought in to her.&#160;

said something to me but they were to far away tfor me to hear what the one girl was saying.&#160; They both went into Planned Parenthood &amp; were there for awhile.&#160; When they came back out the one girl, who was the passenger, said something to me &amp; again&#160;I was to far away to hear what she was saying.&#160; I was now by myself for Bill had to go.&#160;The car was coming out of the parking lot&#160;&amp; it&#160;stopped &amp; the young girl, who was the passenger said to me,&#160;"why are you hear? &#160;I'm a Christian so shut your blank, blank, mouth".&#160; I said "no, you're not Christian maybe a pretend one but not a real one for&#160;a real Christian&#160;wouldn't speak that way".&#160; Just then my cell phone rang &amp; I said to her "just a minute I have to get this".&#160; Believe it or not they waited&#160;until I got off the phone&#160;&amp; then she continued to say "why don't you leave these girls alone you blank, blank".&#160; I then said to her "your tongue is going to fall out, you need your mouth cleaned up".&#160; Off they went into the sunset, only kidding but they finally did leave &amp; went up the street towards E. Main St..&#160; 'The End', so I thought but I was wrong.&#160; About a half hour later a&#160;car was coming very close to where I was standing on the sidewalk &amp; I said "be careful, you're to close".

I called the center to ask if Suzanne could ring me put a bottle of water, not to throw at anyone, but to cleanse my right eye out.&#160; She did &amp; I then splashed&#160;it on my right eye, to rinse it out.&#160; You should have seen the guy in the parking lot of the business right next door, the look on his face was priceless.&#160; I wonder what he thought I was doing with the water.&#160; He'll never know.&#160; Thanks Suzanne for saving the day!!</font></strong></p><div><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">I looked down the street &amp; I saw an elderly man walking up the street with a large can in his hands, it looked like a paint can hut as he drew closer to me I <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/murphye/map%20project/old-man-laughing.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 92px; float: left; height: 68px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:DtvkjjvqYNewaM:http://www.stolaf.edu/people/murphye/map%20project/old-man-laughing.jpg" /></a>saw that it up an open can that was empty.&#160; I looked the other way briefly &amp; when I turned back I saw that he was seated on the wooden ledge that surrounds Planned Parenthood's bushes. He mumbled a comment, about the graphic picture of the aborted baby, who was massacred by abortion, that was straight from Hell &amp; for the first time ever, out on the front lines, I said for him to "shut up".&#160; I had the crucifix &amp; earlier I had said the Hail Mary prayer &amp; the St. Michael the Archangel prayer, against the Evil One, now I was praying in tongues.&#160; All of a sudden he is using a demonic voice &amp; in a different <img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 84px; float: left; height: 60px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:8icCa4Tx6NWdaM:http://freethoughts.org/archives/police.jpg" />language.&#160; It was straight from the Exorcist movie.&#160; I said "you have two seconds to leave before I call the police".&#160; He immediately stood&#160;up &amp; walked up the street to where ever.&#160; This was another spittle attack against life, three times in less then 2 hours.&#160; Thank you Lord Jesus for protecting me against the attacks from the Evil One.<br /><br />
Since I had Suzanne on the sidewalk &amp; a few minutes later Elaine came to bring the chairs to the center I asked them both since it was around 4pm to help me carry the signs &amp; literature box into the center, which they did. So God sent me 2 people to help me.&#160; I was now in the center &amp; Rose was helping another mother out in the Material Aid Room.&#160; We served 6 moms on Tuesday &amp; Wednesday &amp; today, Thursday many more.&#160; I was settling in when the doorbell rang.&#160; I went to the door to see three young girls at the door.&#160; I opened the door &amp; asked if I cold help them.&#160; The one girl said "I'd like a <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.watercolorsbymarian.com/Sold/StoneMtn3Girls.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="57" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:LAiw5Q6n6Nx7lM:http://www.watercolorsbymarian.com/Sold/StoneMtn3Girls.jpg" /></a>pregnancy test, then the other girl said "I want a pregnancy test" &amp; the other girl said "I need one too".&#160; I invited them into the center &amp; asked "how are you all related"?&#160; The one girl said "we're all sisters". Something is wrong with this family dynamics.&#160; I was glad that they came to the Focus Center where they will be safe &amp; so will their children be too, if they are pregnant.&#160; I brought them into the Rose Room &amp; because there were three girls I asked them to fill out their own Intake Sheet.&#160; I spoke with the girls &amp; hem started to do the pregnancy tests.&#160; The one sister was pregnant.&#160; She was 15 years old &amp; said that she's been dating her boyfriend for 5 years.&#160; What!!&#160; She's been dating him since she was 10 years old. Where was her parents??&#160; She was open for life &amp; so where her 2 sisters for they were excited in being Aunts &amp; had already named the baby after them.&#160; I spoke to the other two girls about abstinence.&#160; The one girl said that she was going to now save herself for her husband.&#160; The other sister hopefully will follow suit.&#160; I said to them not to try to get pregnant because your sister is expecting just enjoy being Aunts.&#160; They agreed. The one girl was hungry so I went &amp; got each of them a snack &amp;&#160;a&#160;bottle of water. They all took a Truth packet &amp; I gave them the Growth &amp; Development DVD &amp; the 12 week of rubberized baby to take with them to witness to others.&#160; I asked them to keep away from Planned Parenthood &amp; they said that they were just over there today, probably just after I left to come into the center, &amp; they told them <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.forparentsbyparents.com/images/pregnancy_diary/anita_baby_2_1007.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="107" height="79" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:LKN5nIdS0U0CIM:http://www.forparentsbyparents.com/images/pregnancy_diary/anita_baby_2_1007.jpg" /></a>that unless they were willing to terminate they wouldn't do a pregnancy test so they saw our sign on the sidewalk &amp; came to Focus for assistance.&#160; Which I'm glad that they did, thank God.&#160; I asked what their parents would say about this news &amp; the pregnant girl said that she will be all right with it &amp; so will her boyfriend.&#160; I said to her&#160;don't let anyone talk&#160;you into an abortion &amp; she said that she wouldn't let anyone talk her into it.&#160; This was good news.&#160; I said for them to call me if they needed any assistance, for I'm only a phone call away.&#160; I showed them the Material Aid Room &amp; said for her to come back to get some nice things for her baby when she finds out if her baby is a girl or boy.&#160; She said "thank you &amp; I will".&#160; I gave them Compass Care's phone number for an ultrasound &amp; for STD testing which the other girls were inquiring about.&#160; I hope that today their lives will change for the better &amp; to make good choices for themselves, from now on.&#160; A 'new life' was left alone&#160;to grow &amp; be born, next year.&#160; Yeah!! These girls were young &amp; I hope &amp; pray like all our girls that their parents will do better in showing good example &amp; to teach their children better &amp; how to respect their bodies &amp;

the drop clothes &amp; the ladder so Jerry &amp; I waited.&#160; He really didn't want to do it so I argued with him until he said "yes".&#160; Frank came back with all the paint stuff &amp; left then Jerry &amp; I argued a bit more &amp; he told me to just go, so I did, I went into the new Great Room &amp; took a 2 hour nap, among all the noise that woke me up about 10 times but I finally woke up refreshed to say the least.&#160; I went into the other room &amp; exclaimed what a great job Jerry did!&#160; Even though it needed a second coat in some spots &amp; he touched up the other wall even though it wasn't the same shade of green, but whose complaining.&#160; I'll deal with all of that another day &amp; time.&#160; At least the room will be ready for the '40 Days for Life' Kick Off Rally tomorrow night, thank God.&#160; Jerry left to go to church &amp; I made a couple of phone calls first, before the noon Mass,&#160;one was to the carpet man Jason who knocked off $50 for our accountant's room, up the hall, because he got out all his furniture instead of the carpet men having to do it.&#160; Yeah!&#160; Then I called the landlord to ask him to come pick up the remnant rugs in the all purpose room&#160;&amp; that I had his favorite drink for him as a thank you.&#160; Enjoy <a id="thumbnail" href="http://prospect.rsc.org/blogs/cw/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/white-wine-bottle-istock_000002946780large.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="53" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

When I arrived at the center I saw two girls waiting for me.&#160; I let them in, one of the girls is our client, she brought in her friend for a pregnancy test.&#160; As I was doing the test, she who is due in January, was freely shopping in our Material Aid Room, having a ball.&#160; The pregnancy test &amp; teaching was completed, then our newest client went into the Material Aid Room, to do some shopping for her 2 year daughter.&#160; They both left very happy.&#160; I asked our&#160;client to get me some brochures from Healthy Moms program, next to St. Mary's &amp;

didn't have a chance to get out on the front line until about 1:30pm, which broke my heart.&#160; Being on the front lines is a matter of life &amp; death, for the little ones.&#160; It was frustrating, but we had several moms come in to receive baby &amp; children clothes &amp; diapers, which was important.&#160; Sandy was there to help them for Rose didn't show up today, hope she is okay.&#160; Donna called in sick, so she wasn't going to be there today on the front lines, &amp; Mary S. is celebrating her 25th. Wedding Anniversary &amp; is in California for 2 weeks.&#160; So it was just Martha &amp; I out on the front lines.&#160; Jerry showed up much later, to pray.&#160; Rick the '40 Days for Life' Coordinator came &amp; around 1:10pm to start to set up for the rally at 5:30pm.&#160; I was doing so many things that my head began to spin.&#160; Well, Martha &amp; I finally went out on the front lines.&#160; I saw that the abortionist Rachael Phelps wasn't there but there could have been another abortionist there to take her place.&#160; You just have to treat everyone like they were here for an abortion so as not to miss anyone, until you're told differently by the person.&#160; Well that happened.&#160; A car came out &amp; stopped along side of us.&#160;&#160;I popped my head&#160;near the car &amp; began to witness what Planned Parenthood&#160;does in there.&#160; They listened to both Martha &amp; I.&#160; I gave them a Truth packet &amp; a DVD on Black Genocide,&#160; The young girl &amp; guy were all so nice &amp; asked for a&#160;doctors name.&#160; I went over to the literature box &amp; got out our small list of pro life doctors to give to her.&#160; She looked at it &amp; said that 2 of the doctors would work.&#160; Yeah!&#160; They&#160;said "thank you"&#160;&amp; then went into the vets parking lot to turn around.&#160;&#160;We waved at them as they passed by us &amp; they waved back to Martha &amp; I.&#160; &#160;They were open to the Truth, thank God, so now they have a 'New Beginning', through the grace of God.&#160;

We've had trouble with guys on skate boards before.&#160; They have spit on our signs &amp; crashed into them &amp; were nasty as they rode by us, so I was ready with my&#160;cell phone for anything.&#160; They disappeared&#160;as they were crossing Gibbs St. pass our strip mall were we have our pregnancy center.&#160;&#160;Bye boys just grow up &amp; keep your nasty mouths closed.&#160; No respect for 'life' which they enjoy.&#160; Well I was wrong.&#160; It was about 20 minutes later that one of the&#160;boys came passed Martha &amp; I on his skate board mouthing off, right in front of us.&#160; &#160;I wasn't going to mess around so I pretended to call the police right in front of him.&#160; He quickly went down Wayland St. &amp; disappeared, hopefully never for us to see him again, until he repents.&#160; I love this scare method for it usually works.&#160; Only 2 times in all my years it didn't work the abusers just stayed there until&#160;I could think up another way to get rid of them harassing us.&#160;

Then he said&#160;"Mary I'm going to call Fr. O'Malley to have him do an exorcist".&#160; I called back to him saying "please get some new material, while trying to insult me, this is old stuff".&#160; Just&#160;before this happened, my sweet friend Donna arrived, with her darling daughter Hannah who is 14 months old.&#160; She&#160;didn't like what she heard him say to me so she decided to walk across the street &amp; speak to him.&#160; When she came back about 10 minutes later,&#160;all she said was, "Mary we'll have to pray for him".&#160; I guess he was in the war &amp;&#160;is confused to what we're all about in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; He&#160;said that he was a Christian.&#160;All I&#160;can say is that some one has failed him in his Church.&#160; After Donna left&#160;I went across the street to see Jerry, who was on his knees praying, holding a crucifix, praying to end abortion.&#160;&#160;Then I heard Jim say "Mary now what are you doing"?&#160; I just stayed there &amp; prayed.&#160; I&#160;did say&#160;"God will take care of you".&#160; He quivered at that statement.&#160; All I mean is that God&#160;doesn't want you to persecute your brother or sister in the Lord &amp; He loves those who He disciplines.&#160; It wasn't a curse or anything like that.&#160; We are all responsible with what we say &amp; do &amp; not do, including myself.&#160; I have to forgive him, for that's what it is in being a Christian.&#160;</span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><div><span style="font-size: medium">A skuffy older man came walking up the street &amp; he stopped to tell me that when he was 21 years old, his 17 year old girlfriend got pregnant, &amp; she wanted an abortion.&#160; He talked her out of it &amp; his daughter is 37 years old now.&#160; Thank God for him talking action in saving his daughter's life.&#160;This is great news!!&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><div><span style="font-size: small">I was standing on the sidewalk when I saw that a young woman had just come out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I hollered over to her offering her the Truth packet.&#160; She walked over to me, with no expression on her face &amp; I smiled at her &amp; gave her the packet without saying a word, I asked her no questions, which was very unusual for me.&#160; Nothing came out of my mouth.

I cried &amp; then walked slowly back to the front lines to be with Martha &amp; Carole.&#160; We discussed this situation.&#160; I went to the computer, in the Focus Center's office, to email everyone so that they would pray for her &amp; her precious, innocent baby.&#160; They did.&#160; The rest of the day was very difficult for I had no way to reach her.&#160; I didn't ask for her to fill out an Intake Sheet because &amp; I didn't want her to get up &amp; leave.&#160; She, if she needed me to reach me anytime, that she knew.&#160; So it was up to her to contact me or not.&#160; Talk about suffering, for the Lord.&#160; If&#160;the Lord&#160;needed this kind of suffering then so be it to save the lives of both mother &amp; child.&#160; </strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>The rest of this day was very difficult.&#160;

the one mom was due soon with a baby girl.&#160; Between the 2 moms they had 12 children between them.&#160; Needless&#160;to say that they took a lot of things emptying 3 baskets of clothes.&#160; Martha helped them in the room &amp; told the kids to pick up the toys, that they had put on the floor before leaving, which they did.&#160; They took at least 3 full bags of clothes, which is fine, for their&#160;families.&#160; We are here to help.</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>The&#160;three Elim Institute Students came today &amp;

This way we could stretch our diaper supply so we can always have enough for all our moms who come in for them.&#160; We are working on a Grant &amp; also for Wegmans, to help the center out, with diapers, baby wipes &amp; formula.&#160; So much to do &amp; hardly no time to do it all.&#160; We ran out of plastic bags &amp; Helen went out to purchase more for us.&#160; Sandy, who helps us out on Tuesdays in the center,&#160;had just come in for a visit &amp; she went with her to the Dollar General on Main St., she was glad of that&#160;for she doesn't live in Rochester but she said that she had a good sense of direction.&#160; Better you than me, that's for sure.&#160; They came back&#160;about 20 minutes later with 8 cartons of plastic bags.&#160; Thanks so very much Helen.&#160; The girls kept on going, going &amp; going some more.&#160; No one came in to the Material Aid Room for clothes until after they left.&#160;&#160;Maybe next week&#160;girls, for the experience.&#160;

I recognized her immediately &amp; she approached us.&#160; All this happened so fast my head was spinning.&#160; She said to me that Planned Parenthood won't give her anesthesia for the abortion so she wanted the pills to be taken out.&#160; Oh my God it's happening!!&#160; I quickly brought her to the center where Suzanne, our&#160;Thursday counselor&#160;was, &amp; asked her to call the doctor to tell him that we were on our way.&#160; Our regular doctor was out of town though so we called our other referral doctor.&#160; He said to bring her right over.&#160; I asked Martha to come with me for my legs were like jelly.&#160; She told the other people, that were on the sidewalk praying, that she was&#160;leaving &amp; for them to take over &amp; off we went to the doctors office who is off of Genesee St..&#160; The&#160;traffic was horrible, poor Martha was stopping at every light it seemed &amp; there was road work ahead of us.&#160; At one point the young lady said that she wanted to go home until Martha told her that women&#160;can die from these&#160;pills.&#160; She said "how".&#160; I quickly told her that they&#160;bleed to death.&#160; She changed her mind about going home &amp; we were at the doctors office&#160;about 10 minutes later.&#160; We all got out of the car &amp; went into the office where they took her to the back room to wait for the doctor, who was there ready to 'save a life'.&#160; Martha &amp; I waited in the waiting room until I couldn't stand the stress any longer &amp; decided to go for a walk down Warwick Ave. which is right next to the doctors office.&#160; I wanted to see the house where I lived when I was 6 years old&#160;when I was in second grade at St. Augustine's Catholic Church, which is now closed.&#160; I made my First Holy Communion at that church.&#160; I walked gingerly down the street looking at every house to find the one that I lived in.&#160; I saw an elderly Black woman sweeping her driveway &amp; decided to stop to talk to her.&#160; This encounter was such a joy to my heart.&#160; A wise &amp; wonderful woman she was.&#160; I told her that I once lived on this street about 54 years ago.&#160; She said that she didn't live there then&#160;even though she has been there for many years.&#160; She said that she lost her husband about 7 years ago &amp; once worked at Strong in the Labor Room helping to deliver babies.&#160; I asked if she assisted with abortions &amp; she said "no baby, I wouldn't have done that".&#160; Don't you love her.&#160; Her next door neighbor came out &amp; joined us.&#160; I spoke with her for a few minutes &amp; asked her to take care of Gwen, that was her name, &amp; she said that she does.&#160; I smiled &amp; was happy to hear this.&#160; I said "good bye &amp; God bless" &amp; continued to walk down the street to find the house.&#160; I did.&#160; I just stood there looking up at the window that was once&#160;my bedroom.&#160; It was a duplex &amp; we lived upstairs.&#160; I just keep on looking &amp; the people who were sitting on their porch next door started to look at me.&#160; I said to them that I used to live in this house when I was 6 years old &amp;&#160;I asked them&#160;some questions &amp; they answered me.&#160; I was afraid to leave Martha in the doctors office by herself for very long so I looked at the neighbors &amp; said "what happened in this house shouldn't have happened to any child", for&#160;I&#160;was molested, by my father, in that house.&#160; I walked back to the doctors to be with Martha.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">We waited for the procedure of the pills to be taken out for about 45 minutes &amp; we were talking to the patients that were waiting for the doctor not knowing what was going on, for he took our girl right away.&#160; He came out of the examining room &amp; I spoke with him &amp; he said to pray for her &amp; her baby.&#160; I said that was a given &amp; thanked him for taking her right away.&#160; He said "no problem" &amp; he walked back into the examining room.&#160; She came out about 10 minutes later.&#160; I asked her how she was doing &amp; she said that she felt better&#160;once the pills were removed.&#160; I was glad to hear his.&#160; I thanked the office people for their cooperation in this urgent matter &amp; said good bye &amp; we all left.&#160; When we got into the car our young lady said "I need a cigarette".&#160; You got to be kidding, I thought, not another way to wreck this baby.&#160; She was so&#160;stressed out that Martha &amp; I thought, that this once, it might be better to let her have one, so&#160;I bought a pack of cigarette's &amp; gave her&#160;just 1.&#160; I went into a corner store on W. Main St. &amp; asked for a pack of Newports &amp; this young person appeared.&#160; I asked him how old he was &amp; he said 15.&#160; I said that I didn't think that 15 year olds were to suppose to sell cigarette's.&#160; He said that it was okay &amp; if it wasn't he'd still do it.&#160; That's another problem for another day. &#160;(Days later I spoke to my police friend &amp; he said that it was illegal &amp; it can reported it to the Dept.of Tobacco Firearms and Alcohol) &#160;&#160;She smoked it in the car with the window down.&#160; As we were driving down Hudson Ave. the street where they shoot people all the time she asked for Martha to stop to get chicken wings.&#160; Are you kidding I thought to myself.&#160; Martha said "yes just&#160;tell me where to stop".&#160; Well she was a help!!&#160; The fun never stops!&#160; We stopped at a&#160;Chinese Take Out that had chicken wings of course.&#160; Her &amp; I got out of the car while Martha was waiting in the car.&#160; She put in an order &amp; so did I for at this time Martha &amp; I were hungry too.&#160; While she was waiting for her order to come up a little girl around 7 years old waved at her.&#160; She made a comment saying "see the little girl she just waved at me &amp; I don't even know her".&#160;&#160;The Lord was showing her the love of a child, to soften her heart for her child growing inside of her.&#160;&#160;We then took her home with the understanding for her to call us if she needed&#160;anything &amp; to call the doctor, in a couple of days,&#160;to schedule an ultrasound &amp; exam.&#160; She said that she would do it.&#160;&#160;Martha &amp; I drove back to the center to eat our Chinese chicken wings &amp; they were good.&#160; What a day as we praised God for all that He did through us, to save the life of His children, both hers &amp; her baby's.&#160; We told everyone, who were still praying, in front of Planned Parenthood,&#160;to pray some more for this situation &amp; I sent out a prayer request to&#160;my email list also.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div><div><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: #0000ff">Friday, September 24, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: small">I received a call from our new client Ms. C. &amp;

I said that I am the director of a pregnancy center.&#160; She said that she has taken in pregnant girls in her home.&#160; I was so happy to hear this &amp; I took down her name &amp; phone number, so when our new mom called saying that she needed to find a place to live temporally I though of her.&#160; I called her &amp; she said for me to come to look at the room this evening at 7pm.&#160; I called Ms. C &amp; set up a time to pick her up to take her to see the room.&#160; I picked her &amp; her girlfriend &amp; Ms.C around 6:30pm &amp; drove them over to see the house off of St. Paul Blvd..&#160; When&#160;we arrived we were greeted by Beverly &amp; she showed us the room upstairs.&#160; The room was very small but durable to the situation.&#160; Then she said that she had a male tenant down the short hall.&#160; She&#160;assured us&#160;that there would be no privacy issue but I felt uncomfortable with this surprise.&#160; I remembered that she said that there was another room downstairs so I asked to see this room.&#160; The room was off of the kitchen &amp; had a powder room next to it.&#160; It was by the back door which a porch, which was nice.&#160; Beverly had no real rules to live in her home.&#160; No curfew &amp; your own key, just clean up after yourself which was a given.&#160; This seemed like a wonderful place for our Ms. C to move into to get away from the chaos where she is now for her sake &amp; that of her baby.&#160; I &amp; she &amp; her friend were very happy.&#160; Ms. C told Beverly that she will take it &amp; asked when she could move in.&#160; Beverly said how about Sunday at 2pm, we all agreed.&#160; We thanked Beverly &amp; left.&#160; The girls were hungry so I stopped at Price Rite in a very bad neighbor because that's were is was, at least they had a policeman there walking around.&#160; Oh boy!!</span></div></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span><div><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: medium">Sunday,&#160;September 27, 2010</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Ms. C. made arrangements to move into the house that we went to on Friday.&#160;

When she drove into the parking lot&#160;I noticed that her front right head light was out.&#160; We debated what to do but figured that if she&#160;drives carefully&#160;we will be all right, until she can get it fixed the next day.&#160; We took her car because it's bigger &amp; holds more because Ms. C will be bringing all what she owns with her to the new place from her old home, otherwise we would have taken my smaller car.&#160; We then picked up Ms. C with all her heavy bags &amp; suitcases &amp; we were off to her new beginning in her life once she decided to 'chose life' &amp; had the RU 486 abortion pills taken out of her.&#160; Martha &amp; I were happy for her.&#160; Well things can change real fast in life so always be ready but always trust in God for He is in control &amp;

&#160;Martha was backing&#160;out of the driveway &amp; almost hit the tree behind her, she tried several times to straightened out until she told me to put my head down, which I did then she got out of the driveway safely.&#160;

We were surrounded &amp; the flashlights were now shinning in the car looking for whatever, which we don't do.&#160; Martha rolled down the window, to a woman police officer which meant business, which I can't blame her in that neighborhood but if you look at Martha all you see is sweetness, until she told me to shut up because I was laughing i<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.myorkutglitter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/i-m-sorry.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="80" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

registration &amp; insurance card which she did &amp; then asked her if she new why she was being stopped.&#160; Martha told her it was because of her front headlight which was out &amp; that&#160;she just found out about tonight &amp; couldn't do anything about it until tomorrow.&#160; The officer went back to her car to check out Martha &amp; then came back with a ticket &amp; told her that if she gets her car fixed tomorrow that she could send the proof in to get the ticket taken away.&#160; Sounded good to Martha who was about to scream, with all that had taken place in such a short period of time late at night, &amp; the night wasn't over with yet.&#160; After the police had left to fight crime on the streets of Rochester, which is very dangerous &amp; our prayers are with them, you could hear a pin drop in the car.&#160; I don't remember if we talked at all but I think that we did.&#160; We got to the center safe &amp; sound &amp; I got out &amp; thanked Martha for all that she did this evening &amp;

We are not out here to traumatize the children but to save the children from being murdered by Rachael Phelps &amp; all others at Planned Parenthood through chemical &amp; surgical abortions.&#160; What these pictures does is to convict the adults who blame it on the children.&#160; It's called transference.&#160; Tucker when he came tried to talk to her, so did Carole &amp; Linda, but the lady just kept on going like the,&#160;generalized bunny. &#160;The neighbor Sue Bovay came out to look to see what was going on, poor lady.&#160;

it was one of our clients who is due any day now with her mother.&#160; They came to pick up the car seat that we got for the baby.&#160; I was surprised to see them because I told them I would be there from 1-8pm but this worked out well.&#160; I invited them into the Material Aid Room to pick up some more things for her baby girl, who will soon join us in this world.&#160; Praise God, for this mom was going into Planned Parenthood about 7 months ago, to have an abortion &amp; changed her mind after I showed her the graphic sign Malachi &amp; gave her a Truth packet.&#160; I didn't know that she changed her mind until about 3 weeks ago.&#160; Thank you Lord!&#160; She is the friend of our newest client that had the RU 486 abortion pills taken out of her more than a week ago, that Martha &amp;&#160;I brought her to our doctor for the removal, &amp;

Well that never happened.&#160; I called our client &amp; she couldn't come until tomorrow so I decided to wait until later tonight to pick up the items so I emailed Maria about the change of plans.&#160; The Lord had another plan for this day.&#160; I was expecting Tim to come to set up the bassinet for another one of our clients &amp; to give Martha &amp; I a ham &amp; turkey sub for lunch.&#160; Both came to pass.&#160; I went out to see if the abortionist, Rachael Phelps was there &amp; she was.&#160; As I was walking back to the center &amp; approached a young girl &amp; asked if she needed any assistance.&#160; She said that she needed a pregnancy test so I asked her follow me into the center to get on, she did.&#160; I called to Martha to ask her if she would assist this young lady &amp; she said that she would.&#160; Ironically she knew her from the past.&#160; Tony &amp; Joy who are husband &amp; wife came in to talk to Martha &amp; I for a few minutes &amp; then took some graphic signs &amp; went out to the front lines while I worked at my desk for a few minutes of catch up, but not for long.&#160; The doorbell rang&#160; then Martha had stuck her head into the office to tell me that a couple with 2 children were in the Material Aid Room to get some clothes &amp; she was busy doing a pregnancy test.&#160; No problem Martha.&#160; I got up &amp; went into the Material Aid Room &amp; there was Tony &amp; a woman &amp; a man &amp; 2 young girls around 2 &amp; 3 years old, in a stroller.&#160; Then Tony said to me that she had an appointment at Planned Parenthood on Tuesday,&#160;my heart almost dropped.&#160; I turned to her &amp; asked her for what.&#160; She said to me so matter of a fact tone of voice,&#160;which ripped my flesh, to have an abortion.&#160; I looked right at her &amp; said "no you're not going to kill your baby".&#160; The man with her said something to her in Spanish, oh no, I thought.&#160;&#160;I might not understand Spanish but I certainly can read faces &amp; I didn't like what I saw in his.&#160; I spoke to them both &amp; then he said "it's not my baby".&#160; Lord have Mercy!&#160; I said that it didn't matter whose baby it was that this child was created by God, on loan to you both, to take care of, so work it out.&#160; Martha was finished with the client in the Rose Room so she brought them into the room to speak to them both.&#160; She was with them counseling them for about 15 minutes.&#160; When they came out I continued to speak to them too.&#160; They were given many brochures &amp; DVD's one was the movie Bella &amp; I showed them pictures of aborted babies to which they both reacted to.&#160; I gave them food &amp; diapers for their daughters, from the Material Aid Room &amp; told then that we would help them with their needs.&#160; Martha read to them the poem 'My Life Depends One You, which the mother reacted emotionally.&#160; Then Martha said to the man who still stated that this was not his baby by saying "have you ever made a mistake"?&#160; He bet his head &amp; then the wife said "oh yea you have two other children by another woman &amp; then he said oh yea you have a child in Peru".&#160; What a mess!&#160; Then Martha stated to them, with her hands up, "well then, you're one happy family"!!&#160; As they were leaving I said to the woman that you could die from the abortion for women have, which is a well kept secret.&#160; She just looked at me &amp; they left.&#160; Well, they were given lots of information to ponder.&#160;

not the baby".&#160; She said that he was crazy, so I rest my case.&#160; Well they never showed up &amp; we were there from 9:15am until 4:30pm &amp; we didn't see them going in or coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Yeah!&#160; But the abortionist killed many babies that day.&#160; The girls were slumped down in the either the front or back seats of the cars driving them out.&#160; One car even had 2 children in it.&#160; They lost a brother or a sister &amp; was brought to the very place, by they parents, that killed him or her.&#160; It's enough to make you sick &amp; it does.&#160; I told the father that he put a curse on his family &amp; killed generations with this abortion.&#160; They just look at you, wait &amp; see!!&#160; We pleaded with the mothers to 'chose life' &amp; that we could help them &amp; that their baby had a heartbeat &amp; deserves a birthday &amp; not a death day.&#160; They deserved to be protected &amp; not harmed.&#160; I call the abortionist &amp; the workers at Planned Parenthood "bullies" &amp; tell them to pick on someone their own size.&#160;

Martha called to her asking if she would like a 'free' stroller.&#160; She hollered from across the street "yes" &amp; started to cross the street over to where Martha &amp; I were standing by the bushes.&#160; As the young girl was walking she saw the graphic signs &amp; said "oh no" then she saw another picture &amp; said "oh no" &amp; walked over to another &amp; said "oh no", as we were trying to turn the pictures around so she couldn't see them.&#160; The mother was not alarmed that her daughter saw the pictures &amp; followed Martha into the Material Aid Room for clothing.&#160; When she came back out to be with me, for at that time it was just Martha &amp; myself, later on Tony &amp; Joyce &amp; Lynda came to join us, she told me what had happened to this young mother yesterday.&#160; She was walking down on of the inner city street by herself &amp; was jumped by a guy who beat her up &amp; stole her purse with all her ID in it.&#160; When she crossed over the street I didn't see her face for I was looking at the little girls reaction to the signs.&#160; The <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/2417887/2/istockphoto_2417887-stitches.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

she had to go to the Emergency Room for stitches yesterday &amp; was hidden by a hood &amp; scarf.&#160; Martha said that she took the stroller &amp; will come back later on to get the&#160;other things that her little girl wanted, she had to go to the police department to fill out some more forms.&#160; Well she kept her promise &amp; came back about 2 hours later, to get the things in the center that she wanted.&#160; As they were coming down the sidewalk the little girl, who was in the stroller, put both of her hands up in the air when she saw Martha.&#160; It was sooo cute &amp; heartwarming to behold.&#160; They went back into the Material Aid Room to finish the deal.&#160; When they came out they walked passed me.&#160; The mom stopped to say hi to me &amp; the little girl saw the mega phone that I was holding &amp; said "I want that".&#160; I looked at her &amp; said "no honey".&#160; Then she said it again "I want that" &amp; pointed to the mega phone that I was holding.&#160; Again I said "no sweetheart, that's not for little girls".&#160; Then she tried to turn around the graphic sign, that I had turned around, so that she couldn't see it.&#160; I thought to myself&#160;'you little dickens'.&#160; Then the mom said in a quiet voice "she tired &amp; needs a nap".&#160; As they were walking away I heard the little girl say in a loud voice "I'M NOT TIRED".&#160;&#160; I said to them, "Bye Bye".&#160; In all my years I never&#160;met a child so young&#160;with such a strong&#160; personality as she had.&#160;&#160; She'll keep the mom busy that's for sure.&#160; She was so cute with the bows in her hair &amp; the determined look&#160;on her face.&#160; Come to find out that this mother lost her son after heart surgery when he was about&#160;8 momths&#160;old &amp; the little girl, who was born before her brothers death,&#160;names&#160;most of&#160;her stuffed animals Michael, after her deceased brother.&#160;

The mother&#160; was so happy because now she has a beautiful grandson about a year old. Isn't that a great story. I told her we would love to meet them and to bring them down to the center.&#160; I think they might come down this week.</span>&#160; </span>Well they did.&#160; They will give their testimony&#160;at the '40 Days for Life' Victory Rally on Sunday at 2pm at Focus.&#160;

When I arrived at the center Martha, Tony, &amp; his wife Joy were there.&#160; Martha made coffee &amp; then Carole came in. I then received a phone call &amp; it was on of our moms who chose life needing me to pick her up at her new apartment to take her to the shelter for the last time before she moves into her new studio apartment.&#160; So I went to pick her up to take her to the shelter.&#160; She is now about 12 weeks pregnant &amp; things are looking up for her since she had the RU 486 pills taken out, about 4 weeks ago.&#160; When I picked her up she asked for me to stop at the corner store for a hot dog.&#160; They didn't have hot dogs but she came out with a piece of pizza instead.&#160; She was grateful that I had picked her up to take her to the shelter, for it was a cold day &amp; she hadn't worn her jacket. As I dropped her off I said to her that if she needed anything please just call me.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; said "good bye".&#160; Before I went back to the center I stopped at Wendy's to get a hamburger for lunch.&#160; When I got back to the center I stayed to eat my hamburger &amp; talk to Suzanne, our Thursday counselor, about some things.&#160; She was busy with a client in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I did a couple of things &amp; waited until she was finished &amp; sat down to talk to her about some upcoming events.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; it was a young girl needing a pregnancy test &amp; some children clothes.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again &amp; it was my friend Sue who was dropping off some diapers.&#160; She asked me how I was doing &amp; I said that I was in pain &amp; she prayed for me to God to heal me, she did that right in the hallway.&#160;

She refused the stroller because it wasn't pink.&#160; Oh well it was 'free'.&#160; I love our moms but they can be picky at times even when the items are free.&#160; I don't think that her little girl would mind to sit in a dark blue stroller.&#160;

it was a painful experience for me.&#160; They are non practicing Catholics &amp; were so mixed up about so many things &amp; their Faith.&#160; I had said to them "you're mothers are pro life".&#160; And the one young man said "my mother is pro choice".&#160; I then said then you have some brothers or sisters in Heaven.&#160; This statement upset him &amp; he called his mother on his cell phone.&#160; She said&#160;that it was between her &amp; her God.&#160; The other guy mentioned that yellow was blue if he wanted it to be.&#160;He was treating God as a magician, it was soooo sad &amp; disturbing that's for sure.&#160; The Death Escort, Barry Swan was leaning the Planned Parenthood where he commits sin &amp; he made a turn &amp; came to approach the two naive boys were protesting but didn't really know what they were doing.&#160; I was trying to cross the street to approach the situation when the Death Escort left.&#160; The poor guys said&#160; that the baby in the womb wasn't a baby, then what was it??&#160; I told then that the baby's heart is beating at 18 to 21 days, after conception,&#160;in the womb &amp; that they were once in the womb &amp; they're human.&#160; How do you explain that??&#160; They were so messed up &amp; it was so sad.&#160;I heard them talking that they were planning to have more people come to join them next time.&#160; I said "bring them on", the more the better because hopefully someone will be converted that the Lord will use us to help someone.&#160; Then they question God, I said that if you don't believe in God then ask him to relieve himself to you.&#160; The one guy called his mother again asking her more questions.&#160; They said that they were 'free thinkers', how dangerous.&#160; I said that you need guidance to direct you for you will go astray, which you are doing.&#160; I asked them if they were going to Mass every Sunday &amp; they said "no".&#160; I said that not going to Mass on Sundays is a mortal sin &amp; if you died right now you will go to Hell because you know that to be true.&#160;

There were only about 20 of us but we marched up and down the sidewalk and at one point said the Rosary together.&#160; We never saw Dr. Phelps but we made our presence known to those who went to the talk and when they exited after 8 PM.&#160; Off and on a car would drive by honking its horn in favor of us.&#160; However, one woman whom we assume attended the meeting told us she adopted children but did believe in abortion, adding that she works in a poor school and sees the bad side of what children go through and should not have to.&#160; That was the basis for her belief.&#160; She told us to adopt children so they can be spared miserable, unproductive lives but no one will because they're black.&#160; One of our protesters, a mother of 7, said she would adopt.<br />
&#160;<br />
Later, a young college-age looking woman who attended the talk approached us and in a friendly manner said she understood our protest but she believed in a woman's right to govern her own body.&#160; She said Dr. Phelps spoke on teen pregnancy and the effect of our culture on sexuality through the media, etc.&#160; Several of us tried to talk to her but she was quite glib although not verbally combative.&#160; One of the protesters loudly kept saying things to her, such as babies being killed, etc. and it was difficult for us to listen to her while he was talking.&#160; I told him to let her finish.&#160; She thanked me for that.&#160; It probably could have could have been a productive discussion with her, in my opinion, but the guy who was bizarre prevented that.&#160; At one point she said she was a Christian and I countered with killing isn't Christian or to that effect.&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
Another incident took place when a car with teenagers (that's my guess) stopped their car and a girl said, and I'm paraphrasing, "It's my body" and other statements and ended with, as they drove away, "FU!" and gave us the finger.&#160; I said to our group to pray for her.&#160; She may have&#160; had an abortion or is living a disastrous life.</strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>I did contact two TV news stations and the newspaper but none of them approached us.&#160; One TV station told me they were going to cover Dr. Phelps' talk.</strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="color: #993300"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>This is a short synopsis of the article in the 'Good Health' newsaper (a very liberal, biased newspaper), November 2010.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Phelps, (the abortionist) in Rochester, is the Associate Medical Director at Planned Parenthood who has served on expert advisory committee for the National Campaign to prevent teen &amp; unplanned pregnancy &amp; the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.&#160; (Are you kidding to think that abortion is healthy for mother &amp; child).&#160; She has lectured nationally for the National Abortion (baby killing) Federation, &amp; the Medical Students for Choice.

The anointing of the sick is administered to bring spiritual and even physical strength during an illness, especially near the time of death. It is most likely one of the last sacraments one will receive. A sacrament is an outward sign established by Jesus Christ to confer inward grace. In more basic terms, it is a rite that is performed to convey God’s grace to the recipient, through the power of the Holy Spirit.

And also gave me a plenary indulgence. "An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain defined conditions through the Church’s help when, as a minister of redemption, she dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions won by Christ and the saints" (Indulgentiarum Doctrina 1).

Development video that Martha had&#160;put on.&#160; &#160;Her mother &amp; sister&#160;went into the Material Aid Room to get some things for a baby in the family.&#160; Then they joined her outside.&#160; I noticed that the two of them walked into&#160;Planned Parenthood &amp; when they had come out the mother had called over to the daughter who was waiting for them down the street&#160;saying "I have some condoms for you"!&#160; I went up to the mother &amp; said "this is not the message that you want to&#160;give your daughter"!&#160; Then she said that her daughter drinks to much &amp;&#160;lets her guard down &amp; the guys take advantage of her because she's good looking".&#160; I said that she&#160;needs to stop drinking &amp; to get her boundaries back.&#160; It sounds like rape to me.&#160; They get her drunk &amp; have their way with her without <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.elsaelsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/crying-woman-small.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="59" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

He calls me “His Little Lamb.”</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>I was conceived in January of 1936. I know my mother loved me. I lived and grew under her heart. I didn’t get to know my father. Did he ever touch Mommy’s belly and feel me move inside her?&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>I lived for four months in my little cocoon. Something happened. I stopped living. There must have been sadness that day.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>I ended up in a Mason jar in a doctor’s office. I was the perfect specimen of a 4-month gestation baby. They say I was perfect in every way – even down to my tiny fingernails. Perfect, but not alive.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>So many, many years I stayed with this doctor. He got old and sold his practice to a younger doctor. I came as part of the deal. When this second doctor, got old and died, his son sold the contents of his house to a very nice couple. They found me in the basement, way back in the cobwebs, up on a shelf. They were shocked and asked the son, “What is this?” The son said, “Oh that thing…I used to take it to school for show and tell.” The nice couple, Dennis and Mary Frances Westfall, were shocked and very touched to find me. They adopted me, and brought me home to look after me. They named me baby&#160;Douglas.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>When the new priest in town came to bless their home, they explained their unusual situation to him. They wanted very much to give me a proper burial. Fr. Joe Catanise said he’d be honored to do this and the funeral plans were set into motion. First, I needed to be visited by the Sheriff’s Department. They wanted to know all kinds of things about where I came from. And the Coroner’s Office was quite curious, as well. My adopted parents were reluctant to part with me, they had come to love me so much, but they entrusted me to Fr. Joe’s good care, and I stayed a short while with him at St. Leo Church. Then I traveled to the Burger Funeral Home in town where I stayed until the day of the funeral. Mr. Burger was very gentle with me.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Two very nice ladies from St. Leo’s who are in charge of Pledge for Life, Patty Buskey and Anna Summa, made all the arrangements for my funeral to be open to the public as a way of offering closure to those who lost a child to miscarriage or abortion. Anna got me a pretty blanket to be wrapped in. It’s very soft and cuddly.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>The day of my funeral, June 5, 2010, some 74 years after I was conceived, was very special to many people…and to me. Nobody that attended my funeral really knew me. But there were 116 people who came to say good-bye to me. To pray for me and for all babies lost to miscarriage or abortion.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Fr. Joe knew early on whom the perfect priest would be to give the homily at my funeral. Fr. Anthony Mugavero, from Holy Apostles Church in Rochester, came to speak on my behalf – to help all people who had lost someone to miscarriage or abortion, to help heal their wounds. Some never had the chance to remember their lost child in a Mass. So my funeral Mass was really also for all of them. It was called a Mass for the Unborn. Anna and Patty advertised my funeral and invited all those who had lost a child in this way. It was an opportunity for them to find closure.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>My funeral Mass began with pretty flowers at the altar, and I was in a simple, but beautiful little white casket. I was wrapped snugly in my soft little blanket. I was right up front. And there were two soldiers in fancy hats and capes and carrying swords, as a sort of honor guard for me. They were called Knights of Columbus. It made me feel very special.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>The music was so moving. The St. Leo Resurrection Choir sang beautifully and led everyone in the hymns chosen just for me. I waited so long for this. To think that the Music Director, Patty Gorman, who had lost a baby many years ago, played so lovingly for me. It must have been very sad for her. She sounded like an angel.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Mr. Burger printed up prayer cards for me and he and Fr. Joe were of the same mind; they gave me my middle name – Leo. It’s perfect - Douglas Leo, as in St. Leo the Great, who was a very brave saint.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Fr. Mugavero spoke so beautifully about love, and that every child is a gift of God. How life is so precious, whether born or unborn. His words were so gentle and kind. He sang the words from a song by a singer named John Denver. “I want to live, I want to grow, I want to see, and I want to know, I want to share what I could give, I want to be, I want to live….” That says everything I would want to say. What could I have become if my life was allowed to develop?&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>But my coming to being, however short that time was, had a purpose - if for no other reason but to be found and be loved enough to be honored by this funeral. My existence was to help those, who have lost their dear babies, to have closure. I’m proud of that.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>The folks from Burger Funeral Home found a perfect place for me to rest in the Parma Union Cemetery. The good people who are in charge of the cemetery donated my special place. It’s next to a little girl who was born one year after I was conceived. She lived for six days. I think we will be good friends. I overheard someone at my new home say this funeral helped her have closure for a child she lost. I’m happy for that.&#160;</strong></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 11pt"><strong>Every life, no matter how well lived, matters to our God. He never forgets His creations. He had a purpose for my life, as short as it was. If I have helped one person by my short existence, I have not lived in vain. God bless all the babies.

He then said, in such a&#160;rude tone of voice, "mind your own business" &amp; he said it several times, as I was walking up the stairs, to the Church where Father was celebrating Mass.&#160; I thought later that it was my business to&#160;speak Truth to him no matter if he liked it or not.&#160; One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is Holy Boldness, just trust in the Lord for it.&#160; We must correct in love that's a Corporal Work of Mercy.&#160; We are responsible to correct those who are misguided for their repentance &amp;

said to Alan that one of the drivers just came in &amp; ripped the antenna&#160;right out of the ceiling.&#160; He said "what"!&#160; Then he said that he was going to call the bosses right&#160;away, which he did, because when I went&#160;to the outside door I saw that they were out there, in the parking lot,&#160;&amp; the driver who had just stolen the antenna was arguing with them.&#160; Unfortunately a little while later they had brought him back into the building &amp; that's when the troubles just got started with me.&#160; One of the bosses had asked me what had happened when the guy was right next to him.&#160; I started to tell him what has just happened when the 'bad guy' said to me "mind your own business" with an evil eye pointed right to me.&#160;

They&#160; wounded me a second time with their not understanding of&#160;what had just taken place &amp; their&#160;unbelief of what he had said to me.&#160; The one police officer made some really&#160;strange comments that were unbelievable &amp;&#160;quite inappropriate,&#160;to say the least.&#160; I thought that I was in the 'Twilight Zone' (for those of you that know what I'm talking about)!!&#160;&#160; It was the second nightmare of the day.&#160; Martha went around sprinkling some Holy Salt around the rooms, for what was happening was demonic, to say the least.&#160; Martha spoke to the one police officer to set him straight &amp; I was left with the other, poor me.&#160; Well I got no where fast &amp; they finally left.&#160; I decided not to make a citizens arrest for Martha didn't have in her hearing aid so she didn't hear him say that to me.&#160; That was far, if she didn't then she didn't but I did.&#160; So it was his word against my word, &amp; that's that.&#160; He latter apologized for what he said to me with the prompting of Martha who said that we should all just get along.&#160; Blessed are the peace makers.&#160; So he started to approach me &amp; I backed off &amp; accepted his apology from a far.&#160; That'll do.&#160; To say the least it was a very stressful time that was most unexpected, in the center.&#160;

Her 2 boys were in the Meeting Room playing &amp; Donna was holding little wiggly, Hannah.&#160; This&#160;'Blood Money'&#160;was heart retching, to listen to,&#160;to say the least.&#160; Just then, our sweet volunteer burst out in uncontrollable tears &amp; told us her <a id="thumbnail" href="http://rebelyogi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/crying_woman1.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px;

When she was 12 years old she was rapped.&#160; She didn't know that she was pregnant until she was 8 months along.&#160; Her mother then drove her to a place on Lattimore, next to Strong Hospital, &amp; made her have an abortion.&#160; The mother paid lots of money for the abortion.</strong></font><font size="4"><strong>&#160;When she woke up she asked about her baby, not really knowing what &#160;had&#160;just&#160;happened.&#160;When she found out&#160;that she&#160;wasn't pregnant anymore she said that she hated her mother from that moment on.&#160; When her mother, on her death bed, asked her to forgive her for what she did, she replied "no, I only hope that my baby, that you killed, will forgive you".&#160; She was crying like a baby.&#160; I got up &amp; gave her a hug &amp; a Kleenex.&#160; My heart went out to her for the loss, of her baby,&#160;&amp; for the betrayal, of her own mother.&#160; She said that her own mother wanted to abort her but was talked out of it &amp; that her grandmother raised her, for most of her life.&#160; What loss, pain &amp; rejection.&#160; My heart went out to her, for I related.&#160; Then she said that she had some children &amp; then had her Fallopian tubes tied.&#160; A couple of years later she thought that she could be pregnant so she went to Strong Hospital to get&#160;a pregnancy test.&#160; It was positive.&#160; The female doctor told her that she had an infection &amp; that she needed to take 'this pill'.&#160; She told her that she would when se got home.&#160;The doctor said "no, you need to take it now".&#160; So she did &amp; off she went home thinking that she had an infection &amp; all will be well.&#160; No so, not so.&#160; The next day she started to bleed &amp; all 'this stuff' came out of me, she said.&#160; Then she new that she was pregnant &amp; that the doctor had given her an abortion pill.&#160; She was devastated to say the least &amp; heart broken again.&#160; She didn't believe in abortion &amp; never wanted one.&#160; <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.paolocaesar.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/deception.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

two doctors.&#160; I spoke with her for awhile &amp; then we continued to watch the intense DVD.&#160; After it was over I realized how important&#160;it was, for it had triggered, our sweet volunteer &amp; myself, from past traumas.&#160; Martha &amp; Donna were&#160;also effected by this video.&#160;&#160;A must see for all pro lifers.&#160; I thought of showing it at&#160;Focus, during the '40 Days for Life' campaign.&#160;&#160;The DVD is short 2 hours, it goes quickly, but it's soooo important&#160;to watch!!&#160;

After her abortion she started to cry &amp; the so called nurse at Planned Parenthood said "maybe this wasn't the right decision for you after all".&#160; Now what then, the damage is already done??&#160; Rachael Phelps just killed her precious baby &amp; the so called nurse said "oh, I think you made a mistake prehaps".&#160; What about before the fact dearie &amp; why does Planned Parenthood kill children anyway??&#160; Well the&#160;shocker was, after she was told today that she was pregnant, the so called nurse said to her "why don't you come back tomorrow to terminate".&#160; The poor girl almost vomited on the floor, so out of the Killing Mill she goes, all alone, until she sees the sidewalk counselor who now changes her life.&#160;

gets a whole lot of things for her children &amp; the sidewalk counselor brings her home.&#160; How can anyone NOT believe in God??&#160; I was said that she told Pat that when she went for the abortion there was no one there in front of Planned Parenthood so in she went to do the awful deed &amp; when she came out in the early afternoon there we were, on the front lines.&#160; She said that she saw our graphic sign of the 10 week old aborted baby &amp; she knew that was her baby, that she just paid the abortionist Rachael Phelps to murder, in cold blood.&#160;

healing, from God &amp; her precious baby, that was killed that awful abortion day.&#160; My heart is very sad that we can't get anyone to be out in front of Planned Parenthood on Tuesday &amp; Thursday mornings.&#160; I will say that Pat &amp; Bill do pray, the Rosary, for an hour on Tuesday mornings, so it seemed that this woman came after they left, to have the abortion.&#160; We should have pro lifers there, in front of Planned Parenthood, every day &amp; all day long too.&#160; What's wrong with this picture?&#160; Why are good people so docile when it comes to abortion, which effects us all, in this country?&#160;&#160;Abortion is&#160;the murdering of an innocent&#160;human being, that is totally dependent on the mother, in the womb, where it should be safe. &#160;This cancer, of abortion,&#160;has hit home to all of us, either directly or indirectly.&#160;

I went on &amp; on, for it's so horrible to see someone that you know that kills children &amp; acts like it's no big deal.&#160; What's wrong with her?&#160; Why is she killing children?&#160; Earlier this afternoon a car <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/PEM1257.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

"Where is yours Mary" said Donna.&#160; I said that I was very busy in the center so go into the office to see what a mess it is.&#160; "No excuse, you need to go vote tonight".&#160; Then here comes Anne, who says <a id="thumbnail" href="http://ccofal.org/alabama/images/VOTING.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="106" height="79" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

joined us, then a client came in to get some things in the Material Aid Room. I said good bye to Kathy &amp; then went to assist our client in the&#160;clothing room.&#160; &#160;After she went out of the center I said to Martha "please go to see if the abortionist is here today".&#160; She went outside with the signs &amp; the literature box &amp; the mega phone to go into battle.&#160; I asked her if it was okay with her I'd like to work in the office to catch up on some things &amp; then I'll come right out to be with her on the front lines.&#160; She agreed that was okay.&#160; So I stayed in the center while Martha was outside, by herself, which we don't like to do.&#160; I did a couple of things in the office to play 'catch up' &amp; then went outside to be with Martha.&#160; I looked in the parking lot &amp; I didn't see the abortionist there, so I said "Martha, the abortionist isn't here"!&#160; Just then the abortionist, Rachael Phelps drives out of the parking lot.&#160; I hollered to her to stop killing little babies &amp; to repent.&#160; She just drove off&#160;acting like nothing she's doing is wrong.&#160; Oh Lord help&#160;us!!&#160; </font></strong></p></div></div></div><div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">A car with two women &amp;

I finally told her that her pregnancy test was negative after she asked me what the results were, for I had looked at the results but failed to tell her, until she asked.&#160;&#160;She was in a hurry &amp;

She said that she was with her friend &amp; that she needed diapers &amp; wipes for her 2 year old twins, a boy&#160;&amp; a girl.&#160; I went into the office, where we have the supply of diapers, under the literature tables.&#160; I found a couple of bags to give to the moms along with some baby wipes.&#160; They were both very happy.&#160; They picked out some nice things in the Material Aid Room for their children.&#160; I was ready to be with Martha, on the front lines, when the doorbell rang again.&#160; There at the door was&#160; a young woman, &amp;&#160;a cute little boy &amp; an older man with long hair &amp; a beard.&#160; "May I help you" I asked.&#160; "Yes, I need some clothes&#160;&amp; diapers for&#160;my son".&#160; "Come on in" I said &amp; I lead them into the Material Aid Room for some shopping.&#160; It turned out that she was a referral client.&#160; She needed more assistance than we could give her but we had lots of referrals for her to call regarding 'Food Pantries' &amp; free furniture, for her apartment, etc..&#160; I said all you have to do is make some phone calls &amp; here is a referral from the Focus Center, in case any organization needs one, then you'll have&#160;this to give to them to receive their assistance.&#160; She &amp; her father were very happy, to say the least.&#160; I was happy to be able to help this nice mom &amp; her son.&#160; God bless this family.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">I went out to the front lines where Martha was by herself, saying her Rosary, God love her.&#160;

I'm hungry &amp; ready to faint".&#160; She said "okay" &amp; we gathered everything on the sidewalk to take with us back to the center.&#160; I stayed while Martha was putting thing away &amp; out come a car, from the Planned Parenthood, parking lot.&#160; I called over to her &amp; offered her a Truth packet.&#160; She said that she didn't believe in abortions &amp; said that Planned Parenthood does.&#160; She took the packet &amp; smiled at me &amp; said "thank you".&#160; "No" I said "thank you".&#160; As I was finished with this open minded woman of faith another car drove into the parking lot with a Rosary on her mirror.&#160; When she got out of the car &amp; lit into her about the hypocrisy of having a Rosary on&#160;her car mirror &amp; going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; When she drove out, about a few minutes later, for she went into the Administration Building entrance, she saw the graphic picture of Malachi &amp; I said that they kill children here every day.&#160; I saw that her face was effected, when she went&#160;face to&#160;face, with this aborted baby.&#160; I felt that she had a heart &amp; I pray that she'll never come back here&#160;again, through the grace of God.&#160;

I said to him to get out of the driveway, where do you think that you're going?&#160; I new that she was pregnant because I showed her a&#160;rubberized baby at 12 weeks &amp; she said quickly "is that what my baby looks like".&#160; Oh yea, he or she does.&#160; Through the grace&#160;of God it&#160;took me about 10 minutes to convince them to follow me into the Focus Center where Suzanne awaited to&#160;counsel them or anyone else I brought in to her.&#160;

said something to me but they were to far away tfor me to hear what the one girl was saying.&#160; They both went into Planned Parenthood &amp; were there for awhile.&#160; When they came back out the one girl, who was the passenger, said something to me &amp; again&#160;I was to far away to hear what she was saying.&#160; I was now by myself for Bill had to go.&#160;The car was coming out of the parking lot&#160;&amp; it&#160;stopped &amp; the young girl, who was the passenger said to me,&#160;"why are you hear? &#160;I'm a Christian so shut your blank, blank, mouth".&#160; I said "no, you're not Christian maybe a pretend one but not a real one for&#160;a real Christian&#160;wouldn't speak that way".&#160; Just then my cell phone rang &amp; I said to her "just a minute I have to get this".&#160; Believe it or not they waited&#160;until I got off the phone&#160;&amp; then she continued to say "why don't you leave these girls alone you blank, blank".&#160; I then said to her "your tongue is going to fall out, you need your mouth cleaned up".&#160; Off they went into the sunset, only kidding but they finally did leave &amp; went up the street towards E. Main St..&#160; 'The End', so I thought but I was wrong.&#160; About a half hour later a&#160;car was coming very close to where I was standing on the sidewalk &amp; I said "be careful, you're to close".

I called the center to ask if Suzanne could ring me put a bottle of water, not to throw at anyone, but to cleanse my right eye out.&#160; She did &amp; I then splashed&#160;it on my right eye, to rinse it out.&#160; You should have seen the guy in the parking lot of the business right next door, the look on his face was priceless.&#160; I wonder what he thought I was doing with the water.&#160; He'll never know.&#160; Thanks Suzanne for saving the day!!</font></strong></p><div><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">I looked down the street &amp; I saw an elderly man walking up the street with a large can in his hands, it looked like a paint can hut as he drew closer to me I <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/murphye/map%20project/old-man-laughing.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 92px; float: left; height: 68px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:DtvkjjvqYNewaM:http://www.stolaf.edu/people/murphye/map%20project/old-man-laughing.jpg" /></a>saw that it up an open can that was empty.&#160; I looked the other way briefly &amp; when I turned back I saw that he was seated on the wooden ledge that surrounds Planned Parenthood's bushes. He mumbled a comment, about the graphic picture of the aborted baby, who was massacred by abortion, that was straight from Hell &amp; for the first time ever, out on the front lines, I said for him to "shut up".&#160; I had the crucifix &amp; earlier I had said the Hail Mary prayer &amp; the St. Michael the Archangel prayer, against the Evil One, now I was praying in tongues.&#160; All of a sudden he is using a demonic voice &amp; in a different <img alt="See full size image" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 84px; float: left; height: 60px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:8icCa4Tx6NWdaM:http://freethoughts.org/archives/police.jpg" />language.&#160; It was straight from the Exorcist movie.&#160; I said "you have two seconds to leave before I call the police".&#160; He immediately stood&#160;up &amp; walked up the street to where ever.&#160; This was another spittle attack against life, three times in less then 2 hours.&#160; Thank you Lord Jesus for protecting me against the attacks from the Evil One.<br /><br />
Since I had Suzanne on the sidewalk &amp; a few minutes later Elaine came to bring the chairs to the center I asked them both since it was around 4pm to help me carry the signs &amp; literature box into the center, which they did. So God sent me 2 people to help me.&#160; I was now in the center &amp; Rose was helping another mother out in the Material Aid Room.&#160; We served 6 moms on Tuesday &amp; Wednesday &amp; today, Thursday many more.&#160; I was settling in when the doorbell rang.&#160; I went to the door to see three young girls at the door.&#160; I opened the door &amp; asked if I cold help them.&#160; The one girl said "I'd like a <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.watercolorsbymarian.com/Sold/StoneMtn3Girls.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="57" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:LAiw5Q6n6Nx7lM:http://www.watercolorsbymarian.com/Sold/StoneMtn3Girls.jpg" /></a>pregnancy test, then the other girl said "I want a pregnancy test" &amp; the other girl said "I need one too".&#160; I invited them into the center &amp; asked "how are you all related"?&#160; The one girl said "we're all sisters". Something is wrong with this family dynamics.&#160; I was glad that they came to the Focus Center where they will be safe &amp; so will their children be too, if they are pregnant.&#160; I brought them into the Rose Room &amp; because there were three girls I asked them to fill out their own Intake Sheet.&#160; I spoke with the girls &amp; hem started to do the pregnancy tests.&#160; The one sister was pregnant.&#160; She was 15 years old &amp; said that she's been dating her boyfriend for 5 years.&#160; What!!&#160; She's been dating him since she was 10 years old. Where was her parents??&#160; She was open for life &amp; so where her 2 sisters for they were excited in being Aunts &amp; had already named the baby after them.&#160; I spoke to the other two girls about abstinence.&#160; The one girl said that she was going to now save herself for her husband.&#160; The other sister hopefully will follow suit.&#160; I said to them not to try to get pregnant because your sister is expecting just enjoy being Aunts.&#160; They agreed. The one girl was hungry so I went &amp; got each of them a snack &amp;&#160;a&#160;bottle of water. They all took a Truth packet &amp; I gave them the Growth &amp; Development DVD &amp; the 12 week of rubberized baby to take with them to witness to others.&#160; I asked them to keep away from Planned Parenthood &amp; they said that they were just over there today, probably just after I left to come into the center, &amp; they told them <a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.forparentsbyparents.com/images/pregnancy_diary/anita_baby_2_1007.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="107" height="79" style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:LKN5nIdS0U0CIM:http://www.forparentsbyparents.com/images/pregnancy_diary/anita_baby_2_1007.jpg" /></a>that unless they were willing to terminate they wouldn't do a pregnancy test so they saw our sign on the sidewalk &amp; came to Focus for assistance.&#160; Which I'm glad that they did, thank God.&#160; I asked what their parents would say about this news &amp; the pregnant girl said that she will be all right with it &amp; so will her boyfriend.&#160; I said to her&#160;don't let anyone talk&#160;you into an abortion &amp; she said that she wouldn't let anyone talk her into it.&#160; This was good news.&#160; I said for them to call me if they needed any assistance, for I'm only a phone call away.&#160; I showed them the Material Aid Room &amp; said for her to come back to get some nice things for her baby when she finds out if her baby is a girl or boy.&#160; She said "thank you &amp; I will".&#160; I gave them Compass Care's phone number for an ultrasound &amp; for STD testing which the other girls were inquiring about.&#160; I hope that today their lives will change for the better &amp; to make good choices for themselves, from now on.&#160; A 'new life' was left alone&#160;to grow &amp; be born, next year.&#160; Yeah!! These girls were young &amp; I hope &amp; pray like all our girls that their parents will do better in showing good example &amp; to teach their children better &amp; how to respect their bodies &amp;

Well plans change quickly for as I was driving, not good, I got a call &amp; it was a client saying that she was at the center right now.&#160; I told her to wait &amp; that I'd be there in 5 minutes.&#160; When I arrived at the center I saw two girls waiting for me.&#160; I let them in, one of the girls is our client, she brought in her friend for a pregnancy test.&#160; As I was doing the test, she who is due in January, was freely shopping in our Material Aid Room, having a ball.&#160; The pregnancy test &amp; teaching was completed, then our newest client went into the Material Aid Room, to do some shopping for her 2 year daughter.&#160; They both left very happy.&#160; I asked our&#160;client to get me some brochures from Healthy Moms program, next to St. Mary's &amp;

didn't have a chance to get out on the front line until about 1:30pm, which broke my heart.&#160; Being on the front lines is a matter of life &amp; death, for the little ones.&#160; It was frustrating, but we had several moms come in to receive baby &amp; children clothes &amp; diapers, which was important.&#160; Sandy was there to help them for Rose didn't show up today, hope she is okay.&#160; Donna called in sick, so she wasn't going to be there today on the front lines, &amp; Mary S. is celebrating her 25th. Wedding Anniversary &amp; is in California for 2 weeks.&#160; So it was just Martha &amp; I out on the front lines.&#160; Jerry showed up much later, to pray.&#160; Rick the '40 Days for Life' Coordinator came &amp; around 1:10pm to start to set up for the rally at 5:30pm.&#160; I was doing so many things that my head began to spin.&#160; Well, Martha &amp; I finally went out on the front lines.&#160; I saw that the abortionist Rachael Phelps wasn't there but there could have been another abortionist there to take her place.&#160; You just have to treat everyone like they were here for an abortion so as not to miss anyone, until you're told differently by the person.&#160; Well that happened.&#160; A car came out &amp; stopped along side of us.&#160;&#160;I popped my head&#160;near the car &amp; began to witness what Planned Parenthood&#160;does in there.&#160; They listened to both Martha &amp; I.&#160; I gave them a Truth packet &amp; a DVD on Black Genocide,&#160; The young girl &amp; guy were all so nice &amp; asked for a&#160;doctors name.&#160; I went over to the literature box &amp; got out our small list of pro life doctors to give to her.&#160; She looked at it &amp; said that 2 of the doctors would work.&#160; Yeah!&#160; They&#160;said "thank you"&#160;&amp; then went into the vets parking lot to turn around.&#160;&#160;We waved at them as they passed by us &amp; they waved back to Martha &amp; I.&#160; &#160;They were open to the Truth, thank God, so now they have a 'New Beginning', through the grace of God.&#160;

We've had trouble with guys on skate boards before.&#160; They have spit on our signs &amp; crashed into them &amp; were nasty as they rode by us, so I was ready with my&#160;cell phone for anything.&#160; They disappeared&#160;as they were crossing Gibbs St. pass our strip mall were we have our pregnancy center.&#160;&#160;Bye boys just grow up &amp; keep your nasty mouths closed.&#160; No respect for 'life' which they enjoy.&#160; Well I was wrong.&#160; It was about 20 minutes later that one of the&#160;boys came passed Martha &amp; I on his skate board mouthing off, right in front of us.&#160; &#160;I wasn't going to mess around so I pretended to call the police right in front of him.&#160; He quickly went down Wayland St. &amp; disappeared, hopefully never for us to see him again, until he repents.&#160; I love this scare method for it usually works.&#160; Only 2 times in all my years it didn't work the abusers just stayed there until&#160;I could think up another way to get rid of them harassing us.&#160;

She's there about less than 5 minutes &amp; come out talking to the death escort&#160;Barry Swan.&#160; I spoke to her again &amp; she gunned her&#160;motor to drown me out, I mean the Truth.&#160; As she passed by me I told her to&#160;"repent".&#160;

She later went home to take a shower &amp; to put on lighter clothes because it was so very hot.&#160; Mind you I'm not complaining for I'd rather be&#160;hot that cold.&#160; Burr...&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I did take off my sweater but I had a turtle neck underneath.&#160;

Then he said&#160;"Mary I'm going to call Fr. O'Malley to have him do an exorcist".&#160; I called back to him saying "please get some new material, while trying to insult me, this is old stuff".&#160; Just&#160;before this happened, my sweet friend Donna arrived, with her darling daughter Hannah who is 14 months old.&#160; She&#160;didn't like what she heard him say to me so she decided to walk across the street &amp; speak to him.&#160; When she came back about 10 minutes later,&#160;all she said was, "Mary we'll have to pray for him".&#160; I guess he was in the war &amp;&#160;is confused to what we're all about in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; He&#160;said that he was a Christian.&#160;All I&#160;can say is that some one has failed him in his Church.&#160; After Donna left&#160;I went across the street to see Jerry, who was on his knees praying, holding a crucifix, praying to end abortion.&#160;&#160;Then I heard Jim say "Mary now what are you doing"?&#160; I just stayed there &amp; prayed.&#160; I&#160;did say&#160;"God will take care of you".&#160; He quivered at that statement.&#160; All I mean is that God&#160;doesn't want you to persecute your brother or sister in the Lord &amp; He loves those who He disciplines.&#160; It wasn't a curse or anything like that.&#160; We are all responsible with what we say &amp; do &amp; not do, including myself.&#160; I have to forgive him, for that's what it is in being a Christian.&#160;</span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><div><span style="font-size: medium">A skuffy older man came walking up the street &amp; he stopped to tell me that when he was 21 years old, his 17 year old girlfriend got pregnant, &amp; she wanted an abortion.&#160; He talked her out of it &amp; his daughter is 37 years old now.&#160; Thank God for him talking action in saving his daughter's life.&#160;This is great news!!&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><div><span style="font-size: small">I was standing on the sidewalk when I saw that a young woman had just come out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I hollered over to her offering her the Truth packet.&#160; She walked over to me, with no expression on her face &amp; I smiled at her &amp; gave her the packet without saying a word, I asked her no questions, which was very unusual for me.&#160; Nothing came out of my mouth. I later regretted that I had asked her no questions but I have to believe that the Holy Spirit was in charge &amp; not me.&#160; After she took the packet she walked back over to the other side of the sidewalk, then walked up the street probably to catch a bus.&#160; I was just so happy that she took the packet.&#160; Well, she has been in my life ever since.&#160; More to come on tomorrow's Front Line Weekly.&#160; I left the sidewalk to get ready for the Board Meeting &amp; the Kick Off Rally, for the '40 Days for Life'&#160;in our new Great Room at Focus!!&#160; </span></div></span></div><h3>&#160;<span style="color: #3366ff"><span style="font-size: medium">At the Board Meeting&#160;we voted our newest member to the Board tonight.&#160;&#160;Rob is&#160;our longest acting male sidewalk counselor, in front of Planned Parenthood.

She said "I don't want it".&#160; Martha talked to her mostly for I was still in shock, for she was the girl that I handed the truth packet to yesterday afternoon &amp; didn't say anything to her or ask her any questions, before going into the center for the Board Meeting &amp;&#160;the Rally.&#160;I wasn't in a hurry when she approached me yesterday I just saw that her face &amp; thought that I was glad that she came over to me to accept the packet.&#160; She then said that she had put the RU 486 inside her.&#160; I asked if I could show her a picture of what her baby looks like at 7 weeks &amp; to follow me into the pregnancy center, which she did.&#160; I brought her into the Rose Room &amp; talked to her asking if I could call the doctor &amp; to take her to the doctor for him to remove the pills.&#160;

My heart had dropped to my ankles.&#160; As she left I asked her again to call the doctor &amp; she said "maybe I will, I don't know yet".&#160; I was a little hopeful for the first time.&#160; As she was walking down the street I just hollered to her "we love you", "we love you", "we love you".&#160;&#160;

her precious, innocent baby.&#160; They did.&#160; The rest of the day was very difficult for I had no way to reach her.&#160; I didn't ask for her to fill out an Intake Sheet because &amp; I didn't want her to get up &amp; leave.&#160; She, if she needed me to reach me anytime, that she knew.&#160; So it was up to her to contact me or not.&#160; Talk about suffering, for the Lord.&#160; If&#160;the Lord&#160;needed this kind of suffering then so be it to save the lives of both mother &amp;

she went with her to the Dollar General on Main St., she was glad of that&#160;for she doesn't live in Rochester but she said that she had a good sense of direction.&#160; Better you than me, that's for sure.&#160; They came back&#160;about 20 minutes later with 8 cartons of plastic bags.&#160; Thanks so very much Helen.&#160; The girls kept on going, going &amp; going some more.&#160; No one came in to the Material Aid Room for clothes until after they left.&#160;&#160;Maybe next week&#160;girls, for the experience.&#160;

I recognized her immediately &amp; she approached us.&#160; All this happened so fast my head was spinning.&#160; She said to me that Planned Parenthood won't give her anesthesia for the abortion so she wanted the pills to be taken out.&#160; Oh my God it's happening!!&#160; I quickly brought her to the center where Suzanne, our&#160;Thursday counselor&#160;was, &amp; asked her to call the doctor to tell him that we were on our way.&#160; Our regular doctor was out of town though so we called our other referral doctor.&#160; He said to bring her right over.&#160; I asked Martha to come with me for my legs were like jelly.&#160; She told the other people, that were on the sidewalk praying, that she was&#160;leaving &amp; for them to take over &amp; off we went to the doctors office who is off of Genesee St..&#160; The&#160;traffic was horrible, poor Martha was stopping at every light it seemed &amp; there was road work ahead of us.&#160; At one point the young lady said that she wanted to go home until Martha told her that women&#160;can die from these&#160;pills.&#160; She said "how".&#160; I quickly told her that they&#160;bleed to death.&#160; She changed her mind about going home &amp; we were at the doctors office&#160;about 10 minutes later.&#160; We all got out of the car &amp; went into the office where they took her to the back room to wait for the doctor, who was there ready to 'save a life'.&#160; Martha &amp; I waited in the waiting room until I couldn't stand the stress any longer &amp; decided to go for a walk down Warwick Ave. which is right next to the doctors office.&#160; I wanted to see the house where I lived when I was 6 years old&#160;when I was in second grade at St. Augustine's Catholic Church, which is now closed.&#160; I made my First Holy Communion at that church.&#160; I walked gingerly down the street looking at every house to find the one that I lived in.&#160; I saw an elderly Black woman sweeping her driveway &amp; decided to stop to talk to her.&#160; This encounter was such a joy to my heart.&#160; A wise &amp; wonderful woman she was.&#160; I told her that I once lived on this street about 54 years ago.&#160; She said that she didn't live there then&#160;even though she has been there for many years.&#160; She said that she lost her husband about 7 years ago &amp; once worked at Strong in the Labor Room helping to deliver babies.&#160; I asked if she assisted with abortions &amp; she said "no baby, I wouldn't have done that".&#160; Don't you love her.&#160; Her next door neighbor came out &amp; joined us.&#160; I spoke with her for a few minutes &amp; asked her to take care of Gwen, that was her name, &amp; she said that she does.&#160; I smiled &amp; was happy to hear this.&#160; I said "good bye &amp; God bless" &amp; continued to walk down the street to find the house.&#160; I did.&#160; I just stood there looking up at the window that was once&#160;my bedroom.&#160; It was a duplex &amp; we lived upstairs.&#160; I just keep on looking &amp; the people who were sitting on their porch next door started to look at me.&#160; I said to them that I used to live in this house when I was 6 years old &amp;&#160;I asked them&#160;some questions &amp; they answered me.&#160; I was afraid to leave Martha in the doctors office by herself for very long so I looked at the neighbors &amp; said "what happened in this house shouldn't have happened to any child", for&#160;I&#160;was molested, by my father, in that house.&#160; I walked back to the doctors to be with Martha.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">We waited for the procedure of the pills to be taken out for about 45 minutes &amp; we were talking to the patients that were waiting for the doctor not knowing what was going on, for he took our girl right away.&#160; He came out of the examining room &amp; I spoke with him &amp; he said to pray for her &amp; her baby.&#160; I said that was a given &amp; thanked him for taking her right away.&#160; He said "no problem" &amp; he walked back into the examining room.&#160; She came out about 10 minutes later.&#160; I asked her how she was doing &amp; she said that she felt better&#160;once the pills were removed.&#160; I was glad to hear his.&#160; I thanked the office people for their cooperation in this urgent matter &amp; said good bye &amp; we all left.&#160; When we got into the car our young lady said "I need a cigarette".&#160; You got to be kidding, I thought, not another way to wreck this baby.&#160; She was so&#160;stressed out that Martha &amp; I thought, that this once, it might be better to let her have one, so&#160;I bought a pack of cigarette's &amp; gave her&#160;just 1.&#160; I went into a corner store on W. Main St. &amp; asked for a pack of Newports &amp; this young person appeared.&#160; I asked him how old he was &amp; he said 15.&#160; I said that I didn't think that 15 year olds were to suppose to sell cigarette's.&#160; He said that it was okay &amp; if it wasn't he'd still do it.&#160; That's another problem for another day. &#160;(Days later I spoke to my police friend &amp; he said that it was illegal &amp; it can reported it to the Dept.of Tobacco Firearms and Alcohol) &#160;&#160;She smoked it in the car with the window down.&#160; As we were driving down Hudson Ave. the street where they shoot people all the time she asked for Martha to stop to get chicken wings.&#160; Are you kidding I thought to myself.&#160; Martha said "yes just&#160;tell me where to stop".&#160; Well she was a help!!&#160; The fun never stops!&#160; We stopped at a&#160;Chinese Take Out that had chicken wings of course.&#160; Her &amp; I got out of the car while Martha was waiting in the car.&#160; She put in an order &amp; so did I for at this time Martha &amp; I were hungry too.&#160; While she was waiting for her order to come up a little girl around 7 years old waved at her.&#160; She made a comment saying "see the little girl she just waved at me &amp; I don't even know her".&#160;&#160;The Lord was showing her the love of a child, to soften her heart for her child growing inside of her.&#160;&#160;We then took her home with the understanding for her to call us if she needed&#160;anything &amp; to call the doctor, in a couple of days,&#160;to schedule an ultrasound &amp; exam.&#160; She said that she would do it.&#160;&#160;Martha &amp; I drove back to the center to eat our Chinese chicken wings &amp; they were good.&#160; What a day as we praised God for all that He did through us, to save the life of His children, both hers &amp; her baby's.&#160; We told everyone, who were still praying, in front of Planned Parenthood,&#160;to pray some more for this situation &amp; I sent out a prayer request to&#160;my email list also.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div><div><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: #0000ff">Friday, September 24, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: small">I received a call from our new client Ms. C. &amp;

I said that I am the director of a pregnancy center.&#160; She said that she has taken in pregnant girls in her home.&#160; I was so happy to hear this &amp; I took down her name &amp; phone number, so when our new mom called saying that she needed to find a place to live temporally I though of her.&#160; I called her &amp; she said for me to come to look at the room this evening at 7pm.&#160; I called Ms. C &amp; set up a time to pick her up to take her to see the room.&#160; I picked her &amp; her girlfriend &amp; Ms.C around 6:30pm &amp; drove them over to see the house off of St. Paul Blvd..&#160; When&#160;we arrived we were greeted by Beverly &amp; she showed us the room upstairs.&#160; The room was very small but durable to the situation.&#160; Then she said that she had a male tenant down the short hall.&#160; She&#160;assured us&#160;that there would be no privacy issue but I felt uncomfortable with this surprise.&#160; I remembered that she said that there was another room downstairs so I asked to see this room.&#160; The room was off of the kitchen &amp; had a powder room next to it.&#160; It was by the back door which a porch, which was nice.&#160; Beverly had no real rules to live in her home.&#160; No curfew &amp; your own key, just clean up after yourself which was a given.&#160; This seemed like a wonderful place for our Ms. C to move into to get away from the chaos where she is now for her sake &amp; that of her baby.&#160; I &amp; she &amp; her friend were very happy.&#160; Ms. C told Beverly that she will take it &amp; asked when she could move in.&#160; Beverly said how about Sunday at 2pm, we all agreed.&#160; We thanked Beverly &amp; left.&#160; The girls were hungry so I stopped at Price Rite in a very bad neighbor because that's were is was, at least they had a policeman there walking around.&#160; Oh boy!!</span></div></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span><div><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: medium">Sunday,&#160;September 27, 2010</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Ms. C. made arrangements to move into the house that we went to on Friday.&#160;

When she drove into the parking lot&#160;I noticed that her front right head light was out.&#160; We debated what to do but figured that if she&#160;drives carefully&#160;we will be all right, until she can get it fixed the next day.&#160; We took her car because it's bigger &amp; holds more because Ms. C will be bringing all what she owns with her to the new place from her old home, otherwise we would have taken my smaller car.&#160; We then picked up Ms. C with all her heavy bags &amp; suitcases &amp; we were off to her new beginning in her life once she decided to 'chose life' &amp; had the RU 486 abortion pills taken out of her.&#160; Martha &amp; I were happy for her.&#160; Well things can change real fast in life so always be ready but always trust in God for He is in control &amp;

Ms. C was&#160;very upset to say the least &amp; called one of the shelters &amp; she couldn't get in because of a sanction that&#160;was&#160;against her plus they had no room available either.&#160;

I said "no you're not going to the park to sleep".&#160; She said "don't tell me what to do" &amp; got out of the car &amp; ran like a gazelle down the street.&#160; I hollered for her to stop for I can't run do to health issues but I did see from afar that she turned left at the corner, so I went back into the car to tell Martha so that&#160;we could pick her up.&#160; &#160;Martha was backing&#160;out of the driveway &amp; almost hit the tree behind her, she tried several times to straightened out until she told me to put my head down, which I did then she got out of the driveway safely.&#160; She drove down the street &amp; I told her to make a left &amp; then we spotted our girl &amp; stopped the car &amp; asked her to come back into the car so&#160;we can try to&#160;make arrangements&#160;for tonight.&#160;

We were surrounded &amp; the flashlights were now shinning in the car looking for whatever, which we don't do.&#160; Martha rolled down the window, to a woman police officer which meant business, which I can't blame her in that neighborhood but if you look at Martha all you see is sweetness, until she told me to shut up because I was laughing i<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.myorkutglitter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/i-m-sorry.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="80" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

registration &amp; insurance card which she did &amp; then asked her if she new why she was being stopped.&#160; Martha told her it was because of her front headlight which was out &amp; that&#160;she just found out about tonight &amp; couldn't do anything about it until tomorrow.&#160; The officer went back to her car to check out Martha &amp; then came back with a ticket &amp; told her that if she gets her car fixed tomorrow that she could send the proof in to get the ticket taken away.&#160; Sounded good to Martha who was about to scream, with all that had taken place in such a short period of time late at night, &amp; the night wasn't over with yet.&#160; After the police had left to fight crime on the streets of Rochester, which is very dangerous &amp; our prayers are with them, you could hear a pin drop in the car.&#160; I don't remember if we talked at all but I think that we did.&#160; We got to the center safe &amp; sound &amp; I got out &amp; thanked Martha for all that she did this evening &amp; to tell Ms. C that everything will work out just be patient &amp; we are hear for her at all times &amp; I said good bye &amp; left.&#160; I went into the center to do some work then went home around 12 midnight.&#160;

It's called transference.&#160; Tucker when he came tried to talk to her, so did Carole &amp; Linda, but the lady just kept on going like the,&#160;generalized bunny. &#160;The neighbor Sue Bovay came out to look to see what was going on, poor lady.&#160;

it was one of our clients who is due any day now with her mother.&#160; They came to pick up the car seat that we got for the baby.&#160; I was surprised to see them because I told them I would be there from 1-8pm but this worked out well.&#160; I invited them into the Material Aid Room to pick up some more things for her baby girl, who will soon join us in this world.&#160; Praise God, for this mom was going into Planned Parenthood about 7 months ago, to have an abortion &amp; changed her mind after I showed her the graphic sign Malachi &amp; gave her a Truth packet.&#160; I didn't know that she changed her mind until about 3 weeks ago.&#160; Thank you Lord!&#160; She is the friend of our newest client that had the RU 486 abortion pills taken out of her more than a week ago, that Martha &amp;&#160;I brought her to our doctor for the removal, &amp;

gave them some brochures to educate them.&#160; I get the feeling that the girls mom doesn't know that she went to Planned Parenthood to have an abortion that day.&#160; But the outcome is real good that she stayed pregnant &amp; will be delivering her daughter soon.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; This is what it is all about "new life' created by God to be in this world until He call us to go to the next world for all&#160;Eternity&#160;either to be with Him or to be with the Evil One.&#160;

asked for help to unload my car with baby &amp; children items that I was blessed with from the second hand store in East Rochester.&#160; After that I was suppose to go to Webster to pick up a small crib for one of our clients with a small baby girl.&#160; Well that never happened.&#160; I called our client &amp; she couldn't come until tomorrow so I decided to wait until later tonight to pick up the items so I emailed Maria about the change of plans.&#160; The Lord had another plan for this day.&#160; I was expecting Tim to come to set up the bassinet for another one of our clients &amp; to give Martha &amp; I a ham &amp; turkey sub for lunch.&#160; Both came to pass.&#160; I went out to see if the abortionist, Rachael Phelps was there &amp; she was.&#160; As I was walking back to the center &amp; approached a young girl &amp; asked if she needed any assistance.&#160; She said that she needed a pregnancy test so I asked her follow me into the center to get on, she did.&#160; I called to Martha to ask her if she would assist this young lady &amp; she said that she would.&#160; Ironically she knew her from the past.&#160; Tony &amp; Joy who are husband &amp; wife came in to talk to Martha &amp; I for a few minutes &amp; then took some graphic signs &amp; went out to the front lines while I worked at my desk for a few minutes of catch up, but not for long.&#160; The doorbell rang&#160; then Martha had stuck her head into the office to tell me that a couple with 2 children were in the Material Aid Room to get some clothes &amp; she was busy doing a pregnancy test.&#160; No problem Martha.&#160; I got up &amp; went into the Material Aid Room &amp; there was Tony &amp; a woman &amp; a man &amp; 2 young girls around 2 &amp; 3 years old, in a stroller.&#160; Then Tony said to me that she had an appointment at Planned Parenthood on Tuesday,&#160;my heart almost dropped.&#160; I turned to her &amp; asked her for what.&#160; She said to me so matter of a fact tone of voice,&#160;which ripped my flesh, to have an abortion.&#160; I looked right at her &amp; said "no you're not going to kill your baby".&#160; The man with her said something to her in Spanish, oh no, I thought.&#160;&#160;I might not understand Spanish but I certainly can read faces &amp; I didn't like what I saw in his.&#160; I spoke to them both &amp; then he said "it's not my baby".&#160; Lord have Mercy!&#160; I said that it didn't matter whose baby it was that this child was created by God, on loan to you both, to take care of, so work it out.&#160; Martha was finished with the client in the Rose Room so she brought them into the room to speak to them both.&#160; She was with them counseling them for about 15 minutes.&#160; When they came out I continued to speak to them too.&#160; They were given many brochures &amp; DVD's one was the movie Bella &amp; I showed them pictures of aborted babies to which they both reacted to.&#160; I gave them food &amp; diapers for their daughters, from the Material Aid Room &amp; told then that we would help them with their needs.&#160; Martha read to them the poem 'My Life Depends One You, which the mother reacted emotionally.&#160; Then Martha said to the man who still stated that this was not his baby by saying "have you ever made a mistake"?&#160; He bet his head &amp; then the wife said "oh yea you have two other children by another woman &amp; then he said oh yea you have a child in Peru".&#160; What a mess!&#160; Then Martha stated to them, with her hands up, "well then, you're one happy family"!!&#160; As they were leaving I said to the woman that you could die from the abortion for women have, which is a well kept secret.&#160; She just looked at me &amp; they left.&#160; Well, they were given lots of information to ponder.&#160;

also for Nat who was scheduled for an abortion today.&#160;&#160;Martha &amp; I&#160;spoke to her &amp; her boyfriend&#160;on two separate occasions &amp; gave them DVD's on Growth &amp; Development &amp; the Bella movie, also children's clothes &amp; diapers for&#160;their 2 daughters.&#160; We showed them pictures &amp; told them that we would help them during the pregnancy &amp; after.&#160; The boyfriend&#160;wants this precious baby dead because this baby is not his.&#160;

killed generations with this abortion.&#160; They just look at you, wait &amp; see!!&#160; We pleaded with the mothers to 'chose life' &amp; that we could help them &amp; that their baby had a heartbeat &amp; deserves a birthday &amp; not a death day.&#160; They deserved to be protected &amp; not harmed.&#160; I call the abortionist &amp; the workers at Planned Parenthood "bullies" &amp; tell them to pick on someone their own size.&#160;

It was sooo cute &amp; heartwarming to behold.&#160; They went back into the Material Aid Room to finish the deal.&#160; When they came out they walked passed me.&#160; The mom stopped to say hi to me &amp; the little girl saw the mega phone that I was holding &amp; said "I want that".&#160; I looked at her &amp; said "no honey".&#160; Then she said it again "I want that" &amp; pointed to the mega phone that I was holding.&#160; Again I said "no sweetheart, that's not for little girls".&#160; Then she tried to turn around the graphic sign, that I had turned around, so that she couldn't see it.&#160; I thought to myself&#160;'you little dickens'.&#160; Then the mom said in a quiet voice "she tired &amp; needs a nap".&#160; As they were walking away I heard the little girl say in a loud voice "I'M NOT TIRED".&#160;&#160; I said to them, "Bye Bye".&#160; In all my years I never&#160;met a child so young&#160;with such a strong&#160; personality as she had.&#160;&#160; She'll keep the mom busy that's for sure.&#160; She was so cute with the bows in her hair &amp; the determined look&#160;on her face.&#160; Come to find out that this mother lost her son after heart surgery when he was about&#160;8 momths&#160;old &amp; the little girl, who was born before her brothers death,&#160;names&#160;most of&#160;her stuffed animals Michael, after her deceased brother.&#160;

When I arrived at the center Martha, Tony, &amp; his wife Joy were there.&#160; Martha made coffee &amp; then Carole came in. I then received a phone call &amp; it was on of our moms who chose life needing me to pick her up at her new apartment to take her to the shelter for the last time before she moves into her new studio apartment.&#160; So I went to pick her up to take her to the shelter.&#160; She is now about 12 weeks pregnant &amp; things are looking up for her since she had the RU 486 pills taken out, about 4 weeks ago.&#160; When I picked her up she asked for me to stop at the corner store for a hot dog.&#160; They didn't have hot dogs but she came out with a piece of pizza instead.&#160; She was grateful that I had picked her up to take her to the shelter, for it was a cold day &amp; she hadn't worn her jacket. As I dropped her off I said to her that if she needed anything please just call me.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; said "good bye".&#160; Before I went back to the center I stopped at Wendy's to get a hamburger for lunch.&#160; When I got back to the center I stayed to eat my hamburger &amp; talk to Suzanne, our Thursday counselor, about some things.&#160; She was busy with a client in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I did a couple of things &amp; waited until she was finished &amp; sat down to talk to her about some upcoming events.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; it was a young girl needing a pregnancy test &amp; some children clothes.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again &amp; it was my friend Sue who was dropping off some diapers.&#160; She asked me how I was doing &amp; I said that I was in pain &amp; she prayed for me to God to heal me, she did that right in the hallway.&#160;

it was a painful experience for me.&#160; They are non practicing Catholics &amp; were so mixed up about so many things &amp; their Faith.&#160; I had said to them "you're mothers are pro life".&#160; And the one young man said "my mother is pro choice".&#160; I then said then you have some brothers or sisters in Heaven.&#160; This statement upset him &amp; he called his mother on his cell phone.&#160; She said&#160;that it was between her &amp; her God.&#160; The other guy mentioned that yellow was blue if he wanted it to be.&#160;He was treating God as a magician, it was soooo sad &amp; disturbing that's for sure.&#160;

I was trying to cross the street to approach the situation when the Death Escort left.&#160; The poor guys said&#160; that the baby in the womb wasn't a baby, then what was it??&#160; I told then that the baby's heart is beating at 18 to 21 days, after conception,&#160;in the womb &amp; that they were once in the womb &amp; they're human.&#160; How do you explain that??&#160; They were so messed up &amp; it was so sad.&#160;I heard them talking that they were planning to have more people come to join them next time.&#160;

There were only about 20 of us but we marched up and down the sidewalk and at one point said the Rosary together.&#160; We never saw Dr. Phelps but we made our presence known to those who went to the talk and when they exited after 8 PM.&#160; Off and on a car would drive by honking its horn in favor of us.&#160; However, one woman whom we assume attended the meeting told us she adopted children but did believe in abortion, adding that she works in a poor school and sees the bad side of what children go through and should not have to.&#160; That was the basis for her belief.&#160; She told us to adopt children so they can be spared miserable, unproductive lives but no one will because they're black.&#160; One of our protesters, a mother of 7, said she would adopt.<br />
&#160;<br />
Later, a young college-age looking woman who attended the talk approached us and in a friendly manner said she understood our protest but she believed in a woman's right to govern her own body.&#160; She said Dr. Phelps spoke on teen pregnancy and the effect of our culture on sexuality through the media, etc.&#160; Several of us tried to talk to her but she was quite glib although not verbally combative.&#160; One of the protesters loudly kept saying things to her, such as babies being killed, etc. and it was difficult for us to listen to her while he was talking.&#160; I told him to let her finish.&#160; She thanked me for that.&#160; It probably could have could have been a productive discussion with her, in my opinion, but the guy who was bizarre prevented that.&#160; At one point she said she was a Christian and I countered with killing isn't Christian or to that effect.&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />

a large microwave that Maria gave me to give to who needs it the most.&#160; It turned out to be one of the taxi drivers, for his wife's friend who just had a baby &amp; her husband is serving in another country, so she's alone without much.&#160; We at Focus gave her some blankets for&#160;her baby girl, a bassinet &amp; a baby swing but she needs more things, we're working on it.&#160; So many of our clients need so much I wish that I could service them more quickly.&#160; I do appreciate all the wonderful people that the Lord brings to us that blesses us with pac'n plays, baby &amp; children clothes, walkers, car seats, strollers etc..&#160; We couldn't run our pregnancy center without them :)&#160;&#160; Sandy, who helps us out on Tuesdays had just arrived to help get the boxes out of the car.&#160; Martha was making coffee, for she was tired &amp; needed a boost before going out to the front lines.&#160; Donna was already out there praying &amp; holding her sign which read 'CHOOSE LIFE...THERE'S HOPE'.&#160; John was with us today but I wanted him to stay in the center to do some office work, like writing thank you letters to the churches that have recently blessed us with a large tithing contribution for the work of the Focus Center.&#160; Also to make a sign for the outside that tells people driving by that we have 'free' baby &amp; children's clothes.&#160; He did some other creative projects too.&#160; He did help to bring some signs out to the sidewalk but just a few for it was sooo windy today.&#160; Martha was now out on the sidewalk, &amp; I always feel b<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.leavemeb.com/images/megaphone.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="80" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

talks to them using the megaphone.&#160; They need to hear the Truth in order for their hearts to be touched &amp; to turn away from Planned Parenthood.&#160; We offer them options like good doctors &amp; good people that can help them in their situation.&#160; We hand out the Truth packet, where&#160;they get a great amount of information, by the brochures that we have in the bag &amp; phone numbers too.&#160; I always feel good when they take that packet.&#160; </strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>After all the instructions that I gave John, whom I'm very grateful for, I went out with a sign to the sidewalk to join the team.&#160; Mary S. had arrived &amp; then the lady with the white dog.&#160; Don't get me wrong I'm not blaming the dog.&#160; This lady&#160; drove into Planned Parenthood with it looked like her older daughter in her late twenties or early thirties.&#160; She stopped the car to say to us to "get a life".&#160; "Oh yea", I said "we're trying to save t<a id="thumbnail" href="http://static.bigstockphoto.com/thumbs/3/9/1/large/1933072.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="120" height="79" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Off she went into the parking lot to park her car &amp; let her daughter out.&#160; Then she came out of the car with her white poodle on a leach.&#160; "I called over to her to tell her that children are more important than dogs, &amp; if she cared about animals then why can't she care about people too?&#160; Here she comes walking over to the fence, where we stand to call out to the people,&#160;when they&#160;get out of their cars.&#160;

Some come around the bushes to talk to us face to face, which is better for communication, though more dangerous for us.&#160; &#160;She rattled on &amp; on &amp; was saying nothing.&#160; Her poor dog probably thought she was crazy &amp; was embraced to be with her.&#160; See I told you that I wasn't blaming the dog.&#160; I asked Martha to take over &amp; again this poor lady ranted &amp; raved about, well we don't know???&#160; She went back to her car &amp; stayed there until she took her dog for another walk about 20 <a id="thumbnail" href="http://cache1.asset-cache.net/xc/87181404.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=2E9FE7AA997534C4524D022A13DEFB20A6073DAAEB9C879836E63A87E8F86225E30A760B0D811297"><img alt="See full size image" width="56" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

The third walk, for the person that she dropped off was still in there, for what I don't know.&#160; This time I was alone, it was about 4pm&#160;&amp; Martha was in the center doing a pregnancy test &amp; everyone else had gone.&#160; She turned the corner where the bushes are &amp; there she met me face to face.&#160; I really don't think that she though that we were still out there &amp; she wanted a longer walk for her dog.&#160; Surprise!!&#160; She snarled, not the dog but her, &amp; quickly pointed at the graphic pictures of the aborted baby that was decapitated.&#160; She said to me "you better be careful your condemning your soul, doing this" &amp; she pointed to the graphic sign.&#160; I said back to her "how can I be condemning my soul when I'm doing something good"?&#160; "It's your soul I'm worried about".&#160; Then I said "why are you not angry at the people in there that are doing this&#160;to the babies, pointing to the sign, but you're angry at us for showing you the truth"?&#160; She snarled once again &amp; walked away back to her car with her white poodle.&#160; Only God will be able to get through her.&#160; Martha was back outside with me now, it was about 4:20pm &amp; the woman with the dog &amp; her daughter were driving out of the Planned Parenthood parking lot.&#160; The car stopped &amp; the passenger rolled down the window &amp; said "they do other things in there not just abortions, they give out birth control to teenagers".&#160; "Really, birth control kills babies too, I said".&#160; The mouth of the driver hung down &amp; she started to mouth off again.&#160; Didn't understand a single work she mumbled.&#160; They drove off into the evening.&#160;They just didn't want to hear the Truth. &#160;Lord please help these two women &amp; bring them to your Truth.&#160; Amen.&#160; </strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.catbirdseat.org/catbirdseat/22.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="59" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;
