style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>This Mass was long because it was the Mass for the  Poor Souls in Purgatory &amp; when Mass ended I left &amp; Martha stayed &amp;  came to the center about 10 minutes later.&#160; When I went to the parking lot the  school buses were in the parking lot so it was hard to get out.&#160; I was hoping  that Lucy would&#160;be there so I called the taxi company &amp; asked&#160;Tickaboo if  someone was there already &amp;&#160;he said "yes".&#160; I said please let her into the  center &amp; tell her that I will be there in a few minutes &amp; thanks.&#160; He  said "okay" &amp; I hung up.&#160; I was there in less then 3 minutes.&#160; I thought it  was Lucy that was waiting for me at the center but it was one of our clients.&#160; I  said hello to her &amp; then opened up the Material Aid Room, for her to get  some things for her son.&#160; She said that the father of her baby was giving her  lots of problems.&#160; I was sad to hear this.&#160; Then Martha walked in &amp; went  right into the cabinet &amp; got the Holy Salt &amp; started to walk outside  sprinkling the Holy Salt everywhere were she walked.&#160; Then we turned the corner  only to see that the business next to Planned Parenthood, which we have had  problems with over the last 21 years, had opened up the gate that is where we  stand to talk to the girls going into &amp; coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160;  This was retaliation for calling the police on the young kid who almost ran  Martha over going so fast &amp; getting so close to the curb.&#160; I looked at  Martha &amp; said "I guess that Officer Mike hot a hold of the young man &amp;  told him to cool it on the road".&#160; We were happy about that but not about the  gate being opened.&#160; It restricts our sidewalk counseling quite a bit.&#160; We have  to stand further away to talk to the people at Planned Parenthood, which isn't  good &amp; it's not that effective.&#160; I believe  that Buckpitt &amp; Co.&#160;is not  pro life!!!&#160; Lord have Mercy on them.&#160; Martha &amp; I went back  into the center to get the literature box, mega phone &amp; some graphic signs  to take out to the front lines.&#160; As time went on I realized that Lucy, our  newest volunteer, wasn't coming today &amp; I found out later that she was out  of town.&#160; I hope that she comes next Tuesday, for we really need her.&#160; Martha  &amp; I did the best we could being so far away.&#160; We did talk to the girls that  came up &amp; down the sidewalk to give out Truth packets &amp; to talk to  them.&#160; We had no one helping us on the front lines today &amp; in the center  &amp; we had a lot of things to put away but I knew that Kathy &amp; Tazia &amp;  Paul would be there tomorrow.&#160; I expected the three Elim girls at 2:30pm today  but I received a phone call saying that on the girls came in contact with  peanuts &amp; she's highly allergic to them.&#160; She gave her self a Epi shot but  after that she needed to go to the Emergency Room for observation.&#160; The Elim  girls brought their friend to the hospital to give her support.&#160; Danielle said  "thank you for understanding".&#160; I said "no problem &amp; I hope &amp; pray that  she will be fine".&#160; Thank God for Martha otherwise I'd be by myself on the front  lines &amp; in the center.&#160; After so many hours out on the front lines we  decided to go into the center to do some work in there.&#160; Then Tucker came to  pray &amp; hold a sign for about an hour out on the front lines.&#160; I just  reminded him that he couldn't&#160;block the entrance of Buckpitt, where the gate is  open. &#160;He said "okay" &amp; then left.&#160;

going lots of paperwork.&#160; We ate supper together of  chicken, sweet potatoes &amp; salad &amp; then went home.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><div><span style="color:

soon afterwards.&#160; Kathy was already there Miss T is on her way &amp; Paul  was still on the front lines with Sheila.&#160; Suzanne will come later.&#160; I went out  with Kathy helping me bring out the signs &amp; mega phone &amp; the literature  box.&#160; On the sidewalk when Martha &amp; I came out was Adolf &amp; Dan &amp;  Bill too.&#160; It was a good team of prayer warriors &amp; people that also  witnessed to the Truth about the evils of abortion.&#160; I got to talk to Sheila for  a few minutes for a report of what went on during her time &amp; then she had to  go.&#160; Paul went to lunch &amp; I asked him for a hamburger at Wendy's, his  favorite place, &amp; that he was coming back after that to help in the center  to help Kathy &amp; Miss T.&#160; I am so appreciative of the indoor team too.&#160;  Martha was praying the Rosary &amp;&#160;I was sidewalk counseling.&#160; I saw that a  young girl, who was probably going in for an abortion, saw the graphic sign as  her &amp; her, I think, boyfriend drove in.&#160; I lost sight of them &amp; I don't  know how long they were in there &amp; I wonder if her seeing the graphic made a  difference &amp; she &amp; her boyfriend left with their baby still in her  womb.&#160; I hope so.&#160; One woman drove in smiling &amp; waving but not in a nice  way.&#160; She was there to pick up her daughter &amp; she didn't look to good as  they were leaving.&#160; I would like to do some research on the mother - daughter  connection &amp; how it affected their relationship, that a mother brought the  daughter in to have an abortion.&#160; I know of one &amp; it effected their  relationship quite a bit.&#160; The daughter blamed the mother for supporting her in  her decision to abort her child &amp; not trying to talk her out of doing the  very same thing that the mother once did in her past.&#160; Generational sin?&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family:

of having an abortion.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160; </strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span><span

the front lines this afternoon in front of Planned Parenthood, on the day  that they do surgical abortions, when a car stopped &amp; the older woman who  was the passenger called over to us saying "keep up the great work that you're  doing out here".&#160; We said that we would.&#160; Then the young girl who was driving  said that she had her 5 year old daughter in the back seat &amp; I put my head  in the car to see her, how sweet she was.&#160; Then Martha told them about Focus  &amp; the 'free' children's clothes that we have in the Material Aid Room &amp;  told them where we were located.&#160; They said "thank you &amp; good bye".&#160; We were  happy that they took our Truth packet filled with brochures, etc. &amp; our  DVD's &amp; CD's for educational purposes &amp; to pass it on to others to  educate them too.&#160; We were so happy &amp; encouraged by their positive presence  out there on the front lines.&#160; About 20 minutes later&#160;one of our volunteers from  Focus came out to tell&#160;me, for Martha was now in the center working,&#160;that when  they were in the Material Aid Room the daughter told the volunteer that it was  over&#160;5 years ago that she was going into Planned Parenthood to have an abortion  when she saw our signs &amp; turned away &amp; had her precious daughter who&#160;I  just met today.&#160; Praise God for this wonderful news!&#160; God is Good, God is  Great!!&#160; My heart was touched by this fantastic news!!</strong></span></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></p><p><strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha went back into the center around  4pm &amp; I stayed until 5pm.&#160; Miss T. came out every once in awhile to see how  I was doing.&#160; I was touched by her concern.&#160; Such a dear girl.&#160; I went in at 5pm  &amp; all the volunteers had left so it was Martha &amp; I.&#160; We did some work in  the center &amp; then ate Martha's famous chicken &amp; rice dish with a salad.&#160;  Mmmmm good.&#160; Then Martha left for Holy Hour &amp; I stayed to some more work  &amp; then I left to go to St. Jude's Church for the Holy Hour.&#160; This is where  we get our persistence &amp; strength to keep on going back to the front lines,  only through the grace of God!!!&#160;&#160; </span></span></strong></p><hr /><p><span

Parenthood</strong></span></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Martha &amp; I were coming back from noon Mass  downtown &amp; we saw a young girl, who we found out later, that she was 12  years old, walking down the street towards our center.&#160; By the time we parked  our cars she was by the front door.&#160; She had her pajamas on &amp; was barefoot  &amp; was carrying a big stick.&#160; Martha asked her to put the stick down, for  she said to me later on, that she thought that she was going to use the stick on  us.&#160; For whatever reason I wasn't afraid nor worried that she was going to use  the stick on us for I saw her expression on her face &amp; noticed that she looked  petrified.&#160; I asked her if we could help her &amp; she responded with caution  that she was looking for her grandfather, who rents an office in the hallway,  that we have our pregnancy center at.&#160; We invited&#160;her into the center &amp; I  knocked on his door to see if he was there.&#160; He wasn't.&#160; I planned to call him after I  found out more about the situation &amp; of course her name.&#160; I invited her into  the Green Room &amp; she sat down.&#160; I asked if she wanted anything to drink  &amp; she said that she would like some hot chocolate.&#160; "Yes" I said "we have hot  chocolate" &amp; preceded to prepare it for her.&#160; Martha &amp; I started to ask  her some questions &amp; found out that she was 12 years old &amp; developing, so  I though she was much older.&#160; She ran away from her abusive mother who was about  to beat her again with an extension cord.&#160; She hide in a vacant house on Conkey  Ave., which is a very dangerous street, &amp; after she stayed there for a time, she left with the stick that she picked up there, to go to see her grandfather.&#160; I gave  her a pad of paper to write down her feelings &amp; called her grandfather. I  was unable to reach him but left several messages for him to call me back ASAP.&#160; After about 5 calls I decided to call 911 &amp; ask to  speak to Officer Chris, our police advocate, &amp; ask him what I should do in this situation.&#160; I  waited to here back from him.&#160; In the meantime one of our regular clients came  in with her 10 year son.&#160; They spent some time in the Material Aid Room.&#160; She  also wanted me to write a referral letter, for her, to the Asbury Church for she needed some  household items for her new house that she had rented, along with her 4  children.&#160; Martha &amp; I were happy to hear that she was blessed with a big  house for her family.&#160; I went into the office &amp; wrote the letter &amp; gave  it to her as a referral for Asbury Church.&#160; I then offered, our young lady, if  she'd like some lunch but she said "no thank you".&#160; I was worried that she needed some food but excepted her answer.&#160; I then asked her to go into the Material  Aid Room to go get some clothes for herself to put on &amp; Martha gave her a wash  cloth, a bar of soap, a tooth brush &amp; paste &amp; some baby  powder, to refresh herself.&#160; She picked out a skirt &amp; a blouse &amp; went into  the bathroom to get cleaned up &amp; change into street clothes.&#160; When she came  out she looked better.&#160; She sat back down in the chair by the table to write on  the note pad.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; I walked down the hall to answer it.&#160; It  was Officer Chris who said "what's going on Mary".&#160; I invited him in &amp; told  him what was going on.&#160; When he walked in the Green Room, our poor girl looked at him with shock.&#160;  I told her that he was a nice officer &amp; that he was here to help her.&#160; He  talked to her for a awhile &amp; then called another police officer to come to take the report, for he had to go.&#160;  Then they called a Social Worker to come to speak to her.&#160; Just then the  grandfather called me back &amp; I told him what had happened &amp; I gave the  phone to Officer Chris to speak to him.&#160; I was told that the grandfather was on  his way to the center.&#160; I was glad.&#160; About 15 minutes later the Social Worker came in  &amp; took our young lady to the office to speak to her but before that happened  her grandfather came into the building &amp; when she saw him she ran over to  him &amp; gave him a big hug &amp; started to cry.&#160; It was so touching.&#160; In the  meantime we had other clients come into the Material Aid Room &amp; Martha helped  them out, for Kathy our volunteer,&#160;was away this week &amp; will be back next  week.&#160; I thanked Officer Chris, which told me that I wear my heart on my  sleeve &amp; to take a deep breath. Okay.&#160; He left &amp; the other police officer  stayed, to finish the report.&#160; The parking lot was filled with police cars, what a scene.&#160; After the  Social Worker was finished with talking to our girl she left with her  grandfather, who was taking her to his home, for the night, &amp; then was going to take her out  for a big supper. He had gone over to his daughter's house to pick up some clothes &amp; things for her, while she was talking to the Social Worker.&#160; I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when he went over to her house.&#160; It's really none of my business for I know way to much about family dynamics. &#160; Before she left she walked over to Martha &amp; gave her a hug  &amp; then she walked over to me &amp; gave me a long, big hug that touched my heart  &amp; all who saw it.&#160; She was so grateful for our help &amp; we were happy that she  was now 'safe'.&#160; I cried after she left.&#160; This is what the Lord had for Martha &amp;  I this afternoon at Focus.&#160; What a day!!!!!!<br /></strong></span></div><p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></p><div><strong> </strong></div><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p><div>&#160;&#160;</div><hr /><div class="ii gt" id=":6u"><div id=":6t"><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Wednesday, November 9, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></strong></span></span></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I were the only ones out on the front lines, as  usual.&#160; The weather was warm &amp; breezy today quite unusual for this  time of year but I'm not complaining.&#160; Martha prayed the Rosary while I  counseled.&#160; The neighbor who lives in the condo across the street that I  sent literature on What the Catholic Church Teaches on Contraceptives  &amp; Humane Vitae &amp; How to Respect People, holled over to us saying  "shut up over there".&#160; I guess he didn't read what I sent him.&#160; How  disrespectful to us women.&#160; Then a young girl heard what Martha was  saying for now she had the mega phone &amp; responded with giving Martha  her #1 IQ.&#160; I was angry when I saw her do this to Martha &amp; I told  her so.&#160; I said "how dare you show this wonderful woman such disrespect,  do you know that that symbol means something very bad &amp; would you  do that to your mother?&#160;&#160; Then I said "Lord have mercy on you" &amp; she  hollered over to us saying that she was Jewish.&#160; I said to her that you  will see the Lord after you die &amp; have to make an account of your  life to Him &amp; He is the Messiah".&#160; I saw her looking intently at the  picture of the Lord holding an aborted baby in His hands, that Martha  was holding n her hands&#160;&amp; then she went on the war path again using  her 'feminist finger' at us again &amp; then saying the dreaded F word.&#160;  Such a lady!&#160; The last thing that she heard me say to her as she was  angrily driving out of the parking lot was "shame on you".&#160; Even though  this was unpleasant it's always better to see that the girls that holler  the most&#160;still have a conscious &amp; are not stoic, which scared the  bejibbidies out of me.&#160; Something that Martha said did bother her &amp;  she reacted.&#160; We hope that she finds the Risen Lord &amp; repents.&#160; </span></div></strong></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><div>&#160;<span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I&#160;

some boys clothes for the Material Aid Room.&#160; I said that  would be right over.&#160; I told Martha &amp; went over to greet him &amp;  to let him into the center for the drop off.&#160; His daughter did a  Fundraising Event at their parish &amp; sold her famous pro life  cupcakes after all the Masses &amp; made for us $240.00 as a donation to  our work.&#160; God bless her &amp; her parents for such a wonderful gift of  her time &amp; love to our mothers &amp;

She said that she was  going to go to Planned Parenthood for a pregnancy test.&#160; Then Martha  said to her why don't I give you one in the center &amp; she replied  "okay'.&#160; Off the three of them went to the center to be taken of &amp;  treated like real people, with respect &amp; love &amp; kindness.&#160; I  continued to call over to the people going in &amp; coming out of  Planned Parenthood when Danielle one of the Elim students came over to  me.&#160; It was now 2:30pm &amp; all three girls had arrived to work in the  center for 2 hours, which I'm very thankful.&#160; </span></div></strong></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div></div></div><hr /><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Thursday, November 10, 2011 in front of Planned  Parenthood</strong></span></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I arrived at 1pm &amp; went to the front lines to  ask&#160;for assistance from Dan &amp; Chris, who were with Sheila praying,&#160;if they  would bring out more signs out&#160;to the front lines, for me.&#160; I gave them my keys  &amp; while they were gone I spoke with Sheila &amp; asked her what had happened  on her time.&#160; She said that a mother &amp; father had brought their daughter to  Planned Parenthood to get the depo shot &amp;&#160; they told her that they were pro  life.&#160; What!!&#160; Then Sheila gave them the Truth packet to read &amp; to get  educated to what was going on here at Planned Parenthood &amp; information about  the deadly depo shot.&#160; They took the packet which pleased Sheila.&#160; Another  couple were walking down the street &amp; Sheila spoke with them &amp; they told  her that they were pro life &amp; she gave them a Truth packet &amp; off they  went walking down the street.&#160; She was happy about that too.&#160;Sheila had to go so  I said "thanks Sheila &amp; good bye".&#160; Martha was in the center getting a cup  of hot soup for she was cold &amp; hungry.&#160; I knew that she will join me as soon  as she could.&#160; I spoke with Chris, on the front lines, for he started to ask me  questions when the graphic signs started to arrive outside.&#160; I could tell from  his voice that he had some issues with them. I know that the signs saves lives  &amp; that's all I care about.&#160; I can't get into peoples heads to how they will  respond to the violence on the signs, for abortion is violent, I can only hope  &amp; pray that the girls will see the Truth&#160;&amp; not go into Planned  Parenthood to do that to their own baby.&#160; I have been told by so many women,  though one was enough for me, that by seeing the signs when they arrived at  Planned Parenthood that they couldn't go through with&#160; the abortion.&#160; That's  what I want to hear!!&#160; I left him with some food for thought &amp; I respected  him to challenging me to how he felt.&#160; We're there not for ourselves but for the  mothers &amp; for the babies that have 'no voice'.&#160; I hope that he comes back on  my time soon, though I think that he usually comes when Sheila is out there.&#160; I  doubt that I scared him away.&#160; Martha was now out on the sidewalk with Chris,  Dan, Bill who was across the street, Adolf, who had just arrived, &amp; I.&#160;  &#160;Some cars where now driving in &amp; I felt lead by the Holy Spirit to take the  prayer car 'My Life Depends on You'&#160; to the brick side of the building to read  it to those who had just come in.&#160; I read the poem using the mega phone &amp;  then started to talk some more when all of a sudden I heard a voice screaming at  to "shut up, just shut your mouth, shut up, I don't care".&#160; I looked around to  see that a man was in a truck parked in the parking lot not to far away from  me.&#160; I said that they were killing babies in there &amp; he hollered over to me  that they couldn't afford a baby.&#160; I started to jump up &amp; down stating that  you don't kill babies for any reason &amp; that your child has a heart beat  &amp; they we have a pregnancy center 2 doors down the street &amp; that we  could help &amp; that adoption was a loving thing to do but not murder for that  was what abortion was.&#160; Just then the Death Escort came over to the truck &amp;  stuck her head into the truck telling him not to get upset &amp; for him to move  his truck down further in the parking lot but before she could finish there was  a white fluffy dog in her face trying to lick it.&#160; Poor doggie!&#160; Dogs don't know  good people from evil acting people for I can't blame him for getting so close  to her.&#160; Bad taste little doggie.&#160; Well when I saw the dog I flipped &amp; said  to him that the dog was more important then your own son or daughter?&#160; Hoe could  this be for it's twisted.&#160; Just then the Death Escort left the truck &amp; the  truck moved further down the way.&#160; What I learned later on was that he was in  the truck but so was the girlfriend I just couldn't see her for she was the one  who was driving.&#160; A few minutes later I saw&#160;a girl walking to the door of  Planned Parenthood &amp; I called over to saw a few words to her before she went  into the Killing Mill.&#160; Again, I didn't realize that she was the girlfriend of  the guy I was talking to after I read the poem.&#160; Then all of a sudden the guy  drove out of Planned Parenthood &amp; went over to the vets &amp; walked his dog  into the vets for care.&#160; I hollered over to him that he cared more for his dog  than for his own child &amp; that if could afford a dog then he could afford a  baby too.&#160; Tom was walking up &amp; around the neighbor saying his Rosary &amp;  when he was walking passes the vets I told him that the guy in there was having  his baby killed over at Planned Parenthood &amp; he just stood there just  looking at him in the waiting room not saying anything just praying.&#160; The man  went into the examining room &amp; was gone.&#160; I then told Martha that I was  going into the center for a few minutes to recoup for my heart was aching.&#160; I  was in the center talking with Suzanne who had just arrived &amp; then came back  out to the sidewalk.&#160; Martha said that while I was gone his girlfriend walked  out of Planned Parenthood &amp; crossed the street to go to the vets &amp;  almost got killed as she was crossing the street.&#160; Martha said that she screamed  over to her to tell her to watch out &amp; she responded back to Martha to "shut  up".&#160; Martha said that she was trying to save her life.&#160; I know that she must  have seen the graphic, signs when she crossed over to the vets, which hopeful  affected her. to change her mind about going through with the abortion.&#160; I  walked over to the fence &amp; I saw that they were giving each other a kiss as  she was starting to go back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I called over to her  saying "how can you kill the product of your love"?&#160; In she went into the front  door opened up for her by the friendly Death Escorts, for there were two of them  now,&#160;on guard duty to the Killing Camp.&#160; The boyfriend or husband got into the  truck &amp; off he went up the street.&#160; I said to the Lord "if she come out in  20 minutes then I'll know that she didn't have her precious baby killed".&#160; After  10 minutes I had to go back into the center to eat my hamburger from Wendy's  that Paul had bought me.&#160; I was gone for about 10 minutes &amp; when I came back  out I noticed that the truck with the girl &amp; guy were driving out of Planned  Parenthood.&#160; I hollered over to them "God bless you" &amp; they both gave me the  #1 symbol to which I was glad not sad because they, through the grace &amp;  power of God had changed their minds to which they will be forever grateful  especially in about 7 months when they'll be holding their precious child in  their arms.&#160; Thank you Lord for this battle was fierce but victorious.&#160; The team  knew that I was upset &amp; they prayed that much harder. </strong></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I was so very happy that I went up to Martha &amp;  gave her a big hug then went back into the center for they knew what was  happening out on the front lines for I told them when I came in for a fast  lunch.&#160; I screamed even before I got to the center that a baby was saved &amp;  continued the screaming when I went into the center&#160;to tell Suzanne, Paul &amp;  Janet&#160;&amp; her children.&#160; They were all so happy too :)</strong></span></span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>In the meantime, one our  regular clients came in for some guidance from Suzanne, &amp; to use the phone.&#160; I  was a little upset&#160;for she goes into Planned Parenthood for rape counseling  too.&#160; Today I asked her to make a decision if she wanted us to help her or them  &amp; that it couldn't be both.&#160; I told that she deserved an advocate that was  pro life &amp; not pro death &amp; they're in the same building,&#160;where they're  killing, little babies.&#160; I said that we will connect her with the Catholic  Family Center for an advocate.&#160; I wanted to be patient with her for I am also a  rape survivor &amp; I didn't want to secondly wound her, for I wanted to be  gentle &amp; loving yet stern, in a good way.&#160; She said that she wanted  "justice" for what happened to her &amp; I said that you might not get it &amp;  will have to wait until the next life but that I admired her for trying &amp;  that we wanted to&#160;help make that possible for her&#160;too.&#160; I then aid "you might  get justice I just don't want you devastated if you don't receive it, that 's  all".&#160; Her expectations are so high that she might be put in a depression if it  doesn't go her way.&#160; I just wanted to protect her.&#160; Suzanne spent some time with  her in the Rose Room &amp; I left to go back out to the front lines.&#160; It was  Martha's turn to go into the center to get warmed up for the day was cold.&#160; We  had some very nice days earlier this week but now it was turning cold, like it  should be.&#160; I didn't dress very warm today but I didn't mind.&#160;

she waved at me.&#160; She didn't appear to be trying to get my goat  or anything like that so when she came out about an hour later &amp; waved at me  again &amp; asked her why she was waving at me?&#160; She rolled down her window  &amp; said"&#160; I was here for I'm a deaf interrupter".&#160; I then quickly responded  back to her saying "I remember you, you're a nice lady that doesn't like to be  here, but has to".&#160; "Yes" she said &amp; I want to tell you to keep on doing  what your doing, for it's making a difference in there,&#160;I thank you &amp; I love  you all".&#160; I said "thank you so much for we will keep on fighting the good fight  &amp; thank you for your words of encouragement &amp; God bless you".&#160; She  smiled &amp; as she was driving out onto the street she hollered back at me  again "I love you"!!&#160; Boy, thank you Lord for giving us another&#160;blessing&#160;this  afternoon&#160;:)&#160; WOW..... we needed that!!</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Martha was back outside &amp; I asked her if she  would go over to the brick side of the building to pray the prayer again of "My  Life Depends on You".&#160; She took the prayer &amp; the mega phone &amp; went to  the brick side of the building to pray the powerful prayer.&#160; Dan &amp; Adolf  were still with us praying for Chris &amp; Bill had gone. I was by&#160; myself on  the bush side of the building by the fence by Buckpitt &amp; Co..&#160; The older  woman Death Escort had left so there was just the young woman greeting &amp;  opening the doors for the women to have their babies killed.&#160; In the meantime I  was trying to talk to two young men that brought heir girlfriends to Planned  Parenthood to have their children killed.&#160; One was smoking by the front door  &amp; I told him to be a man &amp; to protect his child &amp; the girl that he  brought in &amp; that you can't smoke in Planned Parenthood but you can have you  son or daughter killed in there".&#160; The one young guy went to his truck to let  out his big brown dog.&#160; It made me feel sick to my stomach that he cared more  about his dog then his own flesh &amp; blood.&#160; This was the second time today  that someone brought their dog with him but the first guy &amp; girl went home,  I didn't think that this would be the case with these two men today.&#160; I then  centered my attention to the young girl who was wearing the blue apron that  stated&#160;on it 'PLANNED PARENT ESCORT'.&#160; How wonderful for you to advertise your  position.&#160; How sick, how&#160;very sad.&#160;&#160;&#160;I told her a couple of things that she  should&#160;know about &amp; then I continued to sidewalk counsel others, that were  going into this horrible evil place, that murders little&#160;people.&#160; It was about  10 minutes later that&#160;saw a police car drive up the street which wasn't unusual  but this time the car had turned around &amp; came over to the curb, where  Martha was still talking on the mega phone &amp; he got out of the car &amp;  walked towards Planned Parenthood &amp; stopped to speak to the escort.&#160; I  couldn't imagine of any complaint against any of us out there for we just tell  the Truth &amp; we never threaten anyone or swear or curse anyone.&#160; About 3  minutes later Dan said that he would stay with me until the police left.&#160; I said  "thanks Dan that's real nice of you".&#160; Then I saw that the police officer was  walking over towards me.&#160; "It figures" I said to myself.&#160; I realized that I was  the one mostly talking today so it would be me that the police would be called  about something, perhaps.&#160; I said "hello officer, what's the problem".&#160; He  walked over to me &amp; said "we received a call about you harassing the woman  in the blue apron but I told her that it wasn't harassment".&#160; I said back to him  "what&#160;was it I said".&#160; He replied "you said something about if she doesn't  repent then she's heading for the firs of hell".&#160; I said "that's correct  officer".&#160; He said back to me that I should try not to be insulting".&#160; I said  "Officer we try to save lives &amp; souls out here".&#160; I then added that we have  a pro life advocate &amp; his name is Officer Chris".&#160; He said that he's his  friend".&#160; I said "that's great &amp; please say "hi" to me from me &amp;  thanks".&#160; Then he said "just don't go over the yellow line &amp; added&#160;that I  know more about the ins &amp; outs out here,&#160;then he does".&#160; "Okay Officer &amp;  thanks so much &amp; have a great day"!&#160; Another police car came &amp; he told  him that all was well &amp; for him to go.&#160; After they both left I was so happy  that she finally responded to what I was saying to her &amp; I felt for the  first time that there was hope for her soul.&#160; It was about 15 minutes later that  she took off the apron of death &amp; walked out&#160;to the sidewalk to go home.&#160; As  she was leaving I said to her to "Google the word HARASSMENT", in a nice tone of  voice.&#160; She turned around at me &amp; gave me a half smile.&#160; Martha said a few  words to her too as she walked passed her on the brick side of the building.&#160;  Then the Holy Spirit got a hold of my tongue &amp; spoke these words through me  on the mega phone.&#160; "When you are finally are convicted that what you are doing  at Planned Parenthood is so wrong &amp; so evil &amp; need a shoulder to cry on  we will be there for you &amp; when you have nightmares 3 in the morning just  call me &amp; I'll be there for you, for Planned Parenthood won't be, for&#160;we are  here for you"!!&#160; She seemed to have listened &amp; I hope that she won't be back  &amp; that she will repent.&#160; Like I said "if she ever needs us we will be there  for her during her difficult time when she realizes, what she has done over  these past 2 years, as a Death Escort, at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Lord have Mercy on  her soul &amp; thank you for her response which means that she's getting  convicted.&#160; In all my 27 years, on the front lines, I have never had an Escort  at an abortion mill ever called the police on me.&#160; Yeah!!!!</strong></span></span></div></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Now the girls were coming out after their abortions  &amp; it's never pretty.&#160; A car drove into the parking lot&#160;&amp; picked up a  young girl &amp; reversed back out instead of turning around.&#160; His car windows  were tinted so I couldn't see who was&#160;driving but I knew it was a guy by his  actions with the car.&#160; A young man came &amp; picked up a young girl that was  walking funny &amp; was caring a brown bag full of post abortion instructions  &amp; condoms, for some of the girls while leaving, have thrown them at us.&#160;  Dan&#160;&amp; Adolf had left &amp; Tom, who says the Rosary, up &amp; down the  street &amp; all around Planned Parenthood was still with me, for Martha had to  go into the center for she was to cold to be out there any longer.&#160; I wanted to  wait for the two guys, that was smoking &amp; the other who was walking his dog,  to leave with their girlfriends.&#160; Just as Tom &amp; I were talking the UPS truck  came whizzing by us, blowing some our signs down, that are on the sidewalk.&#160; I  asked Tom if he had any paper &amp; I took out a pen from my pocket &amp; he  went over to the truck to get his license number &amp; the truck number.&#160; When I  call again the UPS it will be my third &amp; final time for if there is no  resolving the situation this time I will call the police &amp; make out a report  on him for his unsafe driving.&#160; If two compliment were made in the past&#160;then why  is he&#160;still driving so close to the curb where we are standing???&#160; When it  starts to snow &amp; it's slippery out there, he could jump the curb &amp; hit  us who are standing there, so that the people driving by can see us with&#160;our  signs.&#160; We are not in the street &amp; where we are standing we have a right to  be there &amp; not to feel threatened by a UPS truck.&#160; I only wish that UPS  would transfer him to another route &amp; replace him with a good UPS driver,  who will be careful as he delivers packages daily, to Buckpitt &amp; Co next  door to Planned Parenthood.&#160; Please Lord please!!!&#160; </strong></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Tom &amp; Martha brought the signs into the center  &amp; I stayed outside until the two guys left with their so- called  girlfriends, the mothers of their children who were killed here today, without  mercy.&#160; I heard the front door open of Planned Parenthood&#160;&amp; saw a young  woman walk out &amp; heading to the truck.&#160;The guy was&#160;in the truck  &amp;&#160;another man, who was older, was&#160;in the drivers seat.&#160; He probably was her  father &amp; the young man was either&#160;her boyfriend or brother.&#160; When she walked  to the car&#160;I told that she needed to repent for what she did in there today.&#160;  She gave me her middle finger with such anger.&#160; I then called over to her saying  "don't hate me for I was trying to tell&#160;you not to do it"&#160; When the truck was  leaving she reached in front of the young man next to her &amp; continued to  give me her middle finger.&#160; I told them all to repent&#160;for the sin of murder  &amp; to ask God to forgive them &amp; to get help.&#160; My heart is so heavy &amp;  sad.&#160; Then about 15 minutes later, the guy with the big brown dog, came out with  his girlfriend.&#160; I said the same thing to both of them.&#160; As they drove by me, on  the sidewalk,&#160;the guy said something to me out the car window &amp; the girl  just glared at&#160;me.&#160; I then&#160;said to them&#160;that&#160;they're life will never be the same  again &amp; to repent for the sin of murder.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that all of  them will repent &amp; never repeat this abomination &amp; Deadly &amp;  Mortal&#160;&#160;Sin, ever&#160;again .&#160; So many woman, who have had one abortion, will &#160;go  for a repeat abortion in the future.&#160;

After about 15 minutes she left &amp; we noticed that  she was from another state.&#160; How sad that she was so confused about 'life' &amp;  how we were out there to defend it!!!&#160; Maybe someday.....</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>A young woman was walking up the sidewalk &amp;

that she was here for a  physical.&#160; We gave her a Truth packet &amp; some DVD's to take home with her.&#160;  Also, I gave her a doctors list &amp; since she asked about STD testing I gave  her a Compass Care brochure.&#160; We also told her about Focus that we give out free  children's clothes &amp; she said that she has a 4 year old son.&#160; I said come on  over when you get done for we have many nice clothes.&#160; She said that she will  &amp; off she went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; She came out about 20 minutes  later, so I think that she was there for STD testing &amp; she then walked over  to the center, for some clothes for her son.&#160;

I told him that's  exactly what his girlfriend is doing by talking the Depo shot &amp; offered him  the Truth packet, for educational purposes, which he took.&#160; He took with some  skepticism at the graphic pictures that I was holding &amp;

So very painful &amp; difficult.&#160; I told  him that sex outside of marriage was wrong &amp; was a serious sin &amp; did he  believe in the Lord.&#160; He said that he did &amp; I said then what would the Lord  say to you &amp; he said "to wait until marriage".&#160; "That's right" I said, as he  walked back to his car waiting for his girlfriend to come out.&#160; She came out  about 20 more minutes &amp; I didn't say anything to them on the way out because  &amp;

 Martha was taking a friend for a test &amp; would come after that.&#160; When I  arrived in the parking lot I saw a red van driving into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I  couldn't find a parking spot &amp; I was frustrated for I wanted to talk to the  person in the van before he or she went in.&#160; I finally found a spot &amp;  quickly went over to the bush side of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Just then I saw a man  &amp; a boy who was about 4 years old coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp;  getting into the red van.&#160; I called over to him, without the mega phone for&#160;I  just got out of my car, I hollered over to him that this place kills babies.&#160; He  said "yes I know I was here to get directions, &amp; then he got back into the  van.&#160; When he came back out he stopped where I was standing &amp; said "I was  her getting directions to the place where they give out free diapers".&#160; I said  "come &amp; follow me for I will take you there for it's just around the  corner".&#160; He said "great" &amp; followed me with his vehicle.&#160; He came into the  parking lot &amp; got out with his son &amp; walked over to where I was standing  as I was holding the door open.&#160; I introduced myself to him &amp; said that we  were here to assist him with his needs &amp; opened up the Material Aid Room so  he &amp; his son could go in.&#160; I gave him a bag &amp; told him to get what he  needed for his family.&#160; He said that he &amp; his wife had 4 children &amp;  would never abort any of them.&#160; He said that he couldn't understand anyone that  could.&#160; I agreed with him, for I can't either. He said that after being over at  Planned Parenthood he's going home to take a shower.&#160; I said that I couldn't  blame him.&#160; I then asked him when he went in there &amp; asked for free diapers  what did they say to you.&#160; He said that the girl at the desk said "they're over  there".&#160; I said that I was glad that the good Lord had me there when you came  out for we are hard to find unfortunately.&#160; He asked for some diapers for his 2  smaller children &amp; I went into the Great Room to get them &amp; some baby  wipes too.&#160; He was so happy.&#160; He introduced his son to me &amp; said that his  name was Mohammed.&#160; He looked Oriental for I think that he was adopted which is  a very good thing.&#160; He thanked me again &amp; as they were leaving I told him to  come back anytime that he needed us.&#160; He said "thank you" &amp; off they went.&#160;  What a wonderful experience this was.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I opened all the rooms of Focus &amp; then went to  the car to get out what I had brought with me, to bring into the center, for  the&#160;pregnancy centers, directors meeting tonight at 6pm.&#160; I brought in Mexican  food for&#160;our supper.&#160; I hope that everyone likes it.&#160;&#160;I went into the office to  do some paper work when the doorbell rang.&#160; It was Valerie coming to pick up a  bag of clothes that she had picked out yesterday but couldn't bring with her,  for she had a big bag of blankets to carry on the bus yesterday.&#160; I was happy to  see her.&#160; We talked for a few minutes &amp; then I gave her some phone numbers  to call to see if they could help her get a house for her &amp; her 4 children.&#160;  The youngest are her 6 month old twins, a boy 7 a girl, then a 2 year old girl  &amp;&#160;then a 10 year old boy.&#160; She's working with DSS but they made a mistake  &amp; it's been difficult for her &amp; her family until they make 'a wrong a  right'.&#160; It'll work out for God is always faithful.&#160; Thank God that Martha  showed up &amp; after that it was a blur, for the doorbell never stopped ringing  &amp; there were 3 requests for pregnancy tests, which Martha administered,  while I was busy with other things.&#160; The doorbell rang again &amp; it was our  newest mom with her&#160;2 week old baby &amp; her mother, the grandmother, of this  beautiful baby girl.&#160; Thank God that she 'chose Life' with the help of her  mother.&#160; She received some brand new infant clothes &amp; I asked if she could  stay until the&#160;three&#160;Elim Bible Institute students arrived.&#160; Today they were 10  minutes late for Danielle stopped to treat the girls to hot coffee.&#160; They were  so delighted to hold a newborn baby in their arms today.&#160; I thanked the mom  &amp; her mother that they waited for the girls to arrive, to bless them with  this wonderful experience.&#160; We all said "good bye" to the newest Focus family  &amp; off they went back home with many nice things for baby.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">A woman came into Focus for a pregnancy test &amp;  it was positive.&#160; This will be her 5th child....

 Her husband was in the car with the family waiting for her go come out.&#160; He lost  his job &amp; is over qualified to obtain work at this time but is looking, of  course.&#160; She was happy about the pregnancy &amp; also about the Focus Center  helping her family out during this very difficult time.&#160; Glad to be a help for  your family &amp; for all the families that need us &amp; our services.&#160; You all  are in our hearts &amp;

hold  a his favorite sign, of the three babies, out on the sidewalk&#160;for about 40  minutes.&#160; Martha &amp; I were to busy to go outside this afternoon  unfortunately.&#160; I was sad that there were no other people out there, when Martha  &amp; I need to take care of our clients, at Focus.&#160;I wish that I&#160;could be two  places at once but I can't be &amp; besides where are the people??&#160; There should  be other people either volunteering at Focus so that Martha &amp; I are out on  the front lines or they are on the front lines while Martha &amp; I are in the  center helping out our&#160;clients, who need us. &#160;Apathy is killing our  children!!&#160;</span></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Martha gave out two more pregnancy test which were  both negative &amp;

God bless them all.&#160; The Elim girls  had to go for it was 4:30pm now,&#160; &amp; said that they won't be here the  following week, for it would be the day before Thanksgiving.&#160; I said that I  would miss them &amp; gave each of them a hug good bye.&#160; They are such a  blessing to us at the center &amp; they really enjoy it too.&#160;&#160;Martha &amp;  I&#160;plan, the next time that they come back, to spend some quality time with them  &amp; to sit them down &amp; we will all have a&#160;great talk to get to know them a  little better, if of course that we're not to&#160;busy, &amp; the doorbell isn't  ringing off the&#160;door.&#160;We'll see if&#160;it will work for sometimes my plans  don't.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">It was about 5:15pm now &amp;

that we can hopefully implement them to our center,  so that we can better serve&#160;our clients.&#160; It's real hard to get everyone  together, that's for sure but I tried.&#160;&#160;</span></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The first meeting went very well &amp;

So much to learn.&#160; The more  I know, the more I can share with our clients, to get them the&#160;assistance that  they need to have better lives in Christ.&#160; What a very busy but very fruitful day, in the  Lord, in serving Him.&#160;

I  arrived a little earlier today so that I could do some things in the center  before I went outside on the street.&#160;I spoke with Sheila first to get a report  on what went on &amp; she told me that she spoke with a woman&#160;who was picking up  a young girl.&#160; I don't know if she had anything to do with it or not but she did  stop the car to receive a Truth packet.&#160; Sheila saw the face of the young girl  &amp; said to her "did you have an abortion"?&#160; She replied with tears in her  eyes that she just did.&#160; Sheila told her what she had done was wrong &amp; a  serious sin that God can forgive &amp; not to do it ever again.&#160; The woman  driver said "thank you" &amp; then drove away.&#160; This scenario could have been  that the young girl was brought in by a taxi or a so-called friend &amp; then  needed a ride back home &amp; then called her mother who didn't know that she  just had an abortion &amp; was heart sick about it &amp; wanted some  information.&#160; Only God knows the stories, we only judge the current situation,  that they are here to have their baby killed, &amp; not their hearts. Abortion  is a very serious, deadly &amp; mortal sin that must be forgiven by God, with an  sincere heart, otherwise you're condemning your soul to the fires of eternal  Hell.&#160; Lord have Mercy!!&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sheila had to go &amp; there was Bill, who sits  across the street, with his sign&#160;&amp; then Adolf, Martha hadn't arrived  yet.&#160;She came later around 1:20pm or so. I saw that they were demolishing the  garage &amp; the telemarketing building, across the street by the&#160;three condos.&#160;  This is where we were thinking of having our pregnancy center re located but God  had other plans &amp; that was for us to stay where we are but in an improved  atmosphere.&#160; All is well where we are now, some changes had occur first, for  this to happen.&#160; Thank God.&#160; There were big trucks &amp; the workers, then  the&#160;two Jim's came out of their condos, next door.&#160;&#160;These are the guys that are  disrespectful &amp; are annoying to us who are across the street trying to save  &amp; change lives.&#160; Then there were more men, I guess in the neighborhood,  coming to watch.&#160; It's such a shame that for this entertainment they all come  out but when little children are being massacred (deliberately and violently kill a large number of people)  at Planned Parenthood they all stay in their houses. They only come out  to harass us, on the front lines.&#160; Go figure??&#160; Their proprieties are all off.&#160;  How sad, how evil!&#160; Silence is Acceptance..... how could they??&#160; Their lack of  caring, where they're killing innocent &amp; defenseless people, is inhumane  &amp; dangerous, to one's own soul.&#160; The sin of omission, is as serious &amp;  even more so, than the sin of commission.&#160; Do something to end abortion, through  prayer, making phone calls, writing letters, or peacefully protesting, in your  community, an abortion mill.&#160; Just do something!!&#160; </span></span></strong></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><font>I went back to the center to&#160;see Suzanne, our  client advocate, for a minute, for Kathy, our volunteer, who&#160;was already there  working in the center.&#160; As I was leaving after just a few minutes gone from the  front lines though Martha was there I saw Pat, our grandmother &amp; great  grandmother pull into the parking lot.&#160; I walked over to her &amp; said "hi  Pat".&#160; She said "hi" back to me.&#160; She said that she wanted to be on the front  lines to speak the Truth.&#160; I said that sounds good to me.&#160; Off we go to be with  Martha.&#160; Pat took the mega phone &amp; she gave Planned Parenthood a piece of  her mind.&#160; She told them to stop killing Black children &amp; White children  too.&#160; She went on &amp; on &amp; on.&#160; You go girl!!!&#160; She rattled their cage for  Rick Bartell walked out with the Death Escort Barry Swan to see who was  speaking.&#160; The saw Pat.&#160; I walked over to the other side of the street to  witness there, while Pat &amp; Martha was on the other side of the street along  with Adolf, Bill had left.&#160; I walked over to the men who were standing there  like a bump on the log looking at the building being demolished &amp; I said, as  I was holding a graphic sign, this is what they do over there.&#160; Go away &amp;  shut up will ya, said one of the gentleman, I use this word loosely.&#160; It was so  disturbing the disrespect that these older men give to us woman across the  street.&#160; I walked by them praying &amp; then Jim Martin who lives in the one  condo who is the neighborhood busy body said "Mary leave these men alone" &amp;  then he walked fast into his condo, as if to call the police.&#160; I knew that the  police couldn't do anything to me but it's still a pain.&#160; They never came, thank  you Lord for it would have&#160;taken my precious time away from what I need to do  out there, on the front lines.&#160; I finally returned to be with the team across  the street &amp; witness there.&#160; Pat finally had to leave but she spent about an  hour &amp; a half out there in the cold witnessing.&#160; She said that she will be  back with some more grandma's.&#160;&#160;

I try to stay out until about 5pm.&#160; It's always  very hard to see the girls&#160;come out, in the cars,&#160;after they had their little  babies killed.&#160; The driver is a mess too or they are belligerent.&#160; I tell them  to repent of the sin of murder &amp; to the driver I say repent of being an  accomplice to murder if they were the ones who drove them in.&#160; God only knows  why they would do this to their baby &amp;

Tim came over to the center to help me after he stopped first at  Wendy's to get us a hamburger. </strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> I had to go outside to get something out of  my car &amp; I looked&#160; up the sidewalk to see that Adolf was there praying, out  in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I walked over to him to say hi, I didn't have  my coat on &amp; it was chilly.&#160; As I was there speaking to him a car was  pulling out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I saw that there was a black woman &amp; the  male driver was white, in the car.&#160; As I was speaking to the woman, I noticed  that&#160;she&#160;was looked at me intently as I told her about Planned Parenthood's  agenda of the Black Race &amp; how they are targeting&#160;her race &amp; killing her race off through abortion &amp; birth control.&#160; I also said that they don't care  about you.&#160; The male driver was making a right hand turn &amp; he&#160; slowed down where I  was standing&#160;&amp; as&#160;he drove by me he&#160;said an offensive word to me.&#160; I hope  that this young woman will have her eyes opened up about Planned Parenthood  &amp; her boyfriend too.&#160; I pray that today will be the first day of the rest of  her life!!&#160; Thank you Lord....&#160; As Adolf&#160;&amp; I were talking once again a  young&#160;girl was walking&#160;down, on the other side of the street,&#160;talking loudly to  herself.&#160; We both looked at each other .&#160; &#160;As she was coming closer to us I  called over to her &amp; she walked across the street to where I was standing  with Adolf.&#160; I got to tell her Truth about no sex before your married &amp; she  replied&#160;back to me that she wasn't taught that &amp; she already has.&#160; I said to  her that she won't be held accountable to what she didn't know about but&#160;once  she knew it she will be held accountable for the sin.&#160; She agreed that was only  fair.&#160; She said "all over the world they're having sex right now".&#160; I said "yes  that's probably true but you have to be married first.&#160; I said that people  changed that rule,&#160;but God never has changed that rule that you can't.&#160;  I&#160;pointed to where the Focus center was if ever she or any of her family or  friends needed us.&#160; She smiled &amp; said "thank you" &amp; off she went walking  down the sidewalk.&#160; I had to say "good bye" to Adolf for it was getting colder  but first he challenged me on my approach to people on the front lines,&#160;at  times.&#160; I was cold &amp; I had to justify my style of sidewalk counseling, so  here it goes.&#160; "Adolf",&#160;I said, "I am not perfect &amp; I pray &amp; rely on the  Holy Spirit to speak through me &amp; at times I'm even surprised&#160;of what comes  out of&#160;my mouth, for He knows the people better than I do".&#160; It's a call of  urgency of what they are about to do to their baby &amp; their own life, at  Planned Parenthood.&#160; It's a call of 'tough' love &amp; pleading with them to  'choose life' &amp; not death.&#160; Also, I don't want to come across as a victim  out there for none of us are but we freely give information &amp; assistance to  those who want&#160;it.&#160; If there was&#160;a child crossing the street &amp; a car was  coming, I think that you would raise your voice of impending danger to this  child, &amp; run into the street to&#160;save him or her from being killed.&#160; As for  the graphic signs they 'save' lives &amp; that's what it's all about out here,&#160;I  to try to save lives of these tiny innocent babies that are about to be  murdered, by their own mothers. &#160;I saw that he seemed to understand more than he  did before. I then said "good bye &amp; thanked him for being out here praying.&#160;  He said that everyone should do something &amp; I agreed.&#160;&#160;&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I went back into the center &amp; then the doorbell  rang.&#160; It was Valerie, one of our clients.&#160; She was nice enough to stay to help  Paul, once he arrived to put the things away into the Material Aid Room.&#160; She  also received some nice things for her 4&#160;children too.&#160; Tim stayed only briefly  but was helpful.&#160; He took the papers to made a revised copy,&#160;of our  application&#160;for our new volunteers, then he had to leave.&#160; Thanks Tim.&#160; At the  end of the day most of what was in the Great Room was put away.&#160; Thanks Paul  &amp; Valerie.&#160; We had still some cookies out on the table with some drinks for  the clients that came into the Material Aid Room.&#160; We mad it as festive as we  could for Thanksgiving Day.&#160; I stayed late to continue to do catch up work in  the office.&#160; I had time today to make many copies of many things that I needed  to make copies of &amp; also I made up about 15 Truth packets &amp; got an order  ready to call in on Monday for our literature packets.&#160; I also want to do a  mailing campaign.&#160; I want to send the people who give to Planned Parenthood some  information on Planned Parenthood, to educate them.&#160; They have their 2010 annual  community report &amp; here it is:</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160; </strong></span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/rochester-syracuse/files/Rochester-Syracuse/PlannedParenthood2011ARfinal.pdf"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>http://www.plannedparenthood.org/rochester-syracuse/files/Rochester-Syracuse/PlannedParenthood2011ARfinal.pdf</strong></span></span></a></font><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>.&#160;</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> This makes me sick to my stomach.&#160; Just think the young girl Taylor Smith, is sitting on the steps  with her mother Bernie Todd Smith, &amp; smiling.&#160; I feed &amp; changed Taylor's diapers &amp; sang to her &amp;  her twin sister Morgan &amp; took good care of the twins for 3 years before I left.&#160; I am to&#160; find out that's she's been brain washed by her  mother, who is pro death &amp; has been involved with Planned Parenthood for so many years.&#160; That's the reason that I left her employment.

in front  of Planned Parenthood</strong></span></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>There was Martha, Kathy, Carole, Paul &amp; Pat our  great grandmother, our client Valerie &#160;&amp; myself there to work in the center  &amp; be out&#160;on the front lines.&#160; We started out with Martha, Carole,&#160;Kathy,  Valerie &amp; myself.&#160; We all worked in the center putting away the baby items  that we just received from Maria, which were high chairs, car seats &amp; a  bassinet, etc..&#160; Then we had some of Martha's homemade cinnamon bread &amp; I  make a quick sandwich &amp; wolfed it down.&#160; Then Carole &amp; Martha went out  on the front lines in the rain.&#160; While I was there for a few minutes, helping to  carry some of the signs out on the sidewalk, Rick Bartell, who works in this  death place waved at me while he drove into Planned Parenthood, as he always  does.&#160; He is so evil acting &amp; he&#160;has helped to kill children for many, many  years there, which is horrific to me.&#160; I think that his wife works there to  because in their Community Report which is there Annual Report of 2010 there is  another Bartel listed as a worker in there, it could be his wife or sister??&#160;  Whoever it is, it's so sad.&#160; After Martha &amp; Carole were settled with all  that they needed to witness the Truth out on the front lines I went back into  the center.&#160; I'll be truthful I was very tired for I do have&#160;Fibromyalgia &amp;  Chronic Fatigue, so I went into the office &amp; put my head down, for a few  minutes.&#160; Then I heard Valerie say "is Mary taking a nap"?&#160; I was feeling guilty  so I got up &amp; opened the door &amp; then started to work at the desk.&#160;Then  Kathy came into the office &amp; said that a client was there for a second  pregnancy test.&#160; I got up &amp; went into the hallway &amp; I saw two young  girls standing there.&#160; I talked with them for a few minutes &amp; I gave them a  Truth packet &amp; our brochure &amp; said to them if they needed our assistance  we will be there for them.&#160; I asked if they needed a pregnancy test &amp;&#160;the  one girl&#160;said that she already had one.&#160; I was told later by Martha&#160;that the  two&#160;girls&#160;had come out of Planned&#160; Parenthood &amp; the Death Escort, Barry  Swan, literately walked them across the street, then they must have seen our  sign &amp; came into Focus to see what we were all about.&#160; I only hope that she  was negative &amp; if she was positive that she will 'choose life' for her  precious baby &amp; that the packet that I gave&#160;her will help her to 'choose  life', for it's full with the Truth.&#160;

I said to the mother, when she came back into the room,&#160;that we had  clothes for her son to change into for I didn't want him to get sick.&#160; After the  test &amp; we talked&#160;for a few minutes &amp; she then&#160;went into the Material Aid  Room to get&#160;some dry clothes for her son to change into.&#160; I found out that  she&#160;knew Valerie.&#160; I saw that&#160;there was a couple of mothers in the Material Aid  Room getting clothes for their children.&#160; We were very busy.&#160;&#160;Then the phone  rang&#160;&amp; it was a woman who wanted to volunteer at Focus&#160;so I made an  appointment to interview her on Wednesday at 5pm.&#160; I hope that it will work out  for the sake of Focus for we are so busy.&#160; I hope that it will work out for her  to be with us &amp; that she can come on Mondays, to help out Rob on Mondays&#160;for  he's by himself &amp;&#160;he's&#160;out on the front lines too&#160;&amp;

in the rain we went out with one large sign &amp;  the literature box &amp; the mega phone.&#160; I  witnessed with the sign &amp; she took the mega phone &amp; spoke about Margaret  Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood &amp; also the writer of&#160; Amazing  Grace, that almost everyone knows.&#160; She witnessed that he was once a slave owner  &amp; then realized what he was doing &amp; repented &amp; then wrote the lyrics  to Amazing Grace.&#160; She rattled some of the people coming out.&#160; She also spoke  with one of the girls that came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; quickly  befriended her.&#160; She spoke with her &amp; I handed her a Truth packet.&#160; She was  at Planned Parenthood for a STD test.&#160; Pat spoke with her not&#160;to have sex before  marriage.&#160; Amen sister.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Then Martha returned.&#160; I saw that she drove passed  us when we were on the sidewalk.&#160; She went into the center &amp; Pat &amp; I  stayed out on the front lines for about 15 minutes more.&#160; Just then a young girl  came walking over to us in a huff.&#160; She came from our parking lot.&#160; She said  that not everyone is at Planned Parenthood for an abortion &amp; that the  picture that&#160;I was holding was .......well I'd rather not repeat what she said  for&#160;the sake of this baby that was mutilated by the abortionist at the request  of the mother.&#160; May this child &amp; all the children that were ripped to shreds  "rest in peace' in the arms of Jesus &amp; Mother Mary.&#160; I said to her not to  disrespect this baby in that way &amp; Pat lit into her like a match.&#160; She  walked back to the parking lot &amp; was heading towards the restaurant.&#160; I said  to her "you have a nice supper at&#160;Abyssnia's restaurant&#160;&amp; if you've had an  abortion in the past please repent.&#160; Pat was upset &amp; she kept talking to her  too as she entered the restaurant.&#160; I looked in the window &amp; I saw that she  was sitting by the window with a guy.&#160; Poor fellow :(&#160;&#160; Then Pat &amp; I went  back over to Planned Parenthood &amp; resumed what we were doing previously,  until &#160;the mega phone gave out, because of the rain &amp; dampness &amp; then we  went&#160;back into the center to be with Martha.&#160; I did holler out to her, while she  was in the restaurant,t not to disrespect the children that were murdered by  their mothers.&#160; I know that she heard me because Martha who was in the center in  the back room heard me .&#160;

He said that he was a 'survivor', for his mother was going to have an  abortion but decided to place him up for adoption instead.&#160; He was forever  grateful to her in making the 'life' choice.&#160; Abortion is NOT a choice, you just  don't do it under any circumstances.&#160; Parenting or adoption are the only 2  choices.&#160; You don't 'choose death' for someone, do you?&#160; Especially someone that  can't speak or run away or defend themselves &amp; did nothing wrong, to boot.&#160;  How immoral &amp; inhumane is that?&#160; I said to him that I was so happy to hear  this &amp; I too was glad that his mother did the 'right thing'.&#160; He walked away  very happy.&#160;

I spoke with them as  they were walking down the sidewalk.&#160; They couldn't look at the graphic pictures  that I was holding, which I understand.&#160; Later on when I was talking to Martha  she said that these girls came into Focus for a pregnancy test.&#160;&#160;

She was  still busy in the center, for before Suzanne arrived Martha counseled 4 young  girls &amp; did 2 pregnancy tests. &#160;Suzanne was running late but finally she did  arrive to take over &amp; then Martha joined me out on the front lines.&#160; When  she came out she insisted that I go into the center to eat my sandwich that Paul  just brought in.&#160; I said the I didn't want to leave her by herself knowing how  horrible it is but she said that Adolf was across the street&#160;&amp; that she  would be fine,&#160;for Bill had now gone home.&#160; I said "okay, I'll hurry back" then  left.&#160; When I was eating my roast beef sandwich from Arby's for Wendy's was  packed Paul said. &#160;I spent&#160;a little&#160;time talking with Suzanne to do some 'catch  up' with her.&#160;

she slumped down in the back seat.&#160; Then one  after another came out after having their precious baby killed.&#160; It was so  disgusting to say the least.&#160; One of the men, he was about 40 or older,&#160;came to  pick up his wife was so nasty to me.&#160; I called to him first &amp; maybe pricked  his conscious but I really don't think so.&#160; He was angry because he got caught  in doing such an evil against his very own child.&#160; How evil it is out here, it  just makes you want to cry.&#160; Sometimes the pain is so unbearable.&#160; It's so  horrible to be standing in front of a place that is killing people all day long,  by pulling their heads, arms &amp; legs off of their torso.&#160; The frustration is  that you can't do anything to get through to the people, to change their  minds,&#160;only God can if they let Him.&#160; We are out there for the women that are on  the so called 'fence' that are likely to be persuaded to change their minds,  mostly by seeing the graphic pictures that we have out there on the sidewalk,  not the stiff necked women with stony hearts that want their baby dead, at all  costs.&#160; The determined lot of men &amp; women who are their for one thing only  &amp; that is to abort their child.&#160; I say to them "that sex was not meant to  kill" &amp;&#160;"that you wanted the feel good feeling of sex but the not the person  that was conceived in that sexual act".&#160;

I usually stay out by  myself until 5pm.&#160; Adolf had gone too.&#160; I looked over at the parking lot &amp; I  saw that some young girls were walking out from the Administrator's entrance.&#160;  As the first car drove out &amp; bent down &amp; said to the two young girls  "girls, what are you doing".&#160; As they looked at me the both responded in unison  "smoking".&#160; Yes, that were starting to smoke,&#160;for they both were lighting up a  cigarette, in the car.&#160; The car pulled over to the curb to where I was standing  alone.&#160; Then the driver said to me "stop hollering, for we were here for rape  counseling".&#160; I said back to them that I also was raped &amp; that I wouldn't go  to them for anything.&#160; The driver replied that her rapist was going to  jail.&#160;&#160;That was a good thing.&#160; She then said to me again to stop hollering.&#160; As  they were driving away from me I called to them saying&#160;"you survived they  didn't", meaning the babies that were killed here by abortion.&#160;&#160;I could hear  them screaming something back to me &amp; it wasn't nice.&#160;I wondered if they or  one of them was post abortive. &#160;Which is worst: abortion or rape?&#160; Please don't  say both, for rape it really bad but you survived.&#160; I know that it is a life  long process to be healed but at least it wasn't your fault &amp; you are  alive.&#160; With abortion it is your fault &amp; the baby is dead!!!&#160; I'm not  heartless but realistic.......</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I went into the center to do some work there &amp;

I will met up with her later.  &#160;Then the landlord Bernie came to get the rent check &amp; to talk to me about  the Great Room being colder then the rest of the center, for Martha had called  him, on the phone, about this earlier on. &#160;He suggested for us to&#160;buy a space  heater &amp; I said "why don't you get it for us" &amp; he finally agreed to get  us one.&#160; Thanks Bernie, Martha will also be pleased. After he left with his  friend Moses I went into the office to revise the Intake Sheet, for the  pregnancy tests.&#160; Earlier I had asked Suzanne to add on the sheet a line that  asked the client if she had ever encountered sexual abuse of any kind.&#160; Suzanne  wanted to add on the sheet how did the client find out about Focus. Suzanne had  put this information on the revised Intake Sheet but I wanted to change the  wording&#160;a bit.&#160; I stayed &amp; completed this job &amp; then I meet up with  Martha at St. Jude's Church for Holy Hour.&#160; God is&#160;&#160; Great!!&#160; He is  so offended by our sins against Him.

C. had burned for us,&#160;I'll come back &amp; join you on the front lines &amp;  in the meantime there is Kathy (before she quit at the end of the day) &amp;  Paul working in the center."&#160; She replied that that would be fine.&#160; So off I go  to the Key Bank, in Irondequoit, to&#160;deposit a check, so that we would have some  money in the account&#160;&amp; to pick up the materials that Fr. C. had for Focus. I  was doing my errands, which was the first time that I had left to do so,&#160;at the  time that I'm at the center &amp;&#160;on the front lines.&#160; I don't make a habit of  it.&#160; Well I went to the rectory to pick up the box of CD's &amp; DVD's that Fr.  had left on the porch &amp; went into the church for a few minutes to say "hi"  to the Lord &amp; Mother Mary &amp; the Saints &amp; then&#160;I went down the street  to the bank to make the deposit.&#160; As I was leaving the parking lot the car next  to me was honking as we were waiting for the light to change.&#160; I paid him no  attention &amp; then at the&#160;next light he beeped again &amp; showed me his IQ,  the #1 gesture of disrespect.&#160; The only thing that I saw that I&#160;had that he  could see in his car was the Rosary that I had on my car mirror, poor fellow, I  said some prayers for him on my way back to the center.&#160;&#160;Lord have  Mercy!!</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When I arrived back to the center I got out on my  car &amp; walked over to Martha &amp; Carole who were still on the front lines.&#160;  They looked fine but I know that anything could happen at any time out there  &amp; I asked them if anything had happened to them while was I was gone.&#160; Well,  this is what they said.&#160; Oh yea this is what happened to us while you were gone  Mary.&#160; A&#160; car stopped in the middle of the street &amp; a man got out of his car  &amp; started to ramp &amp; rave about what we were doing out there.&#160; His eyes  were rolling in the back of his head &amp; he was spitting too.&#160; He was swearing  &amp; cursing, even at the picture of Jesus holding an aborted baby &amp;&#160;He was  crying, that Martha was holding in her hands.&#160; It was awful.&#160; Then she went on  to say that Carole had dropped her glove on the ground &amp; he walked over to  pick it up for her &amp; then he became more calm.&#160; Martha said that she then  asked him a question which was "has anyone in your family ever had an abortion",  to which he&#160;replied that his ex girlfriend, the mother of&#160;his son, had an  abortion after she was raped at&#160;RIT at a party.&#160; This was the problem we  thought, maybe he paid for it &amp; even drove her there to have the abortion,  &amp; now he&#160; deeply regrets it but can't express his grief in an normal &amp;  healthy&#160;way.&#160; He then said that he had to go now to pick up his son from  school.&#160;Lord have Mercy on him, I hope that he finds peace real soon for his sake &amp; for his son's sake too!!</span></span></strong></div></div></div></div></div><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></p><hr /><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wednesday, December 12, 2011 at Focus for Randall  Terry's son&#160;Funeral Reception</span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What a day I had today!!!&#160; Martha too.&#160; Martha had  to go for a procedure this morning at 7:30am &amp; they were going to put her  out to do it.&#160; A tube down her stomach which is an Endoscopy.&#160; But this was the  day that Randall Terry&#160;&amp; his family &amp; friends were coming to Focus after  the Funeral Mass for his son that was killed in Georgia last week in a car  accident.&#160; We told them all to come to Focus for the Funeral Reception after the  burial here in Rochester.&#160; Randall &amp; family live in Virginia but his father  is buried here &amp; his mother still lives here.&#160; Martha had scheduled her  procedure way before this tragedy so there was a conflict.&#160; Martha&#160;had it all  planned though.&#160; She made a pot of chili &amp; a cake to bring to the center in  the afternoon&#160;after she recovered.&#160; She ordered small subs from the Deli to be  delivered around 4pm today.&#160; I had brought in a cake &amp; brownies, a veggie  tray, cheese &amp;&#160;crackers, humus &amp; salsa&#160;for the tortilla chips &amp; a  bag of potato chips for the sandwiches.&#160; I knew that we were going to have a new  recruit come in today &amp; his name is Pastor Everett, for he called me  yesterday,&#160;&amp; the 4 Elim Bible Institute students, which was their last day  today&#160;until them come back to us in January 2012, to help me&#160;to set up the  tables &amp; chairs in the Green Room, so I wasn't to worried.&#160; Around 1:30pm I  called Martha to see how she was doing &amp; I woke her up.&#160; She said that she  would call me later on &amp; she did to tell me that she was on her way, her ex  husband was bringing her to Focus &amp;

I had already called Sheila who I replace that I would  be there, on the front lines, around 1:10 &amp; she has to go at 1pm, so I said  that if I wasn't there at 1pm then just go.&#160; When I arrived I saw that Paul was  bringing the signs into the center &amp; I said "no Paul, I'm here now so please  bring everything back outside", which he did.&#160; Sheila was gone for it was about  1:12pm when I arrived.&#160; I knew that Martha was soon to arrive because we sat  together at the Mass.&#160; I ran out of church after the Mass leaving Martha to  arrive when she could. &#160;Bill, was sitting across the street with the sign &amp;  myself.&#160; I looked over from the fence &amp; saw that a young girl, was sitting  on the bench, by the door smoking.&#160; I called over to her &amp; pleaded that she  goes back in there to save her friend or sister &amp; her baby.&#160; She was as cold  a ice.&#160; No reaction at all.&#160; I see dead people.&#160; I said to her that if she had  brought someone in here to have her precious baby killed that it will also  effect her to &amp; also the person that she brought in here today.&#160;&#160;I said to  her,&#160;that this would make her an accessory to murder.&#160; She coldly walked back  into Planned Parenthood, after her smoke, to rejoin the girl that she brought  here today.&#160; So disturbing &amp; so sad.&#160; It was 10 minutes later that Martha  &amp; Adolf arrived to join Bill &amp; I as a team.&#160; It was one event after  another &amp; it's sometimes just to painful to write about.&#160; It's so evil &amp;  horrible to say the least.&#160; I was calling out to the girls giving them  information that they have never heard before &amp; as I was finishing I heard a  female voice call out saying "it's not a baby".&#160; I said "if it's not a baby then  you weren't pregnant".&#160; She looked shocked &amp; her boyfriend, as he passed by  me on the sidewalk he looked at me with his evil eyes &amp; waved mockingly at  me.&#160; Your nightmare has just began.&#160; </span></span></strong></p><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium">A  car had pulled into the parking lot &amp; two young girls were in the car.&#160; It  was later in the day so I didn't think that they were here for an abortion, but  you can't be 100% sure thus take no chances.&#160; As the girls were getting out of  the car I started to talk to them of what is going on in there.&#160; The driver of  the car&#160;who was&#160;the girl closet to where Martha &amp; I were standing said "I'm  going to call the police you&#160; (blank blank)" as she was giving us her&#160;middle  finger.&#160; I said back to her "we're not doing anything wrong &amp; we do have a  right of Freedom of Speech too".&#160; Then she said that she was here because she  had been raped in the past.&#160; I said quickly to her that I am also a rape  survivor &amp; that we were sisters &amp; that I wouldn't go here for anything  &amp; that she deserved better &amp; one more thing, they don't report statutory  rape thus protecting the rapist thus the minor will probably be raped again.&#160;  Then they were in the building but at least I said what I said to them.&#160; I  waited until they came out about an hour &amp; a half later by this time Martha  was in the center &amp; I was alone on the front lines.&#160; I tried to talk to her  again &amp; I hope that&#160;I made an impression on her.&#160; I said to her that God  cried when this happened to her &amp; that it was the 'free will' of the rapist  to hurt her &amp;

Martha said "go ahead &amp; take our pictures" &amp; the girl replied  that it wasn't a camera but a video camera.&#160; I held up the graphic sign so that  she could take the picture of this baby that lost his or her life from  abortion.&#160; She then went back into the parking lot.&#160; Martha a went into the  center &amp; was gone when she&#160; came back&#160;a few minutes later.&#160;She said to me  "can I ask you some questions"?&#160; I said "yes".&#160; She then said "what if the girl  is young &amp; she's pregnant &amp; she has no money".&#160; I said "you don't kill  someone because you're poor otherwise a lot of us would be dead.&#160; She can go to  get assistance form Social Services &amp; the churches &amp; the agencies in the  community &amp; the pregnancy center &amp; we have one right down the street her  &amp; we provide free baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; I said to her&#160;"then why  don't you go home &amp; kill your 2 year old because he or she can't do things  like make their own supper, bath &amp; dress themselves,&#160;or talk using clear  &amp; definitive sentences.&#160; You get the drift".&#160; I don't know if she had a 2  year old &amp; I greatly doubt it for <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">it was only an allegory &amp;

At  the end of the meal I went into the office where I now hid the cake &amp; put  the yellow candle on the chocolate cake &amp; brought tit out singing Happy  Birthday to Martha's surprise &amp; to the other peoples surprise too.&#160; I only  lit a few candles for I didn't want to start a fire in the office.&#160; Pat lit the  rest of the candles after we all sang Happy Birthday &amp; Martha made a wish  &amp; then blew out the candles all by herself.&#160;

She told me that she had baked some sugar coolies &amp;  after lunch we set up the table, in the Green Room,&#160;with cookies &amp;  strawberry/ banana punch, for our clients &amp; their children, to enjoy.&#160;  Martha also put some cheddar cheese Goldfish crackers&#160;into small cups especially  for the kids.&#160; It was a nice festive Christmas time table.&#160;</font></strong></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">Martha &amp; I  stayed in the center, all afternoon taking care of our many mothers,&#160;who&#160;came to  receive many nice things for their children, it being clothes, toys, books &amp;  small items, etc..&#160; I received a phone call from one of our clients that is  pregnant with baby #2.&#160; She left her abusive boyfriend who is in jail now, thank  God, &amp; she has a two year old daughter &amp; they need a place to stay at  for the next two weeks until her apartment is ready for them&#160;through the  Department of Social Services.&#160; They have been living in a cheap hotel on  Chestnut St. called the Cadmic Hotel a very bad place for a woman to be at let  along a pregnant one with a child.&#160; When she called me I asked her to try to get  to Focus &amp; I'd see what I could do for her &amp; her daughter.&#160; She said  "okay that she will try" &amp; she hung up.&#160; Poor baby!!&#160; Just then the doorbell  rang &amp; it was Pat our grandmother &amp; great grandmother of 8.&#160; She came to  talk to Pastor Everett this afternoon.&#160; I told her that I received a call from  him saying that he had just brought his wife home from the hospital today &amp;  that when&#160;you come to Focus,&#160;for me to call him &amp; he'd try to get away to  stop over to speak to you.&#160; So that's what I did when Pat arrived, I called  Pastor Everett, &amp; he came over to meet &amp; talk with Pat, regarding the  pro life issues, of the Afro American community.&#160;&#160;He will get more people &amp;  they will protest Planned Parenthood next Wednesday.&#160; Yeah...finally some Black  representation out on the front lines in front of the racist Planned  Parenthood.&#160;

She was on the phone when Pat said that she  could stay with her &amp; the family for 2 weeks until she gets her apartment.&#160;  She called her family &amp; they said "yes" to the idea.&#160; So awhile later after  they both went into the Material Aid Room to get some things for their children  drove to Pat's house all together.&#160; (Unfortunately it didn't work out &amp; our  client did end up with a family from R.A.I.H.N, but that's okay as long as her &amp;  her child are safe &amp; are cared for.&#160; It really did work out in the end for everyone).&#160;</font></strong></span></div></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Thursday, December, 15, in front of Planned  Parenthood</strong></span></span></span></p><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I hurried to the bank before I arrived on the front  lines today.&#160; I was there at 1pm but I wanted to get their earlier to put some  of the things that I had in my car.&#160; Martha was already there for I called her  earlier &amp; told her that I was running late today &amp; that I needed her to  be there at 1pm, if she could,&#160;in case I'm not.&#160; She always comes through for me  &amp; she's a&#160;great partner as Rob is, he's a&#160;sidewalk counselor,&#160; for we  started together 16 years ago,&#160;on the front lines in front of Planned  Parenthood.&#160; I ran into Paul &amp; asked him if he could get Martha &amp; I a  sandwich from Wendy's, which he did, &amp; he also gave Focus a generous  donation towards our work.&#160;Thanks Paul.&#160; I was just heading out when Sheila came  into the center &amp; told me that she did 2 pregnancy tests today.&#160; One  positive ( she wasn't abortion minded) &amp; one negative (she is post abortive  &amp; would never do it again).&#160; She also told me that she spoke with a husband  &amp; wife&#160;earlier this afternoon.&#160; As they were leaving Planned Parenthood&#160;they  stopped the car to where she was standing &amp; asked why she was there.&#160; She  told them that she&#160;was here to save babies from being aborted.&#160; Then she asked  the woman if she had an abortion &amp; she replied that she just did.&#160; She said  that her &amp; her husband had 3 children &amp; talked it over &amp; decided  that three children were enough, so she was here for the abortion.&#160; She asked  "what is that" &amp; pointed to a Rosary.&#160; Sheila said that it was a Rosary  &amp; she went over to the car&#160;to give her one saying "here is the directions to  pray it &amp; to ask God to forgive you for having your baby killed here  today".&#160;&#160;The woman took the Rosary &amp;&#160;said that&#160;she had to go to work &amp;  then they&#160;drove away.&#160; How sick!!&#160; How evil!!&#160; Their poor children, for they  will miss their brother or sister, that was murdered here today, for&#160;not being  in their lives. The parents will have to tell them someday what they did here  today at Planned Parenthood, for the children will already know.&#160; Families are  being destroyed by abortion &amp; divorce.&#160; When Sheila told me this I felt sick  to my stomach.&#160;

that  her brother Dennis was there today visiting from Texas.&#160; He is a wonderful man  &amp; I am blessed to have met him &amp; his sister, Sheila.&#160; I quickly went to  the car &amp; peeped in to say "hi", for I haven't seen him since this summer  when he was visiting for a while &amp; then went back to Texas.&#160; He smiled at me  &amp; said "hi" back.&#160; Sheila said that all 6 Truth packets were given out by  her brother, for she was in the center most of the time, doing pregnancy tests.&#160;  Great job Dennis!!&#160; I said "good bye to them both &amp; left to join Martha on  the front lines along with Carole, Bill, Dan &amp; Adolf.&#160; When Paul returned to  the center he stayed in there to do work in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Suzanne, our  Client Advocate,&#160;called to tell me that she was running late &amp; that she will  be there around 2pm instead 1:30pm.&#160; Okay.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>It was a rainy &amp; windy day, out on the front  lines, which I think is the hardest to deal with.&#160; I'd rather deal with snow  than the wind &amp; rain.&#160; Martha's umbrella broke because&#160;it was so windy &amp;  the signs are hard to control too.&#160; But we always manage to continue our  ministry, never the less.&#160; Then I looked up the sidewalk to see that Pat our  great grand mother was walking towards us.&#160; I was so happy to have her there,  for she &amp; Pastor Everett were planning to come next Wednesday.&#160; She said  that she wanted to start now so I gave her the mega phone &amp; off she went  giving the message of life from her heart.&#160; It was so strong a message that Rick  Bartell, the Public Relations&#160;wimp,&#160;from Planned Parenthood, came out to see  what was going on out on the sidewalk.&#160; Pat saw him &amp; asked for him to come  over to speak with her , which he declined to do.&#160; He went back into the hell  hole Planned Parenthood with a smirk on his face.&#160; Pat called him on&#160;him giving  a smirk &amp; she was angry, to say the least.&#160; Then the Death Escort, Barry  Swan, came to get the girls to go into Planned Parenthood.&#160; He puts on a blue  apron which reads PLANNED PARENTHOOD &amp; he approaches the cars, when they  drive in&#160;&amp; then when the girl or girls&#160;get out of the car they follow him  into the 'death mill' to have their precious baby be killed.&#160; He's a Vulture.&#160; I  scold the girls telling them that they have no boundaries, to talk to &amp; to  follow a man that you don't know, into a&#160;facility is&#160;unwise.&#160;He appeared a  little puzzled by Pat &amp; he walked out on the&#160;sidewalk to see what was going  on out there.&#160; He saw Pat &amp; Pat saw him &amp; she had a few words for him  too.&#160; When he went back, he walked into Planned Parenthood, to probably notify  Bartell who had already been out there, of the commotion.&#160; She didn't mince  words for she know all to well that Planned Parenthood is committing Black  Genocide on her Race.&#160; She's not going to take it.&#160; She talked to the girls  walking down the&#160;sidewalk &amp; to those who were coming out of Planned  Parenthood too &amp; gave them a Truth packet.&#160; Her voice rings louder than ours  because we're not Black.&#160; After a good hour or&#160;so&#160;Pat had to leave &amp; at that  time the cars, with the girls in it&#160;that had just killed their baby, were  leaving, which is soooo very&#160;difficult for us to see.&#160; She said "good bye" &amp;  we said "thank you &amp; good bye" back to her &amp; we told her that she did a  great job here today&#160;too.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A car pulled into Planned Parenthood &amp; I  hollered to them "please don't kill your baby" &amp; she hollered back "I'm  not".&#160; Then Martha, who saw that there was a young child in the back seat of the  car saying "we have free diapers".&#160; Then the woman hollered back "I'll be right  over when I come out".&#160; When they came out I told them to follow me &amp; I&#160;lead  them to the Focus Center.&#160; I quickly went to the front door &amp; rang the bell  hoping that Suzanne would answer it but it was Paul instead.&#160; I went down the  hall to the office where Suzanne was &amp; told her that&#160;I had just brought  in&#160;two&#160;young girls &amp; a child ,for diapers, that were just at Planned  Parenthood.&#160; She got up from her chair &amp; greeted them at the door.&#160; Later I  found out that she was also given a pregnancy test which was positive &amp; she  wasn't abortion minded either, thank God.&#160; So we were able to help&#160;her in  a&#160;couple of ways today &amp; to get her away from Planned Parenthood too.&#160;  Praise God!!&#160; &#160;&#160;

I wished her a Happy Birthday, for Martha is 70 today, but a young  70.&#160; I asked Paul at church if he could help us at the center today &amp; he  said "yes" but first he was going to Nick Tahou's for lunch.&#160; I asked&#160;Paul  if&#160;he&#160;could please get me a hamburger &amp; macaroni salad &amp; Martha a  chicken sandwich &amp; French fries, I would pay for both of the meals when he  gets to&#160;Focus.&#160; He agreed.&#160; When I drove in the parking lot one of our clients  was there already &amp; she came expecting a Christmas present for her son, who  lives with the father due to her past.&#160; Most of the cases with our girls are  heartbreaking.&#160; We just try to make a difference through Christ who changes them  with love from Him &amp; from us.&#160; After that it was so busy once more.&#160; I sat  up the table with cookies &amp; punch.&#160; It was so nice &amp; the girls &amp;  their children like it too.&#160; I'm thinking of doing this more often even&#160;after  Christmas.&#160; It's no big deal to get the punch &amp; the cookies &amp; set up the  table in the Green Room.&#160; It's more time that we can spend with our girls to get  to know them &amp; they us, so that we can better serve them&#160;with their needs  for their families.&#160;

it was Martha's daughter  &amp; her son in law, Aaron who is Black.&#160; His son, from a previous  marriage,&#160;was shot to death&#160;this past summer &amp; they haven't found the killer  yet but the police know what happened.&#160; They came to wish Martha a Happy  Birthday &amp; to help out in the center.&#160; Then Paul came in with the food &amp;  I ate my lunch &amp; Martha waited a little longer for she was busy putting away  children's clothes along with her daughter.&#160; Aaron sat in the Green Room talking  to me while I was eating my lunch &amp; then the doorbell rang &amp; it was  Pastor Everett &amp; another Black pastor.&#160; I was so glad to see them, for they  set up this day &amp; time last week, along with Pat to come to Focus &amp; then  to be in front of Planned Parenthood to protest them killing the Black babies  &amp; the White babies there.&#160; I called over to see where Pat was &amp; I was  told by Erica, her granddaughter that she was on her way to Focus.&#160; A few  minutes later there she was, for she had arrived to the center.&#160; I greeted her  at the door &amp; she was glad to know that Pastor Everett was there along with  another Black pastor.&#160; The meeting started &amp; Aaron got involved to what he  was hearing &amp; I gave him the DVD of Maafia :21 Black Genocide in the 21st.  Century.&#160;&#160; This was the DVD that changed Pastor Everett, for he had no idea that  this racism was going on at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said that Planned Parenthood  was scared of you all.&#160; So they got up &amp; went out to the front lines, in  front of Planned&#160;Parenthood, &#160;with literature packets, graphic signs &amp; the  mega phone.&#160; Before they left we agreed that this ministry will be based on  Prayer, Education &amp; Protest.&#160; Prayer &amp; Action is what the Bible  teaches.&#160; They also stated that they will lead their congregation in a  knowledgeable session about Planned Parenthood &amp; then march to Planned  Parenthood after that.&#160; I said that Martha &amp; I wanted to be a part of that  event!!&#160;&#160; Just then the Landlord Bernie came in to give Martha &amp; I a big  plate of cookies all wrapped up looking beautiful.&#160; He just starred at the group  meeting that was going on.&#160; He is married to a Black woman &amp; he is  White&#160;too.&#160; He's not a believe in the Lord or at least he tells us that but his  wife is a Baptist.&#160; I once asked him how this works out with them &amp; he  replied that they don't talk about religion &amp; politics.&#160; How boring!!&#160; I'm  praying&#160;for his conversion &amp; for him to know &amp; love the Lord &amp; to  have&#160;Him in his life too.&#160; I thanked him for the cookies &amp; handed him a  bottle of Sweet Walter white &amp; a card form both Martha &amp; I to him &amp;  his wife.&#160; He thanked me &amp; I said&#160;"we love you Bernie".&#160; I hope that he  takes this right.&#160; &#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>While the trio was out on the front lines giving  all they got to help &amp;

I  wrote a Christmas 'Thank You' card for them at St. Pius X church, for they bless  us many times, of the year.&#160; Thank you Lord for the food.&#160; It was a few minutes  later that the doorbell rang again &amp; it was Andrea, from Archangel School,  dropping off bags of children clothes &amp; diapers for us at Focus for our  moms.&#160; Thanks you all at the school &amp; the parents.&#160; I will write a 'Thank  You' letter very soon for your generosity &amp; may God bless you all for your  goodness to us.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was Martha's other daughter coming  to say "hi" before she went to work.&#160; How&#160;nice was this for Martha!!!&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A few minutes later the trio came in &amp;

 her granddaughter were treated, in the Emergency Room, a couple of months ago.&#160;  She will sent the letter Certified Mail.&#160; She stayed awhile to talk &amp; to get  some things for her great grandchildren to take with her.&#160;

that she will suffer the  consequences of this violence against her child, for the rest of her life, &amp;  those who were involved with this murder too.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>When I arrived at the center their was a mother  already there ringing the doorbell, wanting clothes for her child, yes we do  open from 1pm until 6pm so I needed to address this first.&#160; I called down the  sidewalk to tell Sheila that I was here &amp; waved to her &amp; then went into  the center with our client to open up the door to the Material Aid Room, for her  to start getting the things that she needed.&#160; She was thankful.&#160; Just then a  mother &amp; father &amp; a young child, in a stroller, arrived to get some  things in the Material Aid Room too.&#160; I was frustrated for I was hoping that  Martha would be coming very soon to help me, I depend on her so much.&#160; She  didn't arrive until 1:40pm &amp; she&#160;had to stay in the center for it was very  busy &amp; I had to stay out on the front lines, with Adolf &amp; Bill &amp; Dan  (Jacobs) arrived to help me too, thank God.&#160; Martha, said to me later on that  she&#160;had to go to the doctors early in the morning to get some treatment for her  sinus &amp; respiratory problems that she's been suffering with all week &amp;  then had to go to the drug store to pick up a prescription&#160;&amp; then she went  to pick up the knitted blankets, for the center,&#160;from a house bound woman that  had blessed Focus with them.&#160; When I came out to the front lines I noticed that  Sheila &amp; her brother&#160;had gone &amp; I had a Christmas card for them too.&#160; I  started out already very upset, on the front lines.&#160; Sheila had called me twice  this morning asking me questions about a young pregnant&#160;girl &amp; her mother  regarding more assistance for them.&#160;&#160;I suggested that Sheila call&#160;at Compass  Care,&#160;to set up an ultrasound for the pregnant young girl.&#160; She made an  appointment for 2pm today.&#160; The pregnant young woman &amp; her mother&#160;were at  Planned Parenthood, this morning,&#160;to get set up with health&#160;insurance.&#160;&#160;The  young girl&#160;made an appointment to come back to Planned Parenthood, before she  met Sheila,&#160;for 2pm on Tuesday.&#160; Sheila asked her not to come back.&#160; I  suggested, over the phone, to call&#160; Fidelis Care, which they did.&#160; Sheila  brought them into the center to make these calls &amp; thank God she wasn't  abortion minded &amp; Sheila had her make out an Intake Sheet,&#160;at the Focus  Center,&#160;so that we can follow her through her pregnancy until birth &amp; even  afterwards.The mom &amp; her were scared but Sheila said that we could help them  &amp; they were confronted.&#160; Great job Sheila!&#160; Suzanne, our Thursday Client  Advocate,&#160;will call her to see how she's doing next week.&#160; We are here for her  &amp; her mother.&#160; Everything will work out just fine, just trust in  God.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Sheila told me earlier,on the phone, that Planned  Parenthood was busy while she was there from 10:30am until 1pm.&#160; This was very  upsetting&#160;for me. I try to get there earlier, on the front lines, which is next  to impossible for me, for whatever reason.&#160; Maybe, subconsciously I don't want  to be&#160;there, but I know that I must be there, to try to save lives form being  killed by abortion.&#160;

I called over to her  to offer her free children clothes at the Focus Center but I got no response.&#160;  She then crossed the street, with her daughter, &amp; was walking&#160;towards  Planned Parenthood.&#160; I asked her if she was going into Planned Parenthood &amp;  she said "yes I am".&#160; I was sad to hear this &amp; to see that she was going in  there&#160;with her daughter too.&#160; When she came out about an hour later she walked  over to me &amp; was very defensive.&#160; Se was upset that I spoke about God &amp;  the devil.&#160; She was upset that her daughter was now asking questions &amp; I  told her that she must now answer them.&#160; She said that she was here for a  physical.&#160;I told her that she , by being here keeps the doors open for Planned  Parenthood to kill innocent children. &#160;I offered her our doctor list but she  said refused the offer.&#160; Why?&#160; I was getting no where with her so I said "good  bye".&#160; When she walked away Dan took over &amp; spoke with her for about 5  minutes which I was happy about.&#160; I asked him, after she left&#160; what he said to  her.&#160; He said that she spoke with her about the racist founder of Planned  Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, &amp;&#160;for her to look her up on the Internet.&#160;  Thank you Lord for sending Dan her today.&#160;&#160;&#160;I was nervous that I had left the  mothers in the center without any supervision&#160;so I asked Adolf if he would go  into the Material Aid Room to see how things were going on.&#160;

he aid "yes" &amp; he  did.&#160; Thanks Dan.&#160; what a help.&#160; The man as he drove passed me about 10 minutes  later honked at me waving.&#160; I was happy that we were able to&#160;assist him in his  needs, for that's what it's all about.&#160;

lit into&#160;me like a match.&#160; She was screaming at  me&#160;&amp; she reaching over to the passenger side of the car &amp; I thought that  she was going to go through the window &amp; come out onto the sidewalk &amp;  take a hit at me.&#160; &#160;I knew that I was going no where with her.&#160; I started to  pray the 'Hail Mary' prayer&#160;&amp; then I looked at the back of her car &amp;  she&#160;said "go ahead take down my tag number I don't&#160;care".&#160; I then told her to  calm down for the sake of the children she had in the back seat so that nothing  would happen to them.&#160; She then called me a&#160;some very bad names, in front of the  children, who were in the back seat of the car.&#160; "Goodbye" I said &amp; thank  God she&#160;finally did leave.&#160; But&#160;sadly enough she came&#160;back to Planned  Parenthood&#160;later on&#160; but thank God without the children.&#160; She had probably  dropped off someone there to have an abortion &amp; was upset when she saw the  graphic signs out there on the front lines.&#160; Too bad!!&#160;&#160; Planned Parenthood  is&#160;murdering innocent people&#160;&amp; you all are angry at us for exposing their  evil .&#160;

all ready to go home e to recoup after the killing  of your baby".&#160; She came out ours later with her so called girlfriend with her  head back in the passenger side of the car.&#160; I&#160;said that they were both  responsible&#160;for the murdering of an&#160;innocent human being.&#160;

When I arrived at the center I saw that a car was driving  into&#160;Planned Parenthood's driveway &amp; also I saw that a young girl was on her  cell phone walking on the sidewalk near the Killing Mill.&#160; I got out of the car  &amp; walked over to Planned Parenthood &amp; called out the Truth about&#160;this  evil place,&#160;by the fence.&#160; I called to the young girl, who was on the phone, to  come over to where I was standing, &amp; she came right over to me.&#160; She heard  what I said about abortion being murder &amp; she agreed.&#160; I then asked her if  she needed anything at our pregnancy center two doors down the street &amp; she  said that her sister was pregnant &amp; that she would like to see the center.&#160;  I was overjoyed when I heard her say this,&#160;to say the least.&#160; We walked over to  Focus &amp; I introduced myself to her as the director of the Focus Center &amp;  I lead her into the Material Aid Room.&#160; When she saw the room her eyes lit up.&#160;  I was happy to see that.&#160; I asked her to sign in the book&#160;&amp; she did.&#160; I gave  her a plastic bag to get some things for her sister &amp; then I went to the  Rose Room to get her a DVD, of the Growth &amp; Development of the baby in the  womb &amp; a list of good doctors &amp; our Truth packet with the 10 week  old&#160;baby model in it.&#160; She was overjoyed to receive all of this information for  her sister.&#160; I gave her a book on Pregnancy month to month &amp; what to  expect.&#160; She was happy about that too.&#160; She said that she wanted her sister to  come into Focus when she finds out if she's having a boy or a girl, to get some  things for the baby.&#160; I said "thank you for being so open to the Truth &amp; to  keep away from the racist Planned Parenthood for your exams &amp; to call one of  the doctors on the list that I just gave you, you'll be happier about doing the  right thing".&#160; It's better to&#160;have a doctor take care of you&#160;that's not an  abortionist.&#160; You deserve that.&#160; She smiled &amp; said "thank you" &amp; I  reached over to get her our brochure &amp; I handed it to her &amp;&#160; said "thank  you for being so open to the Truth &amp; have a blessed day, my dear".&#160; I added  "I hope to see you again real soon here at Focus".&#160;&#160;&#160; She said "yes you will".  &#160;Off&#160;she went a much happier person than when she went into Planned Parenthood  to get her exam.&#160;

Paul answered&#160;the door&#160;&amp; it was Dan, from the Knights of  Columbus &amp; his wife &amp; son.&#160; They were dropping off bags of&#160;clothes &amp;  diapers,&#160;from the Knights, for our moms.&#160; Paul was asked to take our picture on  Dan's cell phone so that he could out it into put in the Knights Newsletter.&#160;  Three strikes you're out &amp; that's how many times I had to stand there &amp;  smile.&#160; I hate my picture taken but I'll do it for the cause.&#160; Dan's son needed  a project for his 'Eagle Scout Project'.&#160; We all were looking around all the  rooms in the center,&#160;to see what it would be.&#160; The decision was to build a large  food cupboard enclosed, that will be in the&#160;Great Room so that we can put our  non perishable foods in&#160;it &amp; it'll be hidden.&#160; It will look great &amp; it  will look like furniture, rather than&#160;exposed food shelves, that it does right  now.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I can't wait to see it &amp; have it in the Great Room too.&#160;  Thanks Lord for this wonderful surprise!!&#160; The had to go to lunch &amp; I said  "thank you &amp; please keep in touch".&#160; Before they left I had two more  surprises.&#160; One was that McQuaid High School was doing a diaper drive for Focus  so that will be a blessing &amp; it'll save Focus some money, that's for sure.&#160;  Another was that Dan's wife asked if I would speak at her church in May to tell  them about Focus &amp; what we do here &amp; on the front lines.&#160; I will be  honored I said back to her &amp; I'll bring Martha too.&#160; She said "that will be  great &amp; thank you so much".&#160; I said "no problem &amp; I thank you for  asking".&#160; Off they went to go to lunch, what a blessing this was.&#160;

I brought them into the Rose Room for testing.&#160; A  friend recommended them to Focus.&#160; I noticed that she had a blank look on her  face &amp; when I asked her to fill out the Intake Sheet the first thing she  asked was "are you going to tell my parent's"?&#160; I replied "no".&#160; After the  negative test I talked to her about abstinence &amp; gave her&#160;two CD's, on  chastity,&#160;&amp; lots of brochures &amp; the Truth packet too.&#160; I asked her if  she had a Bible &amp; if she knew the Lord.&#160; She said that she is Catholic.&#160; I  asked to her to go to Confession &amp; to start over now with God's help.&#160; She  never smiled.</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I talked with a mother who is raising her  grandchildren &amp; came in for lots of clothes &amp; toys for them.&#160; She is a  regular but needs our support.&#160; Another two woman came in from an agency of  disabled person's &amp; she thanked me for having this center to provide  the&#160;many items that we give out plus food.&#160; I gave her our brochure too.&#160; Very  pleasant lady.&#160;&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the&#160;doorbell rang &amp; it was Pat &amp; she  was ready to go out to the front lines to protest.&#160; I called Pastor Everett  &amp; asked him if he was planning to come today.&#160; He said that was in court all  day &amp; that he&#160;was planning to come tomorrow.&#160; I told Pat this &amp; she went  alone out&#160;to the front lines after I gave her the mega phone &amp; the&#160;signs  &amp; the literature box.&#160; I went into the center to do more work there but was  uncomfortable leaving Pat alone out on the front lines by herself.&#160; So I got my  coat on &amp; went out to join her in the rain with two umbrellas.&#160; When I  arrived she was talking to a man who had his girlfriend in there being  treated&#160;for Chlamydia.&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Check out:&#160;

 I gave him some information to give to her &amp; asked him never to bring  her&#160;here again.&#160; Pat&#160;had already given him a Truth packet.&#160; We need to get these  people the right help at the right place &amp; to get them away from this  Killing Mill, Planned&#160;Parenthood,&#160;where they are lied to &amp; deceived.&#160;&#160;He was  open to the Truth, now I hope that his girlfriend was too.&#160; Bottom line is that  Planned Parenthood Kills Children !!!!!!!!!!!!&#160;

when she  returned she told me that there was a woman who wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I  asked her if she would be okay out here by herself while I went into the center  to give the test.&#160; She said that she would be fine so I went into the center to  give the pregnancy test.&#160; She asked me if I recognized her &amp; I said that she  did look familiar.&#160; After the negative test we talked about chastity.&#160; She had  one Depo shot &amp; hadn't gotten her period in 12 months.&#160; How bad is that.&#160; I  gave her some CD's &amp; A DVD &amp; other brochures &amp; the Truth packet.&#160;  She said that she lost a child when she was 2 years old.&#160; So I called the  Elizabeth Ministry to come to talk to her so that she could get some healing  from these great women.&#160; She left her name &amp; phone number on their answering  machine &amp; I know that they will call her back ASAP.&#160; She went into the  Material Aid Room to get some things for her other two children.&#160; She was happy  that we were there for her.&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I went back outside to be with Pat &amp;

I told her that I had a right to speak for I had  a&#160;Constitutional right to.&#160; I said that Planned Parenthood is making you their  victim.&#160; When she pulled out of the parking lot, in her all white car, she gave  me her middle finger.&#160;

After they had left I stayed for about another hour  or so doing some 'catch up' work in the office &amp; in the Material Aid Room.&#160;  All is went today &amp; I'll see you tomorrow dear Martha.&#160; Paul said that he  will come back tomorrow to work some more.&#160; Thanks Paul.&#160; I was told by Tickaboo  , from the taxi company, that our volunteer Ni came in on Monday &amp; cleaned  the Green Room &amp;

I told him on Tuesday that Martha's daughter &amp;  grandchildren&#160;were visiting, from Pennsylvania.&#160; He though that she would be out  for the entire week.&#160; It worked out&#160;in our favor because we sure could use his  help today. </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The door bell rang &amp;

Martha was nice enough to make a quick ham sandwich for her  &amp; I to eat quickly.&#160; As we were eating, our lunch,&#160;the doorbell rang &amp;  Paul was nice enough to&#160;answer it for us so that we could finish our lunch.&#160; As  we were about done with our lunch the doorbell rang again &amp; since Martha was  finished with her lunch &amp; she answered the doorbell at this time.&#160; How nice  of you Martha.&#160; After I finished my lunch my cell phone rang &amp; it was Pastor  Everett.&#160; He was coming to protest Planned Parenthood around 2pm today.&#160; I told  him that I would call Pat to tell her.&#160;I called Pat right away &amp; she wasn't  able to come today&#160;due to family issues.&#160; Her heart was in the right place but  her body wasn't able to make it today, which sadden us both.&#160; When Pastor  Everett arrived I set him up with the mega phone &amp; the literature box &amp;  the 2 graphic signs., for the front lines protest.&#160; I decided that I didn't want  him to be out there alone, on the front lines, so I came out to join him.&#160; It  was Rochester's first real snow fall today so it was cold, about 23 degrees,  &amp; we&#160;had snow on the ground.&#160; I didn't have enough clothing on, so I was  cold.&#160; I made the sacrifice because of all the people that lost their lives,  there at Planned Parenthood, over the many years that they have been murdering  children.&#160; Pastor Everett was by the fence with the mega phone speaking Truth to  Planned Parenthood, also he was offering help to the girls going in this place  of death.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The first girl was walking up the sidewalk to enter  Planned Parenthood.&#160;

She mumbled something &amp; then  walked into the Killing Mill.&#160; She came out less then 5 minutes later &amp; was  walking passed Pastor Everett &amp; I.&#160; He called for her to come over to him to  talk to him &amp; she did.&#160; I was amazed at her response to his request &amp;  noticed the importance of him being out there on the front lines.&#160; This goes for  Pat too, for she is also African American.&#160;What a difference they make out on  the front lines!&#160;

He told her to keep away from Planned Parenthood for they are destroying  the Black Race through abortion &amp; birth control.&#160; She agreed with him &amp;  said that she will keep away from this place.&#160;

then went  right over to the sidewalk to speak to Sheila &amp; her brother form Texas, for  a rundown of what had happened during the time that they were there this  morning.&#160; Sheila told me two incidents that occurred.&#160; The one, was a woman with  her daughter drove into Planned Parenthood &amp; as the mother &amp; daughter  were walking into the abortion mill Sheila had offered them assistance &amp; the  mother&#160;called out&#160;saying "shut up &amp; don't talk to my daughter for she's  going in for a infection or I'll kill you".&#160; I told Sheila that she should have  called the police to report this threat but it was her decision not mine.&#160; The  police want us to call them when a threat has been made.&#160; This mother, I  wish,&#160;would been confronted by the police, for what she said to Sheila.&#160; I pray  that all pro lifers, out on the sidewalk, will be safe through the protection of  God &amp; Mother Mary.&#160; God love Sheila for handling this situation with love  &amp; kindness &amp; her being calm.&#160; I just want to make sure that she's  protected, that's all.&#160;She told me that when the mother &amp; daughter walked  out of Planned Parenthood that she was there to help them &amp; for them to come  over to talk to her &amp; she gave them the day &amp; time that she is out  there.&#160; She's so cool, not like me.&#160; When they drove passed her the mother  didn't say or react in any way to her, thank God.&#160; The second incident, was the  husband of the wife that he brought in Planned Parenthood to have an abortion  stopped to talk to Sheila, on the sidewalk.&#160; He said that his wife has diabetics  &amp; has had 12 miscarriages &amp; they decided to abort this baby because she  wasn't feeling well.&#160; Sheila told him to name&#160;their baby &amp; that this was the  baby that the Lord was going to bless them with &amp; that they killed their  baby.&#160; She said that he should have trusted the Lord &amp; to repent for this  serious sin.&#160; She handed him a Truth packet &amp; our Focus brochure &amp; two  Rosaries to take with him.&#160; He left &amp; then came back later on to pick up his  wife who had just had their precious baby killed by Rachael Phelps, the  abortionist at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I feel sick.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I then said "hi" to her brother Dennis &amp; to  Paul.&#160; I saw that Rob had drove by us &amp; he then came to get the mega phone  &amp; the literature box &amp; a few of the graphic signs to take with him to  the brick side of the building., to protest.&#160;

I was so happy to see them.&#160; Well  they took the mega phone &amp; off they went &amp; spoke with Truth &amp;  Conviction for the next 3 hours.&#160; This was a monumental&#160;event &amp; a turning  point, in our sidewalk counseling, in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; It was a  prayer answered in the 16 years that Rob &amp; I have been out in front of this  place of Death.&#160; This is one thing that Planned Parenthood fears the most is the  uprising of the African American community, the very Race that they are  targeting.&#160; They spoke powerfully &amp; I was convicted that this was a prayer  answered.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; They told Planned Parenthood that they were not  going away &amp; they will be back with more people.&#160; Planned Parenthood is  shaking.&#160; They should.&#160; This is promising that Planned Parenthood will close  down.&#160; I'm encouraged.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>One car after another went into Planned Parenthood  to have their baby killed &amp;

A car drove passed  us &amp; I knew that they missed the turn &amp; sure enough the driver did miss  the turn &amp; made a U Turn, up the street,&#160;&amp; came back to Planned  parenthood.&#160; They killed their child too.&#160;

Donna replied  that she was doing a story about Hochesten to which the angry woman replied  "Hochesten" what's that got to do with anything, she called back.&#160; Donna said  "this&#160;is a&#160;story that I'm doing about Planned Parenthood &amp;

We are there at Focus to try to save lives &amp;  to change lives too, through the grace of God.&#160; The doorbell rang again &amp;  again, we were busy in helping our clients to get what they needed, in the  Material Aid Room.&#160;

she just quit about 6 months  ago.&#160; She said that she was here to get some papers &amp; was leaving  immediately.&#160; Sheila asked her what she did in there, &amp; she gave a reply  that is still upsetting me &amp; will be for such a long time, in the future.&#160;  She said that for years she took the pictures of the babies that Rachael Phelps  the abortionist just murdered in cold blood.&#160; I felt sick to my stomach when I  heard this &amp;

After Mass I went  to the center but never walked into it until about an hour &amp; a half later.&#160;  After I got out of my car&#160;I walked over to Planned Parenthood without my cell  phone, or literature box&#160;or signs.&#160; I just wanted to observe what was going on  in there &amp; I ended up staying until Martha came out to relieve me so that I  could get a sandwich.&#160; Valerie, our client &amp; friend,&#160;came out with the  literature box &amp; some signs &amp; the mega phone but for the longest time I  was without anything but just myself &amp; my voice that the Holy Spirit used.&#160;  Needless to say I was thrilled to see Martha come out to join me with her very  large rosary, to pray.&#160; She said that she had made me a sandwich &amp; that it  was in the refrig but when she said this two women walked passed us &amp; we  talked to them &amp; offered them a Truth packet.&#160; Then they&#160;said that they were  going to Focus for a pregnancy test so Martha went with them to the center to  give the test.&#160; I was still on the front lines but this time I had the mega  phone &amp; the literature box &amp; the signs.&#160; I had to go to the car to get  my phone which I put in my bag after church because I wasn't planning to be out  on the front lines today.&#160; I opened up the car &amp; got the phone &amp; put it  in my pocket &amp; then went back to the front lines to continue to sidewalk  counsel.&#160; I was standing by the fence after I had just prayed the Hail Mary  prayer &amp; then I was finishing up the St. Michael prayer when&#160;I head a voice  &amp; turned around to see an older man on a bike.&#160; He said that I couldn't be  where I was &amp; say what I was saying &amp; that he was going to call the  police &amp; he did right at the entrance to Planned Parenthood in the street.&#160;  Real smart guy!&#160; I asked him to stick around so that I could have him arrested  for making a false report but after he called me two very bad names he rode  off.&#160; I called put to him &amp; asked him to ask God to forgive him for his many  sins &amp; that God will.&#160; He called me a blank, blank &amp; continue riding.&#160;  Martha was just coming out on the sidewalk &amp; she heard him talk  disrespectfully to me &amp; added "you shouldn't speak like that while riding a  bicycle".&#160; I have dealt with this man&#160;in the past especially in the summer  months but because the winter is so mild everyone thinks that it's summer so we  have the same problems that we do in the summertime, with people.&#160; Lord have  Mercy!!&#160; About 10 minutes later the police came.&#160;He got out of his car &amp;  walked over to me &amp; said that he wouldn't have any problem in what we were  doing except using the mega phone. I said that it's in the Injunction of 2002  &amp; that we could use one &amp; that I could&#160;go to the pregnancy center up the  street to get it for him&#160; to look at. He said that it wasn't necessary &amp;&#160;I  said "thank you&#160;officer".&#160;I told him that&#160;I've dealt with this man in the past  &amp; that he was probably a post abortive father &amp; he just can't deal with  it &amp; that I wish that I could get through to him&#160;so that I could offer him  help.&#160; But so far that's a no go, which saddens me. &#160;I then told him that  Officer Chris was our advocate &amp;&#160;when you see&#160;him to&#160;please ask him to stop  by, for I have his Christmas card waiting for him.&#160;I said that I saw him a  couple of weeks before Christmas when he stopped by to say "hi".&#160;&#160;He said that  he would &amp; I then shook his hand &amp; I got his name &amp; I said that I'd  be praying for him, to which he replied "thank you &amp; have a great day".&#160; I  said "oh yes officer, you too".&#160; Off he went in his police car up the street.&#160;  What a nice officer he was!!&#160;</span></span></div></strong><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha then told me to go into the center to  eat my sandwich so I left but just then a&#160;pregnant woman was walking down the  street &amp; we offered her some baby cloths in the center.&#160; She said that she  was due in a couple of months&#160;&amp; that&#160;she had been walking for a long time  &amp; had to go to the bathroom.&#160; I said that we at the pregnancy center around  the corner had a bathroom &amp; we also have nice baby clothes too.&#160; She said  that she lives right&#160; up the street on University with her husband.&#160; Very good I  replied back &amp; started to walk with her down the sidewalk to the center so  she could use the&#160;bathroom.&#160; As we were walking she told me that she was having  twin&#160;girls so I stopped to tell her that Martha was a twin &amp; had a twin  sister too.&#160; So I walked back to where Martha&#160; was &amp; asked her if she would  go with her so that she could tell her of her twin sister.&#160; It's called  bonding.&#160; Off they went into the center.&#160; A few minutes&#160;later I called the  office of the center &amp; asked Martha&#160;to send out Valerie to be with me.&#160;  Valerie came out &amp; I&#160;asked her if she didn't mind to be there alone&#160;for a  few minutes so that I could go to the car &amp; get&#160;my bag with food in it &amp;  put it in the refrig for it was left in my car&#160;for a long time now.&#160; She said  that she didn't mind so I went to my car &amp; got&#160;the bag of food &amp; quickly  put it in the refrig &amp; then came&#160;right back outside.&#160; She said that she  wanted to go back into the center to help&#160;out the moms for she was afraid that  if anyone did anything to&#160;me that she would get real mad &amp; cause a scene.&#160; I  said no problem &amp; I will be fine until Martha comes back out.&#160; Off&#160;she went  back into the comfort of the center to do work in there. She puts the diapers  into plastic bags so that we can hand them out to our moms &amp; she helps them  in the Material Aid Room too.&#160; Thanks Val!!&#160; </span></strong></div></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></strong><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I  was now alone &amp; I was still unable to get my ham sandwich which was fine  because the main reason&#160;I'm there is to help people.&#160; The only thing that I was  worried about was that I had only cereal for breakfast &amp; I was starting to  feel&#160;a little woozy.&#160; I knew that if I fainted there was a good chance that I  would be still on the ground when Martha returned, though we do have our  faithful friends that give us much support when they drive by.&#160; They&#160;give us a  beep from their car &amp; a smile &amp; a wave too.&#160; So maybe technically  I&#160;wouldn't be on the ground for to long.&#160; Lets hope that I never have to test  this theory.</span></strong></div></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></strong><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">A  few minutes later Martha returned, on the sidewalk, &amp; I then went into the  center to eat my sandwich,&#160; While I was, in the center,&#160;Valerie was assisting  our clients with clothes &amp; non perishable food items.&#160; It's so good to see  the smiles on their faces.&#160; Just then a little girl came into the Green Room,  where I was eating my sandwich,&#160;with a pretty pink coat on.&#160; I said to her "oh  you so pretty in your pretty pink coat" &amp; she smiled at me &amp; looked down  at her coat.&#160; Just then there was a little boy coming out of the Great Room  which is next to the Green Room &amp; I asked&#160;the little girl&#160;if&#160;he was her  brother.&#160; She nodded 'no'.&#160; He dashed into the Material Aid Room &amp; I then  called out&#160;to&#160;all the moms to&#160;please&#160;make sure that you have your child near&#160;you  at all times, so that the right child will be with the right mother.&#160;

I was now by myself  again.&#160;Then&#160;there were two girls that came from around the bushes.&#160; The one Afro  American girl had long blonde hair &amp; she put her hand on her belly &amp;  said "I'm going to keep my baby".&#160; I asked her if she just found out if she was  pregnant &amp; she said "yes".&#160;&#160; I then asked her if Planned Parenthood asked  her if she wanted to abort her baby &amp; the two girls giggled.&#160; I said "I  thought so".&#160; Just then Valerie, our client helper, came outside so I asked if  she would bring them to the center to show them around.&#160; The girls said that  they needed to catch the bus to go to work but Valerie brought them to the  center for a quick tour so that they would know where we were located so that in  time the mom can come back to get some nice things for her baby.&#160; I gave them a  Truth packet &amp; a DVD of growth &amp; development of the baby &amp; our  brochure.&#160; They were very grateful for all the help.&#160; Wishing you both well  &amp; thank you for not being talked into having your precious baby be killed  there at Planned Parenthood.&#160;

I told her that condoms were bad &amp; no sex outside of marriage.&#160;  She hollered over to me about what the bible says about judging &amp; I said  that "God will not be mocked" &amp; that we as Christians are to judge  righteously the actions of the person.&#160; We are not to judge the heart, for God  alone judges the heart.&#160; She came out about 10 minutes later &amp; stopped her  car along side of where I was standing on the sidewalk &amp; say that she was  only playing with me &amp; that she needed the name of a good doctor.&#160; I went  over to the literature box &amp; got the doctors list &amp; the Truth packet  &amp; a CD called&#160;'Premarital&#160;Sex is Stupid'.&#160; She was grateful for all the  information &amp; said "thank you &amp; please be careful out here".&#160; I said  back to her that I will be careful &amp; that God is watching over me at all  times.&#160; She smiled at me &amp; then drove away.&#160;

there was Tucker coming down the sidewalk to take his  Wednesday evening position with his sign with the three babies on it.&#160; Just as  he was standing next to me a tattooed guy drove into the parking lot &amp;  parked right by the fence to where we were standing.&#160; Just then I saw that a  young girl was walking towards the car with her middle finger right up in the  air.&#160; I tried to talk to her about what was going on in there &amp; then told  her that&#160;the middle finger&#160;was a rape gesture.&#160; She looked awful &amp; I  wondered if she had an abortion in there.&#160; She got into the car &amp; as they  were leaving the parking lot he stopped &amp; rolled down the window &amp;  he&#160;said "what are you saying, no one here is having an abortion, I'm adopted".&#160;  I then said, as he was pulling out of the driveway, "I'm glad that your mother  didn't kill you".&#160; Just then she swung with a all her might a soda bottle from  the car with such force to the sidewalk &amp; it almost hit Tucker.&#160; I'm glad  that she didn't hit him, thank God.&#160; If she threw it a little higher it would  have hit him &amp;
