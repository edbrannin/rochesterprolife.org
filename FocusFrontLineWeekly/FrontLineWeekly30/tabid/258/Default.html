A girl came in for a pregnancy test, which Martha did, which was negative, while I was helping the pregnant mother with no home. She is married &amp; has 3 children &amp; pregnant with number four. She was so nice but so much has happened to her &amp; her family. Her husband sleeps in the car while her &amp; her children stay with her mother that drinks &amp; isn't nice to her or her children :(( Her husband just got a job so maybe in a little while they can get an apartment to live in before her baby is born in 3 weeks.....we hope so!! Her husband is a Catholic but doesn't go to church &amp; either is she or her children baptized &amp; go to church. I tried to help her with that problem. She said that she has a heart problem &amp; has had a stroke, I didn't notice anything wrong with her face. She said that she died twice, nice when she was a young child &amp; everything was beautiful &amp; another time, in her early 20's, &amp; everything was horrible. People with no faces grabbing her face &amp; screaming. Icky!! She was referred by her doctor to Focus. I gave her lots of numbers to call for a place to live but with no availability.....horrible. She had a smile on her face &amp; when we prayed for her she cried. We gave her a hug :)) She was a sweet woman &amp; we pray the best for her. </span></strong></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&#160;</p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We were very busy &amp; helped a lot of people today.

He pregnancy test was positive but she was 5 months pregnant so we couldn't refer her for a pregnancy test at His Branches. She was upset because her husband was abusive &amp; was trying to get away from him. She was new to the area. She asked to speak to a priest so I gave her Fr. Mickey McGrath's phone number to call. She was not abortion minded. Thank God. Martha called Dr. Morehouse's office to see if our client could call for pre natal care. She needed health insurance but she wouldn't give Catherine from Fidelis Care her Social Security number or her last name. Not sure why?

When I arrived at Focus I was putting the money in the meter when I heard Martha say that the meter she was at was not registering. There were people already at our door across the street waiting to come into the center. I told Martha to open up &amp; to call 311 to read meter. She did &amp; I continued to feed the meter more money. When I went into Focus I told the person who parked right in front on the center to go out &amp; put his flashing lights on or he could possibly get a ticket. He did. The I went to the office to put the bags I brought in &amp; to get the lock for the A-Frame sign. When I was putting out the sign a woman walked up to me &amp; said that a car was parked in front of the garage door across the street. I thank her for the information &amp; then walked back into Focus to ask who had the burgundy car &amp; to move it because it was parked in front of the garage. She came out with a pac'n play. I told her to leave it here to move her car because she needed to sign the wavier. She went &amp; moved her car abruptly in front of two parking meters. When she got out of the car I asked her to move up because she was blocking two meters (I thought that it wasn't fare if someone wanted to park there &amp; couldn't). She came out of her car like a bear &amp; the trouble began. She came back into the center &amp; was not nice to me. I lost it. I confess that I did raise my voice &amp; I was not happy with me. She got her diapers &amp; left. She did not get the pac'n play......I don't know why. Maybe it was because she was mad at me for telling her what to do :(( </span></strong></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&#160;</p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I went over to the building next door to say hi to Mike, for the girls in the center, said that he was real nice.

No Martha today &amp; I was worried how it would go without her but it went very well. &#160;Not busy at all. &#160;I did miss her but know she was having fun with her two grandchildren. &#160;She deserves it!!!<br /><br />
A pro life man came up our three steps to say to me "Mary I'd like to give you my knee pain for a day" to which I replied "I'd like to give you my abdominal pain &#160;for the rest of your life". &#160;He then asked for water to which I said I would pour him a glass to which he replied "no I'm getting a bottle from the refrig" which he did &amp; drank. &#160;I told him that I was saving the water for the people that were coming out on the front lines in front of Planned Parenthood tomorrow &amp; I didn't have enough. &#160;He was a bit nasty but that is not unusual for this man. &#160;Pain changes people's personalities for sure. &#160;I hope &amp; pray that he feels better soon. &#160;Mike Mc went &amp; got 4 huge containers of water at Wegmans for us at Focus.....thank you so much!!<br /><br />
We had two women that came in &amp; helped put some things away....how nice was that!<br /><br />
I did a pregnancy test on a shy 17 year old girl &amp; it was Negative.... &#160;I asked her to look at me while I was talking to her &amp; told her to come back next Thursday or Friday if she didn't get her period yet. &#160;She took all the DVD's &amp; the Truth packet that I make up. &#160;Hope it helps!!<br /><br />
Catherine &amp; I had a nice long talk toady very rare. &#160;A nice young lady. &#160;<br /><br />
