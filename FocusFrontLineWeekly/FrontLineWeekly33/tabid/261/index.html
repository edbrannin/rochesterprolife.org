I then told her "no sex until you are married". &#160;We love the kids but we don't like moms bad behavior. Sorry if this sounds judgement but it isn't. What's right is right &amp; what's is wrong is wrong. Another pregnant woman came in &amp; we asked where her boyfriend was &amp; she said "he's in jail". Okay!!! &#160;Her behavior was weird. &#160;Hope she does well in the world. &#160;</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: large;"> </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Neyoka came in with donations from A Second Thought Resale Shop. &#160;Great for we have many things to give out. &#160;One can of formula left &amp; I can't buy anymore until I receive more money :((( &#160;sad!!!</strong></span>&#160;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><hr /><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Wednesday, September 6, 2017 at Focus</span></strong></span></span></span></p><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I had to get pictures of Martha &amp; I taken for the next Focus newsletter. &#160;That was a chore. &#160;Lynda did a great job &amp; I emailed them to Gene who works on the newsletter, &#160;He also wanted a picture of Our Lady too. &#160;After that a young pregnant mother came in &amp; she asked for help with her donations. &#160;She said that her baby's father was in the car &amp; he came out to help. &#160;I asked if they were married &amp; he exclaimed that he wasn't told fashioned. &#160;I said that we cared about their souls. &#160;She said that they had another child &amp; handed her the '10 Commandments' to take with them. &#160;He gave me a look like he could do me harm. &#160;I guess he doesn't l think about his soul. &#160;Hope she does.....</strong></span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Lynda is here today &amp; we are blessed for we were given so many bags of donations that the people that were here were going through the bags &amp; taking so much I had to tell them that there are other people that need things too. &#160;Please just take what you need....they usually do!!</strong></span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><hr /><p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Thursday, Se</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">ptember 7, 2017 at Focus</span></strong></span></p><p>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>There was Martha, Frank Jackie &amp; Martha's &amp; Franks daughter Lisa was ere helping us. &#160;We received so many large bags of donations &amp; we needed all the help we could get. &#160;Neyoka said that her &amp; her helper will finish putting the rest of the bags away. &#160;Team Work!!!</strong></span></span></p><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br /></strong></span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Martha did a pregnancy test yesterday &amp; I noticed her had had two previous abortions. &#160;Martha said that she was here not long ago for a pregnancy test.
