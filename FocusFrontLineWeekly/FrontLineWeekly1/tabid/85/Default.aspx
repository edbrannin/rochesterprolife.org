A sidewalk counselor/prayer warrior &amp; I were on the street near Planned Parenthood praying &amp; holding a graphic sign when a car pulled up &amp; the gentleman said "my girlfriend is pregnant &amp; wants an abortion". I asked her if this was so &amp; she said "yes". We invited her to come into the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center for a more comfortable place to discuss this matter. After the counselor spoke with the client &amp; I spoke with the gentleman the final results were that she was no longer abortion minded &amp; was going to have her baby. We will keep in touch with her &amp; follow-up on her pregnancy &amp; care. She also took a packet of vital informational pamphlets for her use. Thank you Lord Jesus &amp; Our Lady of Guadeloupe.

This is not judging but over the years this seems to be the case. When they get out of their car &amp; come into our faces sooner or later they admit of their involvement. We try to help them &amp; offer our prayers for them. This is the first step in their healing.

He seemed nice I'll send him some of our info regarding Planned Parenthood which I do.

He answered "Yes", my girlfriend had had an abortion. He almost cried &amp; he received assistance from the pro-lifers.

My prayers and tears are endless for the people who made a choice for death for their children. Some of the people who drive by &amp; the neighbors &amp; businesses don't understand. Planned Parenthood is in Rochester killing Rochester's own. We care and people want to hurt us. The police reports, over the past 11 years prove that. WHERE IS THE OUTCRY!!! I sometimes I feel that I'm in "Twilight Zone" (for those who can remember) episode and it never goes to commercial. Our hearts are for helping people with the truth. If people hate us that's okay with me. We will prevail with the grace &amp; guidance of God, who is in charge.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Handed out some baby clothes from the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center to a new mom who was 2 months pregnant.

On August 28th.@ 3PM the National Organization of Women (NOW) were protesting Sen. Joseph Robach (R) in Greece, NY to demand that the NYS Legislature pass the NY State Reproductive Health and Privacy Protection Act (RHPPA) introduced by Gov. Spitzer earlier this year. The RHPPA bill would amend or repeal various statutes in the old law to ensure that the NYS protects a woman's right to choose the course of her pregnancy and to use or refuse contraceptives. Further, the law would establish a fundamental, statuary right to privacy for women in making personal reproductive decisions. Ick!! This is DANGEROUS for the pre-born baby. They want the right to kill anywhere, anytime &amp; by anybody, nothing could be worse for a woman &amp; her child. According to NOW-NYS President Marcia A. Pappas, "This bill will revise NY State's outdated abortion law, originally enacted in 1970. Because Sen. Robach is blocking passage of this bill, NOW is targeting him with the message that it is time for all legislators to be on board to protect women's health". Dear Marcia "abortion is not health care but death care to an innocent baby (person). There protest, against an unwavering Senator, was met by 12 prayerful &amp; peaceful pro-life protesters. Our prayers went up to Heaven invoking God to help, heal &amp; convert them to the truth. The pro-choice men pushed &amp; showed 3 women, myself included, on the public sidewalk. The pro-death speakers were interrupted by prayer especially the Rosary.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4">&#160;<img width="93" height="115" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/Hassellth04.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4">&#160;Sen.

I asked her if she needed any baby clothes &amp; she said "Yes" so I brought her to the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center to give her 3 month old baby girl some clothes. She was happy. She also took a packet of information with her. If she needs anything else in the future I said for her to just call the Center &amp; we will help her.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A young woman drove bye and said "thank you" &amp; I replied back "No thank you, you touched my heart" &amp; she then hollered back "This is genocide", I agreed.

I stated that they were not sex experts but sex perverts. They teach masturbation, gay sex &amp; anything goes sex. She took a packet with lots of info. When her daughters came out of Planned Parenthood they reacted to the graphic pictures of aborted babies. What an eye opener for the girls. A picture speaks a thousand words.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A woman drove by and hollered out her window that she loved abortion. I hope &amp; pray that she gets out of denial &amp; gets the help, forgiveness &amp; healing that she &amp; other post-abortive women need. Abortion makes one ugly acting.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">One of Planned Parenthood workers came out &amp; went by me as she was walking home. I asked if she would like a packet of information to take with her. She said that she already had one &amp; gave it to her son. I asked her to step out in faith &amp; trust Jesus for a new job. No excuses dear lady for you or anyone else that works at Planned Parenthoods killing clinic. We are praying for you all.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Two young girls were by their car which had some young children in it. I offered them some information but they declined. They were rude &amp; I only felt badly that they were not open to the truth or any help. I prayed the Chaplet of Mercy for them &amp; for another car which had a man sitting in it. I waited for awhile, for Tucker had already left. I broke the rule of the street, I was by myself. I was trusting in the Lord. A very young girl came out of Planned Parenthood walking very slowly &amp; painfully to the car with the two girls &amp; young children. I went on my knees &amp; stated as they drove by me "I pray that you didn't kill your baby" the girl who was sitting in the back seat gave me such a demonic look that it sent shivers up &amp; down my spine &amp; I just wanted to cry. The bondage of sin. It's frightening to behold. As I tried to calm down I looked over to the death security guard Mark, an off duty police officer, who professes to be a Christian no less. He's only fooling himself not God. He was at the side of the Buckpitt building, a business next to Planned Parenthood, practicing his golf swings. If you want to know what evil looks like come to Planned Parenthood as an observer. You might even see the devil himself.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">At the end of all of this I say my Our Father, Hail Mary &amp; Glory Be for all the people that I encountered at this time. I give it all to Jesus for I would burst if I didn't &amp; only He can help all these people with His LOVE &amp; MERCY. All I can be is His instrument &amp; a bad one I am. He takes the weak &amp; makes them strong. His grace is sufficient. I put them in my heart &amp; then give them to Jesus &amp; then He takes them &amp; puts them in His heart.

The sidewalk counselor was talking to the clients going into Planned Parenthood to offer them help. A packet of information was handed out to one the girls going into Planned Parenthood for the Hip Teen Program, a paid program for teenagers affiliated with Strong Memorial Hospital. The same Hospital where they have the "Planned Parenthood Termination Clinic" on the 2nd. floor where Nancy Stanwood murders babies in the operating room on Wednesday mornings. SMH &amp; PP are in bed together. Later when I got there on the street I was told that the next door neighbor of Planned Parenthood let her dog pee on our sign of the aborted babies. I said that if a police car drives by I will flag him down, which is what happened about 15 minutes after I said that. He was on his way to another call but he said that he would call it in. So in the next 10 minutes a police car came with 2 officers in it. We proceeded to tell the officers of the neighbor when they said that they had been called because of the mega phone which was being used. He asked if we had a permit &amp; I told him that we didn't need one for we have been out here 11 years protesting this abortion mill which we have a right to do. As for the mega phone we also have a right to use that too, of course not too loudly, which is hard to determine at times. He also said that they have a choice why don't you just hand the packet out &amp; not say anything. I took a deep breath &amp; explained to him the a woman does not have a choice to kill her baby that it was dead wrong. And another thing, if we don't use our voices to call out to the girls &amp; tell them what we have how are they to know. He started to look at the difficult pictures that we had on the sidewalk &amp; turned away. He said not to block the sidewalk &amp; I explained that "We do not, people can walk by freely". Another police car came on the scene &amp; that officer was the one that was called regarding the neighbor &amp; her dogs. We told him what happened &amp; all 3 policemen walked to the neighbor's house. They stood there for about 25 minutes when one of the protesters walked across the street to walk again across the street to the policemen to tell them we were about to leave. (Remember that there is an unconditional buffer zone at Planned Parenthood &amp; we as tax paying citizens cannot utilize the whole sidewalk). We go to the 12:10 Mass at Our Lady of Victory down the street after protesting. When the sidewalk counselor came back he told me that the neighbor wouldn't answer the door &amp; the police were waiting to see if she finally would.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We pray for her &amp; all the neighbors &amp; businesses in the neighborhood for their conversion, repentance, salvation &amp; for their silence against the slaughter of the unborn, right under their noises.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wednesday_evening_September_5%2C_2007_in_front_of_Planned_Parenthood&amp;action=edit" title="Wednesday evening September 5, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood" class="new"><strong><font size="4">Wednesday evening September 5, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></a></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><center><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=3817675962.jpg" title="Image:3817675962.jpg" class="new"><strong><font size="4"><img width="125" height="73" src="/Portals/0/protest_pics/3757244784.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></a></center><p><strong><font size="4">We had two female sidewalk counselors gracing the sidewalk near Planned Parenthood's killing mill tonight.

Abortion is the violent dismembering of the body of a human being thus taking his or her life. The gentleman stated that the picture he was holding upset his child in the car. We have found over the years of being on the street that this really isn't true. The adults are bothered by the picture &amp; blame it on their child. Young children have no concept of what they just saw, as their parent or parents drove by us but the parents do. By the reaction of the parent the child reacts to the upset parent. One child once said "who broke the baby". At the end of the brief conversation the sidewalk counselor &amp; the gentleman shook hands. He stated that he lived in the neighborhood &amp; wrote for a local newspaper I challenge him to pray &amp; protest Planned Parenthood too. Why would you want, as your neighbor, someone who murders children for money.

Most of the girls took a "truth packet" going into Planned Parenthood but came out without them. I gave one of the girls another packet &amp; told her to share with her friends. Planned Parenthood doe not want girls or anyone to know the truth. The truth is bad for business. One of the girls when looking at the graphic pictures of aborted babies that we use to tell the truth said "Planned Parenthood told them it was nothing". It's easy to kill nothing but a baby is different. One time a young girl came out of there and looked at the picture and said that Planned Parenthood told her that "it was nothing" &amp; went ahead with the abortion only to find out that it wasn't nothing, it was her baby. She cried and we told her to call Project Rachel at 800/972-2435 a post abortion help line. So many girls have been lied to and deceived at Planned Parenthood. How they demoralize a human being by saying that he or she is nothing making it easier to kill. We profilers pick up the shattered pieces of people that made the awful decision to have their baby aborted by Planned Parenthood. I invited two girls that came out of Planned Parenthood, to the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center for a DVD on the illustrated bloodless abortion procedure and one on ultrasound. We had a good talk and they took some of the literature that we have. We stress to young people to wait to have sex until marriage &amp; they agreed.

Only after going to court he came right back that very same night when I was on the street. The police said because the judge didn't put it in writing that they couldn't do anything about it.

Killing babies at Planned Parenthood today. A lot of abuse from the people going into this "place of death". Our elderly male pro-lifer, who just turned 78 said to a woman coming out of Planned Parenthood "choose life" and she answered back "I just had an abortion" &amp; ran off. One car driving by said to the sidewalk counselor "go back to Iran". I guess he thinks that there is freedom in killing one's own baby. He made a U turn up the street came back pass the counselor hollering the same thing to which she replied "I have your license plate number". She didn't see him again. A woman with a suit on was walking into Planned Parenthood with a young girl. Could this woman be a 'social worker'? Nothing like ruining one's life. The young girl kept on looking at the pictures. Was the apparent social worker bringing this young girl in for an abortion? She did this girl such a disservice. Poor girl! The sidewalk counselor offered her help but the woman with suit lead her in the "place of death". There was a young guy waiting in the car &amp; on his car was a black &amp; white flag with a skulls head. He gave the counselor two birds at once with his hands going up &amp; down. Guilty conscious maybe. We hope &amp; pray that they all repent &amp; get love &amp; mercy &amp; forgiveness from the dear Lord who is so greatly offended by their sins. We've noticed that many of the workers at Planned Parenthood are having rosaries on their car mirrors. Maybe they think that if they have a rosary in their car that maybe what they're doing working at Planned Parenthood is okay. Twisted thinking or maybe that their conscious is starting to bother them. I once said to the workers "you praise God on Sunday then kill His children on Monday". Planned Parenthood is now using spirituality in the murdering of God's innocent babies. How sick. Three young people in a car drove into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood &amp; just kept on looking at the graphic pictures. They didn't get out &amp; drove away. Could that have been a 'save'? I certainly hope so.

Gantt was approached by me in our shared parking lot in the strip mall, 2 doors down from Planned Parenthood, to invite him to Randall Terry's speaking engagement at the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center on Monday. I walked over to him &amp; said “Hello Mr. Gantt how are you tonight”. I had the invitation paper in my hands &amp; was trying to hand it to him. He said to me "I told you that I don't want any of this". He thought that I was trying to give him some information that would educate him about what Planned Parenthood is doing to the Black race right down the street from his office. They're killing off the Black race &amp; Mr. Gantt doesn’t want to know anything about it. So I said to him "I'm inviting you to a talk to be given by Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, he's going to speak at the FOCUS Pregnancy Center on Monday. No, No, No he replied back. I then said "we're trying to save your race down the street in front of Planned Parenthood". He then replied "No White person has ever helped any Black person". Wow, I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS! I never really knew of a Black person, let alone an Assemblyman, to be prejudice against the White race. I guess anyone can be prejudice no matter what color their skin is. He then coughed up a big spit ball &amp; then spited it out right in front of the restaurant where he was going into. I know after that, I might have trouble eating later. Thanks Mr. Gantt how discussing. How evil acting of you Mr. Gantt, for being closed minded &amp; helping to kill off your Black race at Planned Parenthood by not speaking up against abortion. Are you in bed with Planned Parenthood? Shame on you. Please REPENT!!!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Revjohn.jpg" title="Image:Revjohn.jpg" class="new"><strong><font size="4"><img width="160" height="111" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/Revjohn.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></a></p><p><strong><font size="4">Rev.

A young woman came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; told me that she was a pro-choice &amp; was adopted. I then replied "you are not pro-choice but pro-death that in your choice a baby dies &amp; how come you're not pro-life? She screamed back I hate my .... mother. I can't put on the web site what she called her biological mother. I then replied "Forgive her, she could have had you killed you but she gave you up to your adoptive parents". Then I told her my story briefly. But what really was closer to her experience was that in my own family my older sister was raped by knife point, in her own apartment, in 1975 &amp; conceived. The so-called doctor in the Emergency Room told her to go for an abortion but she said "No'" &amp; had her baby girl. The baby girl grew up to hate her biological mother. I have said to her "forgive her for whatever you don't like about her because she gave you life &amp; she could have had you killed". She won't be free just like this young girl won't be free until they both forgive their 1st mothers for whatever reason that they have in their hearts against them.</font></strong></p><p><br /><font size="4" color="#800000"><strong>Counseling of Children of Rape</strong></font></p><p><a href="http://www.christiansurvivors.com/childcounselling.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.christiansurvivors.com/childcounselling.html" class="external free"><strong>http://www.christiansurvivors.com/childcounselling.html</strong></a></p><p><br /><font size="4" color="#800000"><strong>Bethany Adoption Agency</strong></font></p><p><a href="http://www.bethany.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bethany.org/" class="external free"><strong>http://www.bethany.org/</strong></a></p><p><strong>&#160;&#160;</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thursday_afternoon_October_4%2C_2007_in_front_of_Planned_Parenthood&amp;action=edit" title="Thursday afternoon October 4, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood" class="new"><font size="4"><strong>Thursday afternoon October 4, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></a></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;From 10AM to 12NOON in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p><p><br /><font size="4"><strong>It went pretty well, I think.

She gave her a packet &amp; told the young girl to give this to her mother with love. I hope this young girl will not follow in her mothers footsteps someday. There is a thing called 'Generational Sin &amp; Curses' that need much prayer &amp; fasting for deliverance so that the same pattern will not repeat itself to the present generation.

He also said that it is a boring job but we make it exciting. Jim, you need to "Get a Life" better yet Jim, you need to "Save a Life". You're working for murders of innocent, defend less, voiceless babies. How sick is YOUR job. He also said that I don't listen. Who would want to listen to man of no reason? I don't. He says that it's his job. I said that you have the lowest of all jobs (next to the abortionist &amp; his or her staff). Get a real job that doesn't shed innocent blood Jim. I hope &amp; pray that he repents along with the so called Catholic security guard (retired police officer) Doug, who attends St. Helen's Church. We have told him not to go to Holy Communion until he goes to Confession &amp; never return to Planned Parenthood ever again. This is a sacrilege, a very serious sin a mortal sin.

When I arrived around 4:00 p.m. there were four young people waiting inside the Focus Pregnancy Center to speak to someone. They had left Planned Parenthood after waiting for awhile for a pregnancy test. They were nervous and I didn't get the whole story for awhile so I began to show them a videotape that shows the true horrors of abortion. The young man and one of the young woman in the group then told me that they believed that the young woman was pregnant. They told me the high schools that they attended and they commended a Churchville Chili health teacher who had spoken strongly against abortion. I connected them up with another area pregnancy center. I reminded them that if she was pregnant, she was already a Mom and he a Dad- abortion doesn't reverse that. I told them that they had made a mistake but not to make it worse by abortion. I also told them that while they might not be old enough to raise their child, they could give the child up for adoption so that someone else could. Fortunately, both of these young people said that their parents were aware of the situation and were somewhat supportive. My prayers are with them that they have the strength in this difficult situation, if the pregnancy is confirmed, to allow their child to enter the world. All through this situation, even though it took me by surprise, I felt the hand of God and a sense of peace and I truly believe that this young couple is going to do what is right. I gave six 'Truth packets' out this evening .

Our team was there defending life in front of Planned Parenthood tonight. The pro-lifer who sets up the signs on the sidewalk does a great job demonstrating the truth about “baby killing’ at Planned Parenthood. As people drive by they are educated about this horror in Rochester &amp; the country. Some give the bird &amp; others give a beep or thumbs up. Can you imagine that the people who see these pictures of murdered babies can be so disrespectful? How awful!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<br /><img width="150" height="95" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/3078654688.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="4">Our sweet lady who dives bye to say “Thank You” blessed us again this evening.

My partner &amp; I ventured to Seneca Falls to protest Planned Parenthood's VOX Conference (which meams Voice in Latin). I don't know whose Voice they are talking about because it sure isn't the voice of the unborn or most Americans in regards to abortion. This is a group that targets the college age females to indoctrinate them to Planned Parenthood's way of thinking, which is sick. This is VOX, in Planned Parenthood's own words. [[Vox: Voices for Planned Parenthood is a program to educate and mobilize students and youth in support of reproductive health and rights. Vox groups across the country organize public events, educate their peers, support their local Planned Parenthood health centers, and mobilize students and other young people to speak out for reproductive rights and access to reproductive health services. Vox members get involved! We organize and let politicians know that our reproductive choices are important to us and must be protected. Join us!]] I hope NOT. Well, I can say that my partner &amp; I sort of joined them today but in a way that they didn't like. We went to the Holiday Inn, in Seneca Falls, &amp; protested their VOX Conference, to which we think 12 misguided women showed up for. We were at the entrance, of the Inn, showing Reproductive Rights graphic pictures of aborted babies. Why were they so upset? Isn't this what they are fighting for? To be be able to do this to their baby? How confusing! The Managers of the Holiday Inn came out &amp; told my partner to move off the grass because he was their property. He told them it was the imp easement &amp; not their property. I said that we were here because of Planned Parenthood. To which the female Manager replied that I had my opinion &amp; they had theirs. To which I replied that I do hope that you will not have them back here next year to collect more 'Blood Money'. My partner then said "Next year, if you do, we'll have 10 more people with us". Then the male worker then said "You just made a threat, you just threatened us" to which I snickered &amp; said "A threat is when one threatens ones personhood by stating to cause harm or death to that person". That's not what was said. They both then just walked away back into the Inn. The people driving bye were mostly unresponsive, I feel that's because they mostly were in shock. The average person doesn't know what 'Baby Killing' looks like. They've been told that it is just a clump of tissue &amp; if you don't want it in your body an longer you can just go to Planned Parenthood or an abortionist to get it scraped out. WHAT A LIE! If you are pregnant then you are going to have a 'baby' not a clump of tissue. A grandfather, driving bye, gave us the 'bird' as his granddaughter was looking at the pictures out her window. How sad of you Grandpa, it's a good thing that she didn't see you do that. A VOX girl pulled in the Holiday Inn driveway for the conference &amp; gave me the 'bird' to which I replied "Repent, Hell is forever". A car with 3 people pulled out of the driveway from Ontario &amp; was very receptive to what we were doing out there. I went over to them &amp; gave them a 'Truth packet' to which they said "Thank you" &amp; left. Wow! The non Americans was the most friendly. I said to them "Thank you".</font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="4">A man was walking on the property of the Holiday Inn &amp; came over to us when I said to the girls going in the hotel that Planned Parenthood kills babies &amp; doesn't care about you. He then came right over &amp; said "Not only are you showing propaganda but speaking it too". He also said in regards to the graphic pictures that these were not embryos". I asked if he had been involved in an abortion &amp; he stated he absolutely had". My partner talked mostly to him but the conversation just went around &amp; around &amp; around. He said that he was a Psychiatrist &amp; treated children. How ironic. We talked to him for a long time &amp; he just didn't want to put any personhood to these children, in the womb. I then showed him my little plastic 10 week old baby &amp; his attitude then changed. I think that the good Lord touched his heart. He shook my partner's hand &amp; I went over to shake his. I asked him his name &amp; gave him ours. We will be praying for his continual healing, conversion &amp; reparation for his sin of abortion &amp; that he will ask Jesus to forgive him, which He will.

Two police cars drove in the Holiday Inn &amp; was in there for about 15 minutes or so. Then they walked over to us. I said "Hello officers. We're just acting out our Constitutional right to Freedom of Speech". They said that they agreed &amp; we had a nice conversation with them. No problems. The Sergeant even said that we had a right to the grass to where the pole was. He even preferred it for 'our safety'. I don't believe it! Someone who cares about us. I just want to thank Sergeant Kelly &amp; his partner (I didn't get his name &amp; I apologize for that. My partner &amp; I prayed for pro-life police &amp; God answered our prayers.

She was walking passed me &amp; I started speaking with her. She said that she was going into Planned Parenthood for the Hip Teen Program &amp; I started to tell her about the ‘Truth packet’ when all of a sudden I saw the two death escorts Sylvia Rose &amp; Barry Whitehead approaching us on the sidewalk. I started to say “Get away from us, Go”, for they are a threat to our ministry. Then I found that Barry Whitehead was in my face, he had crossed over yellow line. He was confronting me with his body. I felt like they were coming over to kidnap this young girl. She walked with them into Planned Parenthood. The trauma I felt as this evil acing man was in my face brought back the some of the traumas I experienced in my past. These people are evil acting. They act as accomplices to the murders which take place in Planned Parenthood. They are the ones who drive the get away car in a bank robbery they are still guilty of the crime which was committed in the bank. My heart was raising &amp; I felt sick to my stomach. The only consolation was that the young girl wasn’t going there for an abortion or for birth control. I t hen called the police. The 911 operator was rude. I told her about the incident &amp; she asked me what they were wearing &amp; when I told her that they were wearing aprons that read Planned Parenthood on them she then said “What are you saying that they have no pants on”. O boy! I told her t hat they cover their clothing or coats with the blue PP apron. She then said that she would send a police car to the scene. I had witnesses which saw it all. Two police cars arrived about 10 minutes later. Both officers got out of their cars &amp; one walked over to me. As this was happening, the Catholic retired police officer / security guard of Planned Parenthood (Doug Salisbury) got out of his car &amp; walked over to the second policeman with a smirk on his betrayal face. I explained the incident to the officer &amp; he then asked me some questions to which I replied. He then walked away from me &amp; headed towards the other 2 men. He came back with the same attitude &amp; said that no arrests will be made. I wanted to talk with him some more but he walked away. The officers never spoke with the other sidewalk counselor who was also there for this incident &amp; neither officers spoke with the 2 death escorts who got in our faces. How do you say, I feel the bias. As he was walking away the other sidewalk counselor said to him “Have a blessed day, we will be praying for you”. As the other officer was getting in his car I said to him “That if one if your children needed protecting I would protect them too.

I asked the Pastor to speak to him &amp; I will follow through on this. I also told the new death escorts that they are not to come to the sidewalk &amp; get in our faces. I think that they agreed. I also said that the incident with the 2 death escorts that got in the 2 sidewalk counselors faces, last week, was not finished by a long shot. I received a letter from a Lawyer that stated: "The police are trying very hard to fight violent crime in the City &amp; therefore should not be acting as a private security force for a very wealthy, private enterprise.

This occurred at 12:30 AM when I &amp; six gentlemen were out, in front of Planned Parenthood, to pray from 12 midnight to 1AM. We all were saying the rosary when a middle aged woman came out of the side street onto University Ave. She walked right up to me &amp; asked what this was all about. I said that we were praying to end abortion. She then said "It was okay if it was from a rape". I said "No it was not". She said that she had been raped &amp; had an abortion but she was forgiven. Then I asked her if she was truly sorry for the abortion. She said that she was not. I said to her that she was not forgiven, for she had to be truly sorry for taking a life. She said that she was raped, that it wasn't consensual. I said that it wasn't your fault but it wasn't the fault of the baby either to be conceived &amp; that the baby shouldn't die for the violent crime of the father. I said that he should be jail to which she replied that he was. She got very angry at me but took a Rosary &amp; thanked me for it. I stressed that she would be forgiven of her sin if she confessed it with a sincere heart. People don't realize the seriousness of this sin against God &amp; upon ones own soul. Remember that this little person didn't ask to be conceived but the Good Lord allowed it &amp; that is enough for me. A woman can't get over a rape but in time it isn't as painful anymore but she can never get over an abortion, which is painful all the time. This woman was also in prison, in her mind, for what she had done to her baby. Yes, even in a rape this little person who is there now is hers too not totally the rapist. It's not the victim nor the baby's fault. Adoption is an option never abortion. A life is a life is a life. We cannot play God. God didn't say life was going to be easy only that He would be with us through it all Trust in Him.</strong></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;</strong></font></p><font size="4"><strong><hr /></strong></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>Monday</strong></font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saturday_morning_November_3%2C_2007_in_front_of_Planned_Parenthood&amp;action=edit" title="Saturday morning November 3, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood" class="new"><font size="4"><strong> November 5, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></a></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;<br />

I then found myself in the parking lot, next to the other side of the building, trying along with two other Side Walk Counselors to talk to two young girls who were heading to their car.&#160; There was a young man in the driver’s seat that let them in.&#160; We pleaded with them to go home and showed them pictures of babies.&#160; I took out my rosary and told them that this was not the answer and that she was carrying a little baby girl.&#160; The guy in the car looked at me with a puzzled look on his face, kind of like a smirk, it made me cringe.&#160; I left the counselors and then tried to identify the older man who was driving a red sports car talking with someone from the death mill.&#160; I told the local people and they thought that he was the anesthesiologist not the abortionist because he had a mustache &amp; this guy didn’t.&#160; I was now on the sidewalk where I saw two black women, one was holding a baby, going towards the blocked doors.&#160; The grandmother left with the baby in a blanket and the abortion manager put the girl, along with another girl, in a white van.&#160; I stayed there &amp; pleaded with the two girls the in the van not to have an abortion &amp; that we were there to help them.&#160; Two other girls were put into a car next to the van and the sidewalk counselor spoke in love to them not to have their babies killed. </span></font></span><o:p></o:p></strong></font></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="4"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;

The girl was screaming at her and then walked up the street towards Main St.&#160; I then was&#160;aware of which just happened and hollered to the girl that she was just too angry and for her to repent (which means to change ones life&#160;by asking God to forgive our sins and not to repeat that sin again by asking for&#160;God's help and grace to conquer it).&#160;&#160;After that we had a very angry street person come bye and just stand there and scream at us for about 5 minutes straight.&#160;&#160;I said "Hi" to him for I knew him and he just screamed some more.&#160; I was ready to call&#160;911 if I had to for he&#160;was unpredictable&#160;and we need to be protected when we are out there.&#160; What really happened was he has&#160;come bye for years and we would talk with him and give him food.&#160; Then one day when one of the other female sidewalk counselor was out on the sidewalk, on Thursday, and she was counseling some girls, he came bye and was disturbing her with gross behavior and was disturbing the scene.&#160; She told me about&#160;his bad behavior and when I saw him again I said to him not to do that again.&#160; He&#160;called me a name and walked away talking loudly and really hasn't been back as much since.&#160;

Then a car came in with a woman and her 2 young children probably around&#160;5 and&#160;6 years of age.&#160;&#160;We called out to her when she left the car alone with her 2 children in the car with the mortor running.&#160; I said that if she didn't gert her kids out of the car I would call the Police.&#160; When she came out abbout 1/2 hour later I told her that I was going to call the Police after I got her License #, which I did.&#160; Martha helped me &amp; we called the Police and asked for a car to come for a Report.&#160; In the meantime, the&#160;Death Security Guard, Doug Salisbury, poped his head out the window and I screamed to him not to get out of&#160;his car when the Police come, to which he said something in return I cannot repeat on my web site.&#160; It was very icky and&#160;I can tell you that and no gentleman would ever said that to a Lady.&#160; But again look where he works and who he gets his $ from. &#160;It figures, though how sad!!&#160;&#160; There was an incident about 2 months ago when I called the Police on the 2 Death Escorts who approached us 2 pro lifers on the sidewalk and where in our faces, as we were talking to a youg girl who had, walked bye.&#160; When the Police came, Doug Salisbury came out of his car and approached the Police and spoke with him.&#160; The Police should have spoke with the 2 Death Escorts instead of the Death Security Guard, for it was about them and not him.&#160; I just didn't want him to interfer with this situation.&#160; He was once a Police Officer about 7 years ago and when I call the Police I don't want the situation to be biased.&#160; He then moved his car closer to me where I was standing on the sidewalk.&#160; He said that people laugh at me &#160;for my hollowering at them and I replied that "They are killing babies in there and you&#160;should be upset by that and so should they".&#160; Imagine being calm as children are being murdered.&#160; It is Politically Correct to accet this atrosity and not be upset.&#160; Numbing of Americans of the murdering of it's children.&#160; Not&#160; just American children but God's children who He created.&#160; How dare he.&#160;&#160; I saw the Police car coming down the street and I stopped him by the&#160;Strip&#160; Mall anf in fron of Planed Parenthood. &#160; I told him of the situation of the mother and 2 children and he unfortatuntaly told me that there was no law against children left alone in the car though when a car is running then it would be considered 'Child Endargerment' and then a ticket could be issued.&#160;This was bad parenting for sure he said. &#160;So next time a car comes in and the mother leaves her&#160;young child or&#160;children in the car alone with the car running then I will call the Police ASAP before I get the License #.&#160; After Officer Henry left I spoke with Doug the Death Security Guard again.&#160; I asked him to forgive me for hollowering at him and I wanted an apology for saying that awful thing to me, which he did.&#160; We spoke for a short time and for now on I will let go of him and give him to the Lord for he just doesn't have the grace to know what he is doing is so wrong, being a Catholic convert this is scandelous..&#160; When he was becoming a Catholic didn't he learn that Abortion was evil and certainly not accepted&#160;by the Church.&#160; What went horribly wrong?&#160; &#160;Let God deal with him from now on.&#160; Though he said that if this incident happens again with someone leaving their child or children in the car for us to let him know about it.&#160; Ironically Martha did use the mega phone to tell him but he had his music ear plugs in.&#160; Oh well.&#160; I think I'll just call the Police and let them deal with it.&#160; No need to bother Doug and his music.&#160;&#160;I gave&#160;him my card to look at RochesterProlife.org to learn about Planned Parenthood, for he thinks that it is a real good place.&#160;

Another baby has been saved at the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center on 6-13-07. A sidewalk counselor/prayer warrior &amp; I were on the street near Planned Parenthood praying &amp; holding a graphic sign when a car pulled up &amp; the gentleman said "my girlfriend is pregnant &amp; wants an abortion". I asked her if this was so &amp; she said "yes". We invited her to come into the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center for a more comfortable place to discuss this matter.

The counselors handed out about 26 packets (summer is our best time). Each packet has about 18 pamphlets of information, on many topics, geared to the women &amp; men &amp; teenagers who go into Planned Parenthood. Also a magazine called "Love Matters" &amp; a rosary &amp; referral numbers to local pregnancy centers in the area also our FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center, 2 doors down from Planned Parenthood.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We witnessed to the Planned Parenthood escorts on Saturday who walk the clients into Planned Parenthood. They don't want the clients to know the truth &amp; to receive help.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We got some honks &amp; thumbs up &amp; also the bird from some who probably have been involved in abortion, directly or indirectly. This is not judging but over the years this seems to be the case. When they get out of their car &amp; come into our faces sooner or later they admit of their involvement. We try to help them &amp; offer our prayers for them. This is the first step in their healing. Acknowledgement of the sin.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We have one person who drives bye, especially on Wednesdays and gives us 2 birds while driving with both hands off the wheel &amp; he shouts out the window with his head half out of the moving car.

I called the next day and told his boss who spoke to him regarding the incident. The boss said that he became pro-life especially after the birth of his daughter. He seemed nice I'll send him some of our info regarding Planned Parenthood which I do. Good to educate the public of the evils of Planned Parenthood.</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="4">A couple of guys got into the personal space of one of the female sidewalk counselors (who handled the situation with grace) and harassed her. Our elderly protester came over from across the street where he was witnessing &amp; spoke to the 2 young men. He asked the tall man one question "Were you involved in an abortion"? He answered "Yes", my girlfriend had had an abortion. He almost cried &amp; he received assistance from the pro-lifers. My experience, over the past 21 years of being out on the streets, is that the people who scream the loudest are in the most pain.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SILENCE_IS_ACCEPTENCE&amp;action=edit" title="SILENCE IS ACCEPTENCE" class="new"><font size="4" style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)"><strong>SILENCE IS ACCEPTENCE</strong></font></a></p><p><strong><font size="4">Through the grace of God I hope that people will understand that the pro-lifers, who are out on the sidewalk near Planned Parenthood (non constitutional buffer zone permits us Americans to stand on the sidewalk in front of the killing mill Planned Parenthood) we are behind a 15 feet buffer zone of the entrance &amp; exit of Planned Parenthood, is to save lives. The peaceful protesters are out there in all kinds of weather (though I prefer about 80 degrees all year round void of snow, wind &amp; rain). The abuse of the weather &amp; people are consent. We are out there because this is where they are murdering defenseless babies and where we can hopefully save lives!! My prayers and tears are endless for the people who made a choice for death for their children. Some of the people who drive by &amp; the neighbors &amp; businesses don't understand. Planned Parenthood is in Rochester killing Rochester's own. We care and people want to hurt us. The police reports, over the past 11 years prove that. WHERE IS THE OUTCRY!!! I sometimes I feel that I'm in "Twilight Zone" (for those who can remember) episode and it never goes to commercial. Our hearts are for helping people with the truth. If people hate us that's okay with me. We will prevail with the grace &amp; guidance of God, who is in charge.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Handed out some baby clothes from the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center to a new mom who was 2 months pregnant.

On August 28th.@ 3PM the National Organization of Women (NOW) were protesting Sen. Joseph Robach (R) in Greece, NY to demand that the NYS Legislature pass the NY State Reproductive Health and Privacy Protection Act (RHPPA) introduced by Gov. Spitzer earlier this year. The RHPPA bill would amend or repeal various statutes in the old law to ensure that the NYS protects a woman's right to choose the course of her pregnancy and to use or refuse contraceptives. Further, the law would establish a fundamental, statuary right to privacy for women in making personal reproductive decisions. Ick!! This is DANGEROUS for the pre-born baby. They want the right to kill anywhere, anytime &amp; by anybody, nothing could be worse for a woman &amp; her child. According to NOW-NYS President Marcia A. Pappas, "This bill will revise NY State's outdated abortion law, originally enacted in 1970. Because Sen. Robach is blocking passage of this bill, NOW is targeting him with the message that it is time for all legislators to be on board to protect women's health". Dear Marcia "abortion is not health care but death care to an innocent baby (person). There protest, against an unwavering Senator, was met by 12 prayerful &amp; peaceful pro-life protesters. Our prayers went up to Heaven invoking God to help, heal &amp; convert them to the truth. The pro-choice men pushed &amp; showed 3 women, myself included, on the public sidewalk. The pro-death speakers were interrupted by prayer especially the Rosary.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4">&#160;<img width="93" height="115" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/Hassellth04.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4">&#160;Sen.

I asked her if she needed any baby clothes &amp; she said "Yes" so I brought her to the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center to give her 3 month old baby girl some clothes. She was happy. She also took a packet of information with her. If she needs anything else in the future I said for her to just call the Center &amp; we will help her.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A young woman drove bye and said "thank you" &amp; I replied back "No thank you, you touched my heart" &amp; she then hollered back "This is genocide", I agreed. She is a breath of fresh air. God bless her.</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="4">A woman came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walked over to me, on the sidewalk, &amp; exclaimed that she had her daughters in there to learn sex education. I stated that they were not sex experts but sex perverts. They teach masturbation, gay sex &amp; anything goes sex. She took a packet with lots of info. When her daughters came out of Planned Parenthood they reacted to the graphic pictures of aborted babies. What an eye opener for the girls. A picture speaks a thousand words.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A woman drove by and hollered out her window that she loved abortion. I hope &amp; pray that she gets out of denial &amp; gets the help, forgiveness &amp; healing that she &amp; other post-abortive women need. Abortion makes one ugly acting.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">One of Planned Parenthood workers came out &amp; went by me as she was walking home. I asked if she would like a packet of information to take with her. She said that she already had one &amp; gave it to her son. I asked her to step out in faith &amp; trust Jesus for a new job. No excuses dear lady for you or anyone else that works at Planned Parenthoods killing clinic. We are praying for you all.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Two young girls were by their car which had some young children in it. I offered them some information but they declined. They were rude &amp; I only felt badly that they were not open to the truth or any help. I prayed the Chaplet of Mercy for them &amp; for another car which had a man sitting in it. I waited for awhile, for Tucker had already left. I broke the rule of the street, I was by myself. I was trusting in the Lord. A very young girl came out of Planned Parenthood walking very slowly &amp; painfully to the car with the two girls &amp; young children. I went on my knees &amp; stated as they drove by me "I pray that you didn't kill your baby" the girl who was sitting in the back seat gave me such a demonic look that it sent shivers up &amp; down my spine &amp; I just wanted to cry. The bondage of sin. It's frightening to behold. As I tried to calm down I looked over to the death security guard Mark, an off duty police officer, who professes to be a Christian no less. He's only fooling himself not God. He was at the side of the Buckpitt building, a business next to Planned Parenthood, practicing his golf swings. If you want to know what evil looks like come to Planned Parenthood as an observer. You might even see the devil himself.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">At the end of all of this I say my Our Father, Hail Mary &amp; Glory Be for all the people that I encountered at this time. I give it all to Jesus for I would burst if I didn't &amp; only He can help all these people with His LOVE &amp; MERCY. All I can be is His instrument &amp; a bad one I am. He takes the weak &amp; makes them strong. His grace is sufficient. I put them in my heart &amp; then give them to Jesus &amp; then He takes them &amp; puts them in His heart.

They made sure that they were careful to do a good job so that they would not get caught. Sad as this is my grandmother 2 1/2 years later was going to abort again which would have been my mother. She was talked out of it by my great grand-mother. Abortion affects everyone.

Also there was a guy in an old ambulance going to the business next to Planned Parenthood &amp; used God's name in vain at the sidewalk counselor. She didn't do or say anything to him.

The sidewalk counselor was talking to the clients going into Planned Parenthood to offer them help. A packet of information was handed out to one the girls going into Planned Parenthood for the Hip Teen Program, a paid program for teenagers affiliated with Strong Memorial Hospital. The same Hospital where they have the "Planned Parenthood Termination Clinic" on the 2nd. floor where Nancy Stanwood murders babies in the operating room on Wednesday mornings. SMH &amp; PP are in bed together. Later when I got there on the street I was told that the next door neighbor of Planned Parenthood let her dog pee on our sign of the aborted babies. I said that if a police car drives by I will flag him down, which is what happened about 15 minutes after I said that. He was on his way to another call but he said that he would call it in. So in the next 10 minutes a police car came with 2 officers in it. We proceeded to tell the officers of the neighbor when they said that they had been called because of the mega phone which was being used. He asked if we had a permit &amp; I told him that we didn't need one for we have been out here 11 years protesting this abortion mill which we have a right to do. As for the mega phone we also have a right to use that too, of course not too loudly, which is hard to determine at times. He also said that they have a choice why don't you just hand the packet out &amp; not say anything. I took a deep breath &amp; explained to him the a woman does not have a choice to kill her baby that it was dead wrong. And another thing, if we don't use our voices to call out to the girls &amp; tell them what we have how are they to know. He started to look at the difficult pictures that we had on the sidewalk &amp; turned away. He said not to block the sidewalk &amp; I explained that "We do not, people can walk by freely". Another police car came on the scene &amp; that officer was the one that was called regarding the neighbor &amp; her dogs. We told him what happened &amp; all 3 policemen walked to the neighbor's house. They stood there for about 25 minutes when one of the protesters walked across the street to walk again across the street to the policemen to tell them we were about to leave. (Remember that there is an unconditional buffer zone at Planned Parenthood &amp; we as tax paying citizens cannot utilize the whole sidewalk). We go to the 12:10 Mass at Our Lady of Victory down the street after protesting. When the sidewalk counselor came back he told me that the neighbor wouldn't answer the door &amp; the police were waiting to see if she finally would.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We pray for her &amp; all the neighbors &amp; businesses in the neighborhood for their conversion, repentance, salvation &amp; for their silence against the slaughter of the unborn, right under their noises.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wednesday_evening_September_5%2C_2007_in_front_of_Planned_Parenthood&amp;action=edit" title="Wednesday evening September 5, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood" class="new"><strong><font size="4">Wednesday evening September 5, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></a></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><center><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=3817675962.jpg" title="Image:3817675962.jpg" class="new"><strong><font size="4"><img width="125" height="73" src="/Portals/0/protest_pics/3757244784.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></a></center><p><strong><font size="4">We had two female sidewalk counselors gracing the sidewalk near Planned Parenthood's killing mill tonight.

The first incident was a gentleman approached one of the male sidewalk counselors &amp; started to yell at him regarding the difficult pictures that we show on the sidewalk. This is the reality of abortion &amp; if people don't see it then they don't know what abortion really is. Abortion is the violent dismembering of the body of a human being thus taking his or her life. The gentleman stated that the picture he was holding upset his child in the car. We have found over the years of being on the street that this really isn't true. The adults are bothered by the picture &amp; blame it on their child. Young children have no concept of what they just saw, as their parent or parents drove by us but the parents do. By the reaction of the parent the child reacts to the upset parent. One child once said "who broke the baby". At the end of the brief conversation the sidewalk counselor &amp; the gentleman shook hands. He stated that he lived in the neighborhood &amp; wrote for a local newspaper I challenge him to pray &amp; protest Planned Parenthood too. Why would you want, as your neighbor, someone who murders children for money. We get upset, as we should, if a child predator moves into your neighborhood but do nothing when it comes to people killing babies down the street.

Planned Parenthood has its Rape Counseling in the same building that it kills babies. They don't care about babies or rape victims.

How selfish of the parents. Easy way out, I don't think so. I am sure that the relationship between mother and daughter will never be the same again.

Most of the girls took a "truth packet" going into Planned Parenthood but came out without them. I gave one of the girls another packet &amp; told her to share with her friends. Planned Parenthood doe not want girls or anyone to know the truth. The truth is bad for business. One of the girls when looking at the graphic pictures of aborted babies that we use to tell the truth said "Planned Parenthood told them it was nothing". It's easy to kill nothing but a baby is different. One time a young girl came out of there and looked at the picture and said that Planned Parenthood told her that "it was nothing" &amp; went ahead with the abortion only to find out that it wasn't nothing, it was her baby. She cried and we told her to call Project Rachel at 800/972-2435 a post abortion help line. So many girls have been lied to and deceived at Planned Parenthood. How they demoralize a human being by saying that he or she is nothing making it easier to kill. We profilers pick up the shattered pieces of people that made the awful decision to have their baby aborted by Planned Parenthood. I invited two girls that came out of Planned Parenthood, to the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center for a DVD on the illustrated bloodless abortion procedure and one on ultrasound. We had a good talk and they took some of the literature that we have. We stress to young people to wait to have sex until marriage &amp; they agreed. They asked many questions &amp; were opened to the truth. Two less girls to worry about. God will guide them on their journey in life.

In all my 21 years protesting on the street I've never seen any tears just rude jesters when showing the signs. Some people have shown some compassion &amp; interest but I've never really seen real tears before. She's one in a million. What a difference one person can make. She really touched my heart &amp; I'll never forget her. She gave me hope. This "special" lady had a heart for this unborn baby that was brutally murdered by abortion.

The next door neighbor of Planned Parenthood Cathy her step son came to see his step mom tonight. I haven't seen him in about 2 years since he "mooned" me on the sidewalk. I called the police &amp; had a warrant out for his arrest to which he did have to appear in court. The Judge stated that he was supposed to be 1,000 feet from me, on the sidewalk. Only after going to court he came right back that very same night when I was on the street. The police said because the judge didn't put it in writing that they couldn't do anything about it. So just a warning that if you go to court make sure that whatever the Judge says that he or she puts it in writing otherwise it's a no go. Who would think? I hope that he learned his lesson though.

She jarrated her body &amp; went into Planned Parenthood. When she came out &amp; was driving out of Planned Parenthood I said to her that "You're going no where but going around &amp; around chasing your tail" to which she gave me the finger gesture &amp; started to jarrated again. I said that "Don't show me your IQ but REPENT". She must have known what I meant because she reacted to it. You go around &amp; around when you sin you really don't go anywhere. I know she is not happy with her life. We really worry about the girls that don't react because they are in a bad place for they have deadened their hearts.

They deceive the girls and they don't even know what is happening to them as they walk into the 'death building'. They come together to find more ways to murder defenseless babies. There was Silva Rose, who likes to garden at Planned Parenthood, would you believe. She cares more about flowers that she does about human life. Ick. Then there is Barry Whitehead, a teacher at the School Without Walls, if he's still there. Poor students. One third of their classmates aren't there because of abortion.

He once had a sign on his car which read "I'm a pro-choice father of an adopted daughter" why is this guy not pro-life? Look what this woman gave him, her daughter, which sorry to say that she could have aborted. His adopted daughter wouldn't be in his life if the mother didn't choose life.

Killing babies at Planned Parenthood today. A lot of abuse from the people going into this "place of death". Our elderly male pro-lifer, who just turned 78 said to a woman coming out of Planned Parenthood "choose life" and she answered back "I just had an abortion" &amp; ran off. One car driving by said to the sidewalk counselor "go back to Iran". I guess he thinks that there is freedom in killing one's own baby. He made a U turn up the street came back pass the counselor hollering the same thing to which she replied "I have your license plate number". She didn't see him again. A woman with a suit on was walking into Planned Parenthood with a young girl. Could this woman be a 'social worker'? Nothing like ruining one's life. The young girl kept on looking at the pictures. Was the apparent social worker bringing this young girl in for an abortion? She did this girl such a disservice. Poor girl! The sidewalk counselor offered her help but the woman with suit lead her in the "place of death". There was a young guy waiting in the car &amp; on his car was a black &amp; white flag with a skulls head. He gave the counselor two birds at once with his hands going up &amp; down. Guilty conscious maybe. We hope &amp; pray that they all repent &amp; get love &amp; mercy &amp; forgiveness from the dear Lord who is so greatly offended by their sins. We've noticed that many of the workers at Planned Parenthood are having rosaries on their car mirrors. Maybe they think that if they have a rosary in their car that maybe what they're doing working at Planned Parenthood is okay. Twisted thinking or maybe that their conscious is starting to bother them. I once said to the workers "you praise God on Sunday then kill His children on Monday". Planned Parenthood is now using spirituality in the murdering of God's innocent babies. How sick. Three young people in a car drove into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood &amp; just kept on looking at the graphic pictures. They didn't get out &amp; drove away. Could that have been a 'save'? I certainly hope so.

I walked over to him &amp; said “Hello Mr. Gantt how are you tonight”. I had the invitation paper in my hands &amp; was trying to hand it to him. He said to me "I told you that I don't want any of this". He thought that I was trying to give him some information that would educate him about what Planned Parenthood is doing to the Black race right down the street from his office. They're killing off the Black race &amp; Mr. Gantt doesn’t want to know anything about it. So I said to him "I'm inviting you to a talk to be given by Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, he's going to speak at the FOCUS Pregnancy Center on Monday. No, No, No he replied back. I then said "we're trying to save your race down the street in front of Planned Parenthood". He then replied "No White person has ever helped any Black person". Wow, I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS! I never really knew of a Black person, let alone an Assemblyman, to be prejudice against the White race. I guess anyone can be prejudice no matter what color their skin is. He then coughed up a big spit ball &amp; then spited it out right in front of the restaurant where he was going into. I know after that, I might have trouble eating later. Thanks Mr. Gantt how discussing. How evil acting of you Mr. Gantt, for being closed minded &amp; helping to kill off your Black race at Planned Parenthood by not speaking up against abortion.

A young woman came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; told me that she was a pro-choice &amp; was adopted. I then replied "you are not pro-choice but pro-death that in your choice a baby dies &amp; how come you're not pro-life? She screamed back I hate my .... mother. I can't put on the web site what she called her biological mother. I then replied "Forgive her, she could have had you killed you but she gave you up to your adoptive parents". Then I told her my story briefly. But what really was closer to her experience was that in my own family my older sister was raped by knife point, in her own apartment, in 1975 &amp; conceived. The so-called doctor in the Emergency Room told her to go for an abortion but she said "No'" &amp; had her baby girl. The baby girl grew up to hate her biological mother. I have said to her "forgive her for whatever you don't like about her because she gave you life &amp; she could have had you killed". She won't be free just like this young girl won't be free until they both forgive their 1st mothers for whatever reason that they have in their hearts against them.</font></strong></p><p><br /><font size="4" color="#800000"><strong>Counseling of Children of Rape</strong></font></p><p><a href="http://www.christiansurvivors.com/childcounselling.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.christiansurvivors.com/childcounselling.html" class="external free"><strong>http://www.christiansurvivors.com/childcounselling.html</strong></a></p><p><br /><font size="4" color="#800000"><strong>Bethany Adoption Agency</strong></font></p><p><a href="http://www.bethany.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bethany.org/" class="external free"><strong>http://www.bethany.org/</strong></a></p><p><strong>&#160;&#160;</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thursday_afternoon_October_4%2C_2007_in_front_of_Planned_Parenthood&amp;action=edit" title="Thursday afternoon October 4, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood" class="new"><font size="4"><strong>Thursday afternoon October 4, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></a></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;From 10AM to 12NOON in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p><p><br /><font size="4"><strong>It went pretty well, I think.

When I arrived around 4:00 p.m. there were four young people waiting inside the Focus Pregnancy Center to speak to someone. They had left Planned Parenthood after waiting for awhile for a pregnancy test. They were nervous and I didn't get the whole story for awhile so I began to show them a videotape that shows the true horrors of abortion. The young man and one of the young woman in the group then told me that they believed that the young woman was pregnant. They told me the high schools that they attended and they commended a Churchville Chili health teacher who had spoken strongly against abortion. I connected them up with another area pregnancy center. I reminded them that if she was pregnant, she was already a Mom and he a Dad- abortion doesn't reverse that. I told them that they had made a mistake but not to make it worse by abortion. I also told them that while they might not be old enough to raise their child, they could give the child up for adoption so that someone else could. Fortunately, both of these young people said that their parents were aware of the situation and were somewhat supportive. My prayers are with them that they have the strength in this difficult situation, if the pregnancy is confirmed, to allow their child to enter the world. All through this situation, even though it took me by surprise, I felt the hand of God and a sense of peace and I truly believe that this young couple is going to do what is right. I gave six 'Truth packets' out this evening .

My partner &amp; I ventured to Seneca Falls to protest Planned Parenthood's VOX Conference (which meams Voice in Latin). I don't know whose Voice they are talking about because it sure isn't the voice of the unborn or most Americans in regards to abortion. This is a group that targets the college age females to indoctrinate them to Planned Parenthood's way of thinking, which is sick. This is VOX, in Planned Parenthood's own words. [[Vox: Voices for Planned Parenthood is a program to educate and mobilize students and youth in support of reproductive health and rights. Vox groups across the country organize public events, educate their peers, support their local Planned Parenthood health centers, and mobilize students and other young people to speak out for reproductive rights and access to reproductive health services. Vox members get involved! We organize and let politicians know that our reproductive choices are important to us and must be protected. Join us!]] I hope NOT. Well, I can say that my partner &amp; I sort of joined them today but in a way that they didn't like. We went to the Holiday Inn, in Seneca Falls, &amp; protested their VOX Conference, to which we think 12 misguided women showed up for. We were at the entrance, of the Inn, showing Reproductive Rights graphic pictures of aborted babies. Why were they so upset? Isn't this what they are fighting for? To be be able to do this to their baby? How confusing! The Managers of the Holiday Inn came out &amp; told my partner to move off the grass because he was their property. He told them it was the imp easement &amp; not their property. I said that we were here because of Planned Parenthood. To which the female Manager replied that I had my opinion &amp; they had theirs. To which I replied that I do hope that you will not have them back here next year to collect more 'Blood Money'. My partner then said "Next year, if you do, we'll have 10 more people with us". Then the male worker then said "You just made a threat, you just threatened us" to which I snickered &amp; said "A threat is when one threatens ones personhood by stating to cause harm or death to that person". That's not what was said. They both then just walked away back into the Inn. The people driving bye were mostly unresponsive, I feel that's because they mostly were in shock. The average person doesn't know what 'Baby Killing' looks like. They've been told that it is just a clump of tissue &amp; if you don't want it in your body an longer you can just go to Planned Parenthood or an abortionist to get it scraped out. WHAT A LIE! If you are pregnant then you are going to have a 'baby' not a clump of tissue. A grandfather, driving bye, gave us the 'bird' as his granddaughter was looking at the pictures out her window. How sad of you Grandpa, it's a good thing that she didn't see you do that. A VOX girl pulled in the Holiday Inn driveway for the conference &amp; gave me the 'bird' to which I replied "Repent, Hell is forever". A car with 3 people pulled out of the driveway from Ontario &amp; was very receptive to what we were doing out there. I went over to them &amp; gave them a 'Truth packet' to which they said "Thank you" &amp; left. Wow! The non Americans was the most friendly. I said to them "Thank you".</font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="4">A man was walking on the property of the Holiday Inn &amp; came over to us when I said to the girls going in the hotel that Planned Parenthood kills babies &amp; doesn't care about you. He then came right over &amp; said "Not only are you showing propaganda but speaking it too". He also said in regards to the graphic pictures that these were not embryos". I asked if he had been involved in an abortion &amp; he stated he absolutely had". My partner talked mostly to him but the conversation just went around &amp; around &amp; around. He said that he was a Psychiatrist &amp; treated children. How ironic. We talked to him for a long time &amp; he just didn't want to put any personhood to these children, in the womb. I then showed him my little plastic 10 week old baby &amp; his attitude then changed. I think that the good Lord touched his heart. He shook my partner's hand &amp; I went over to shake his. I asked him his name &amp; gave him ours. We will be praying for his continual healing, conversion &amp; reparation for his sin of abortion &amp; that he will ask Jesus to forgive him, which He will.

The Sergeant even said that we had a right to the grass to where the pole was. He even preferred it for 'our safety'. I don't believe it! Someone who cares about us. I just want to thank Sergeant Kelly &amp; his partner (I didn't get his name &amp; I apologize for that. My partner &amp; I prayed for pro-life police &amp; God answered our prayers.

I felt like saying "No, you are not okay if you came out of PP" but I didn't. I felt that I needed to be real gentle with them.

I started to say “Get away from us, Go”, for they are a threat to our ministry. Then I found that Barry Whitehead was in my face, he had crossed over yellow line. He was confronting me with his body. I felt like they were coming over to kidnap this young girl. She walked with them into Planned Parenthood. The trauma I felt as this evil acing man was in my face brought back the some of the traumas I experienced in my past. These people are evil acting. They act as accomplices to the murders which take place in Planned Parenthood. They are the ones who drive the get away car in a bank robbery they are still guilty of the crime which was committed in the bank. My heart was raising &amp; I felt sick to my stomach. The only consolation was that the young girl wasn’t going there for an abortion or for birth control. I t hen called the police. The 911 operator was rude. I told her about the incident &amp; she asked me what they were wearing &amp; when I told her that they were wearing aprons that read Planned Parenthood on them she then said “What are you saying that they have no pants on”. O boy! I told her t hat they cover their clothing or coats with the blue PP apron. She then said that she would send a police car to the scene. I had witnesses which saw it all. Two police cars arrived about 10 minutes later. Both officers got out of their cars &amp; one walked over to me. As this was happening, the Catholic retired police officer / security guard of Planned Parenthood (Doug Salisbury) got out of his car &amp; walked over to the second policeman with a smirk on his betrayal face. I explained the incident to the officer &amp; he then asked me some questions to which I replied. He then walked away from me &amp; headed towards the other 2 men. He came back with the same attitude &amp; said that no arrests will be made. I wanted to talk with him some more but he walked away. The officers never spoke with the other sidewalk counselor who was also there for this incident &amp; neither officers spoke with the 2 death escorts who got in our faces. How do you say, I feel the bias. As he was walking away the other sidewalk counselor said to him “Have a blessed day, we will be praying for you”.

Last weeks Catholic retired police officer Doug, wasn't there today.

I asked the Pastor to speak to him &amp; I will follow through on this. I also told the new death escorts that they are not to come to the sidewalk &amp; get in our faces. I think that they agreed. I also said that the incident with the 2 death escorts that got in the 2 sidewalk counselors faces, last week, was not finished by a long shot. I received a letter from a Lawyer that stated: "The police are trying very hard to fight violent crime in the City &amp; therefore should not be acting as a private security force for a very wealthy, private enterprise. If this situation had been reversed &amp; you &amp; another protester had either interfered with the escorts, even if that protester had not gotten in anyone's face, we all know that the protester would have been arrested.

This occurred at 12:30 AM when I &amp; six gentlemen were out, in front of Planned Parenthood, to pray from 12 midnight to 1AM. We all were saying the rosary when a middle aged woman came out of the side street onto University Ave. She walked right up to me &amp; asked what this was all about. I said that we were praying to end abortion. She then said "It was okay if it was from a rape". I said "No it was not". She said that she had been raped &amp; had an abortion but she was forgiven. Then I asked her if she was truly sorry for the abortion. She said that she was not. I said to her that she was not forgiven, for she had to be truly sorry for taking a life. She said that she was raped, that it wasn't consensual. I said that it wasn't your fault but it wasn't the fault of the baby either to be conceived &amp; that the baby shouldn't die for the violent crime of the father. I said that he should be jail to which she replied that he was. She got very angry at me but took a Rosary &amp; thanked me for it. I stressed that she would be forgiven of her sin if she confessed it with a sincere heart. People don't realize the seriousness of this sin against God &amp; upon ones own soul. Remember that this little person didn't ask to be conceived but the Good Lord allowed it &amp; that is enough for me. A woman can't get over a rape but in time it isn't as painful anymore but she can never get over an abortion, which is painful all the time. This woman was also in prison, in her mind, for what she had done to her baby. Yes, even in a rape this little person who is there now is hers too not totally the rapist. It's not the victim nor the baby's fault. Adoption is an option never abortion. A life is a life is a life. We cannot play God. God didn't say life was going to be easy only that He would be with us through it all Trust in Him.</strong></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;</strong></font></p><font size="4"><strong><hr /></strong></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>Monday</strong></font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saturday_morning_November_3%2C_2007_in_front_of_Planned_Parenthood&amp;action=edit" title="Saturday morning November 3, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood" class="new"><font size="4"><strong> November 5, 2007 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></a></p><p><font size="4"><strong>&#160;<br />

said to him that he would be a 'Life Saver' if he would give her the packet.&#160; He said that he would, for thank God, he new abortion was the killing of a baby.&#160;He said that he gave her the packet and she looked at it and cried.&#160;&#160;She probably&#160;saw the Growth &amp; Development pictures of her baby.&#160;I&#160;and the other pro lifers were so happy to hear this exciting news.&#160;&#160;He said that he told her to stop bye some time and thank us.&#160; I said "No, thank you for&#160;giving her the packet and God bless you and we'd love to&#160;meet his niece sometime.&#160;We were so happy to find out that a precious baby will be 'born' and not 'killed'&#160;through the loving efforts of an uncle.&#160; What a 'special' man you are sir.&#160; God bless you and your family.&#160; Wish that there was more like him.&#160;This is why we are out there on the streets is to help save lives of both Mother and Child.</strong></font></p><p align="center"><font size="4"><strong><img width="128" height="96" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/littlebabysleeping.jpg" alt="" /></strong></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>As I was talking with this gentleman I heard a loud voice behind me.&#160; &#160;What had happened was the other female sidewalk counselor was offering a 'Truth' packet to a young girl who had just came out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She was walking over to the sidewalk to accept it which she did and then throw it right at the counselor hitting her in the elbow.&#160; The girl was screaming at her and then walked up the street towards Main St.&#160; I then was&#160;aware of which just happened and hollered to the girl that she was just too angry and for her to repent (which means to change ones life&#160;by asking God to forgive our sins and not to repeat that sin again by asking for&#160;God's help and grace to conquer it).&#160;&#160;After that we had a very angry street person come bye and just stand there and scream at us for about 5 minutes straight.&#160;&#160;I said "Hi" to him for I knew him and he just screamed some more.&#160; I was ready to call&#160;911 if I had to for he&#160;was unpredictable&#160;and we need to be protected when we are out there.&#160; What really happened was he has&#160;come bye for years and we would talk with him and give him food.&#160; Then one day when one of the other female sidewalk counselor was out on the sidewalk, on Thursday, and she was counseling some girls, he came bye and was disturbing her with gross behavior and was disturbing the scene.&#160; She told me about&#160;his bad behavior and when I saw him again I said to him not to do that again.&#160; He&#160;called me a name and walked away talking loudly and really hasn't been back as much since.&#160; But for the last two times, he walked down the street, he just starts&#160;screaming.&#160; We love you but you are still responsible for your behavior.&#160;&#160;&#160;</strong></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>After we side walked counseled Martha &amp;

Then a car came in with a woman and her 2 young children probably around&#160;5 and&#160;6 years of age.&#160;&#160;We called out to her when she left the car alone with her 2 children in the car with the mortor running.&#160; I said that if she didn't gert her kids out of the car I would call the Police.&#160; When she came out abbout 1/2 hour later I told her that I was going to call the Police after I got her License #, which I did.&#160; Martha helped me &amp; we called the Police and asked for a car to come for a Report.&#160; In the meantime, the&#160;Death Security Guard, Doug Salisbury, poped his head out the window and I screamed to him not to get out of&#160;his car when the Police come, to which he said something in return I cannot repeat on my web site.&#160; It was very icky and&#160;I can tell you that and no gentleman would ever said that to a Lady.&#160; But again look where he works and who he gets his $ from. &#160;It figures, though how sad!!&#160;&#160; There was an incident about 2 months ago when I called the Police on the 2 Death Escorts who approached us 2 pro lifers on the sidewalk and where in our faces, as we were talking to a youg girl who had, walked bye.&#160; When the Police came, Doug Salisbury came out of his car and approached the Police and spoke with him.&#160; The Police should have spoke with the 2 Death Escorts instead of the Death Security Guard, for it was about them and not him.&#160; I just didn't want him to interfer with this situation.&#160; He was once a Police Officer about 7 years ago and when I call the Police I don't want the situation to be biased.&#160; He then moved his car closer to me where I was standing on the sidewalk.&#160; He said that people laugh at me &#160;for my hollowering at them and I replied that "They are killing babies in there and you&#160;should be upset by that and so should they".&#160; Imagine being calm as children are being murdered.&#160; It is Politically Correct to accet this atrosity and not be upset.&#160; Numbing of Americans of the murdering of it's children.&#160; Not&#160; just American children but God's children who He created.&#160; How dare he.&#160;&#160; I saw the Police car coming down the street and I stopped him by the&#160;Strip&#160; Mall anf in fron of Planed Parenthood. &#160; I told him of the situation of the mother and 2 children and he unfortatuntaly told me that there was no law against children left alone in the car though when a car is running then it would be considered 'Child Endargerment' and then a ticket could be issued.&#160;This was bad parenting for sure he said. &#160;So next time a car comes in and the mother leaves her&#160;young child or&#160;children in the car alone with the car running then I will call the Police ASAP before I get the License #.&#160; After Officer Henry left I spoke with Doug the Death Security Guard again.&#160; I asked him to forgive me for hollowering at him and I wanted an apology for saying that awful thing to me, which he did.&#160; We spoke for a short time and for now on I will let go of him and give him to the Lord for he just doesn't have the grace to know what he is doing is so wrong, being a Catholic convert this is scandelous..&#160; When he was becoming a Catholic didn't he learn that Abortion was evil and certainly not accepted&#160;by the Church.&#160; What went horribly wrong?&#160; &#160;Let God deal with him from now on.&#160; Though he said that if this incident happens again with someone leaving their child or children in the car for us to let him know about it.&#160; Ironically Martha did use the mega phone to tell him but he had his music ear plugs in.&#160; Oh well.&#160; I think I'll just call the Police and let them deal with it.&#160; No need to bother Doug and his music.&#160;&#160;I gave&#160;him my card to look at RochesterProlife.org to learn about Planned Parenthood, for he thinks that it is a real good place.&#160;
