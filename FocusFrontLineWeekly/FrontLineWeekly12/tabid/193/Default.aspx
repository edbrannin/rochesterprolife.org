Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>When we all arrived at the center after Mass we got right to work putting things away&#160;from all the donations that we've been receiving in the last week or so.&#160; So there was Martha, Paul &amp; then the doorbell rang &amp; now it was Carole too.&#160; I went off to the office &amp; made up Truth packets &amp; did office work, while everyone else worked to get the Great Room emptied out for the second Mass of 2011 that will be celebrated at 6:30pm tonight by Fr. Brain Carpenter from Peace of Christ Parish.&#160; He will also bless water &amp; salt so that we can use these Sacramentals against the enemy at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Will also will have a pot luck supper after Suzanne, our Thursday, Client Advocate,&#160;gives her personal testimony which will be after the Mass tonight.&#160; So we needed to keep busy to make it in time, for once we've cleared all the donations out of the Great Room, then we have to set up for the Mass &amp; get the altar ready &amp; to set up the tables for the supper &amp; put the chairs in the room for our guests, for the Mass.&#160; Must to do &amp; time was a going but we made it.&#160; It was now 6:00 &amp; the doorbell was ringing &amp; people were coming in.&#160; Martha had worked hard getting the tables ready &amp; the food &amp; beverages for later.&#160; I was greeting the people.&#160; One couple came in while I was brushing my teeth, how embarrassing.&#160; Fr. Brain arrived at 6:30pm but he didn't have the readings with him&#160;so he came into my office to obtain them on the web.&#160; My computer gave him a hard time &amp; it took longer than he wanted it to take but finally&#160;he got the readings &amp; made a copy of them&#160;&amp; all was well &amp; the Mass got started.&#160; I always sit in the back so I can hear the doorbell ring for the late comers so when I have to get up that I won't disturb anyone.&#160; Tonight because we started so late there were no late comers for all were there to attend the Mass. There were&#160;three new faces, which was great to see, &amp; some people that I haven't seen in awhile were there too. The Mass got started &amp; It was beautiful.&#160; Fr. Brain gave a memorable homily, which brought tears to my eyes.&#160; After the Mass I introduced Suzanne &amp; she gave her personal testimony, her journey&#160;back to the Catholic Church.&#160; It was now around 8pm &amp; I remember that I didn't hear the doorbell ring or anything like that but I got up from my chair&#160;&amp; walked into the hallway, to which I saw two young girls &amp; a child, around 3 years old.&#160; I didn't hear the doorbell&#160;so&#160;the taxi guy must have let them into the building.&#160; I asked what could I do for them &amp; the&#160;two girls asked for a pregnancy test.&#160; I can't believe I said this but&#160;I told&#160;them that we were closed, maybe it was because I didn't want&#160;them think that we stay open every day at this late hour.&#160; I then said "okay' but first would you follow me into a room where someone is giving her testimony &amp; then after that you will get your pregnancy test.&#160; They said "okay" &amp; they all followed me into the Great Room where Suzanne was giving her testimony.&#160; I was hoping that after her talk&#160;she would give the girls the pregnancy tests but that didn't work out the way I had&#160;planned.&#160; The girls were getting&#160;anxious, with the little boy, who was really well be haved,&#160;but I didn't want them to leave before they got the tests so I went over&#160;to where Martha was sitting &amp; asked her if she would do two pregnancy tests, for me.&#160; She looked at me with a surprised look on her face, for she was listening to the testimony &amp; didn't expect doing a pregnancy test tonight&#160;but said "yes" &amp; got up from her chair.&#160; I explained the situation to her quickly.&#160; She brought&#160;one girl at a time, into the Rose Room/ Pregnancy Testing Room,&#160;while the other girl was in the Material Aid Room with the little boy, getting some things for him.&#160; They were at Focus for about 20 minutes &amp; were not pregnant but one of the girls had&#160;had an abortion, in the past, so Martha ministered to her &amp; gave her some post abortive brochures &amp; helpful numbers to call&#160;for her to&#160;get the help that she needed.&#160; I was happy that they received the&#160;assistance that they&#160;needed &amp; the little boy got some nice things too.&#160;&#160;After they left Suzanne was finished with her talk &amp; the people were gathering to the tables that were set up in the All Purpose Room&#160;to dig into the food that was brought for our meal.&#160; Fr. Brain did the blessing &amp; we all started to eat.&#160; I got to meet two out of the three new people that came &amp; I found them quite interesting to say the least.&#160; I would&#160;like for them to come &amp;&#160;give their personal testimonies after our next Mass.&#160; One of the woman is a convert to the Catholic Church from the Universalist/Unitarian Church "for nothing is impossible with God".&#160; Also, she was pregnant out of wedlock &amp; 'chose life' for her precious child who is 13 years old now.&#160; The other woman was from Hawaii &amp; had an interesting testimony too.&#160; What a marvelous evening.&#160; After much food &amp; great conversation I asked Father to bless the water &amp; the salt.&#160; He got his Book of Blessings out &amp; we all stood in a semi circle to listen to the words of the blessings.&#160; It was wonderful &amp; such a blessing to all of us who were Catholics.&#160; Then Fr. Brain went to every room of the center to bless it with the Holy Water that he just blessed.&#160; It was an awesome event.&#160; After that we all continued to share &amp; eat some more.&#160; After mostly everyone had left except Martha, Paul, Suzanne &amp; Rob I asked Fr. Brain to hear my Confession &amp; to administer the Sacrament of the Sick to me because of my chronic health problems &amp; pain &amp; discomfort.&#160; We went into the Rose Room for the Sacraments to be given.&#160; After that we talked about the chronic abdominal pain that I have had all my life &amp; how to pray to God about it.&#160; He was so kind &amp; helpful.&#160; He left late only to have to get up early the next morning to celebrate Mass in his parish.&#160; I said "good bye &amp; thank you so much Fr. Brian for blessing us tonight".&#160; He said he had a blessed evening too.&#160; God is Great!!&#160; </strong></span></span></p><hr /><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">Thursday, July 7, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">This is Sheila's experiences on the front lines</font></strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">When Dennis, my brother,&#160;and I arrived Pat and Bill were there.

A man drove up because his wife asked him to get a rosary for his daughter. She had stopped previously and received a packet and rosaries for two of their children. He took one for himself also.

A woman and her daughter came out of&#160; PP and pulled over in their car. They were there for rape crisis counseling.&#160; She went there originally because she didn’t have insurance. They helped her get some. Now she can go somewhere else, rather than support a place that is in the business of abortion. I gave her a truth packet and a list of good places to go for counseling. Hopefully this will prevent PP from ensnaring her and her young daughter .When they need other types of support they will be in&#160; touch with people who&#160; will steer them in the right direction. They are Catholic, and will pray the rosary for our success.</font></strong></span></span></div><div><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial"><br />
An abortion minded woman arrived at PP in a taxi.&#160; I called out telling her of our Center down the street. She came back out within five minutes. She walked past us, telling me to mind my own business. I walked with her, urging her to let us help her and when we got to the Focus parking lot, Mary J. was there. The woman did listen to Mary’s counseling.&#160; She left, still angry, but I think Mary touched her heart.&#160; Mary’s main point was that this baby is a precious gift from God, given especially to her and to no one else. God picked her to be the mother of this child. </font></strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">Rachel Phelps was not there, but abortions were definitely going on. </font></strong></span></span></div><div><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial"><br />

giving out children clothes &amp; small items.&#160; When I arrived at the center I got out of the car &amp; saw that Sheila was talking to a woman on the sidewalk by the parking lot.&#160; I debated&#160; if I should go over there &amp; but in but I was lead by the Holy Spirit to walk over to where they both were standing.&#160; I stood there looking at Sheila &amp; then the woman &amp; say "hi'.&#160; Then Sheila said&#160;to me "I think that she is considering abortion".&#160; I almost swallowed my tongue but I said "no, why&#160; do want to have your baby killed".&#160; She said that she has a child at home &amp; has had an abortion in the past &amp; it really didn't bother me &amp; I can't afford another baby &amp; besides God understand &amp; He forgives".&#160; I looked right at her &amp; her head was down &amp; said with firmness "no God does not understand for He said "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160; She was visibly upset &amp; as she was walking down the street, for now I had walked to the door of the center &amp; Sheila was still standing on the sidewalk, &amp; she was screaming as she was walking down the sidewalk saying "I'll be praying for you".&#160; I walked back over to where Sheila was standing &amp; we talked about this event, for a few minutes.&#160; She said that I handled it very well &amp; I gave all the Glory to God, for He had me there at that particular&#160;time to say what He wanted me to say.&#160; I'm not saying that&#160;God wasn't using Sheila for He sure was.&#160; She was the one that planted the seed &amp; I just watered it.&#160;This situation was upsetting to us to say the least.&#160; It's hard to hear a mother say that she was getting ready to have her baby killed &amp; she thinks that God doesn't mind if she does it either.&#160; Wow, that's heavy!!&#160; Sheila went back to the front lines &amp; I went into the center where Martha was getting the signs &amp; mega phone &amp; literature box to go out on the front lines.&#160; There was Bill pulling into&#160;our parking lot.&#160; Yeah, he got here today, I'm glad that I told him on the phone the other day, to go a different way to get to the center where there&#160;wasn't much street work with detours, which was confusing to Bill who is 82 years old.&#160; He is faithful on the front lines &amp; has been with Rob &amp; I for the last 15 years, witnessing to the people going in &amp; coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; He is on the other side of the street &amp; he hollers over to the people in the cars when they get out saying "choose life, your mother did".&#160; You go Bill!!!&#160;&#160; </strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>As I was leaving to go out to the front lines Sheila &amp;

I hopefully will see them next week for when I finally went to the sidewalk they were gone.&#160; I got to talk to Sheila for a few minutes &amp; I told her that I would call her next week to 'catch up' with what went on earlier today.&#160; We briefly discussed the woman that we talked to earlier our on the sidewalk &amp; will keep her in our prayers.&#160; Later on I will request prayer to the Focus email list &amp; Prayer Warriors.&#160; I feel because she protested to much that she got convicted by the Holy Sprit not to&#160;have another abortion.&#160; Please read Isaiah 55:11&#160; "So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding <i>in the matter</i> for which I sent it."&#160; I will be encouraged with what God just did in letting this woman know that abortion is not what God wants her to do &amp; it does not please God &amp; He doesn't understand.&#160; He says to "Trust in Him".&#160; She will be in our prayers that's for sure.&#160; Sheila &amp; her brother had to leave &amp; I said "thank you &amp;

even cleaned up vomit in the hallway.&#160; A&#160; little girl &amp; her mom were so tried &amp; hot when they came in looking for bus money to get home.&#160; I gave them each a bottle of water&#160;&amp; the little girl, who was about 4 years old, upchucked.&#160; I think that she was so upset &amp; tired &amp; probably a little dehydrated too.&#160; I finally joined Martha out on the front lines &amp;

the signs were flying all over the place.&#160; I went back into the center to get the literature box &amp; the other mega phone too.&#160; It was one event after another even if we got out there late today.&#160; We had a man just stand &amp; stare at us on the other side of the street.&#160; I think that he's a neighbor who lives off of Gibb's St. &amp; he does think that we make to much noise.&#160; Just like everyone else sir in the good old summertime, just come on down to my street in East Rochester.&#160; Well I just surmise that was what he was thinking but I don't really know for sure because all he did was stand there &amp; stare at Martha &amp; I.&#160; I said something to me at one point &amp; then just thought it was a waste of time so I didn't say anything else to him again.&#160; He finally left &amp; he turned around when I said, without the mega phone, "repent" to someone coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Maybe he thought I was saying that to him, for him to turn around.&#160;

I asked Martha If she wanted to do it or did she want me to do it &amp; she said that she would do it.&#160; I introduced the women to Martha &amp; off they went into the center for the tests.&#160; A few minutes later the woman who was on the funny bike stopped on the sidewalk &amp; said that she would like to ask me a question.&#160; I said I remember you from last year, you stopped &amp; I spoke to you then.&#160; I said a fast prayer to the Holy Spirit for wisdom for&#160;I had a feeling that this was going to be different.&#160; I was right.&#160; She asked me a question to which I really don't remember what it was but I answered it to the best of my ability.&#160; I knew that she wasn't trying to be nasty or difficult but she was very confused about many things that was disturbing.&#160; We talked for awhile &amp; then Martha had now joined us in conversation as she was praying her Rosary.&#160; This woman didn't believe in God only in neutrons &amp; neurons &amp; cellular combustion etc. &amp; everything was all right to do, it seemed.&#160; She was nice &amp; likable to say the least.&#160; I asked her name &amp; she said that didn't like the name her mother gave her so she had it changed but she didn't give it to me.&#160; I told her that faith was a gift &amp; that I would pray that she would receive it.&#160; She replied "please don't bother".&#160; As we talked more &amp; Martha also added to the discussion she said that she had to go &amp; as she was leaving I said "good bye &amp; my name is Mary".&#160; She said "good bye Mary" &amp; off she went up the street on her funny bicycle .&#160; Martha then prayed, in agreement for the Lord to give her the gift of Faith &amp; I put her into my heart &amp; then I gave her to the Blessed Mother to put into her Immaculate Heart &amp; asked her to put her into the Sacred Heart of her son Jesus.&#160; I felt that now she was well taken care of &amp;

I was standing by the fence while Martha was praying the Divine Mercy prayer on her Rosary beads, I was talking to a car with some females in it.&#160; I said what Planned Parenthood does in there &amp; that we can help them &amp; talked about sin &amp; the like.&#160; All of a sudden the one woman got out of the van &amp; went over to the trunk &amp; then&#160;pulled her dress up for me to see her naked butt.&#160; I was surprised to say the least because it's usually the guys that do that kind of thing,&#160;not the females.&#160; I was nasty unfortunately, for I said to her that her buns needed to be firmed up a bit &amp; she had some cellulite to work on.&#160; I guess I said that because I didn't want her to think that it rattled me.&#160; I also told her that I have called the police on people that have done what she just did &amp; one was arrested &amp; had to go to court.&#160; Well that didn't phase her in the least because she did it again only faster this time around.&#160; It was sad to me that she disrespected herself that much that she would pull up he skirt to show me her derriere without decent underwear on.&#160; Icky to talk about this on the web page,&#160;and I do apologize if&#160;this does offend anyone, for this is the reality of bad behavior at an abortion mill.&#160; As they were leaving I took her picture on my new cell phone &amp;&#160;either she or the passenger&#160;hollered out the window "say cheese".&#160; No, I'll say that you both need help but mostly you need the Lord.&#160; I feel that what I said to her earlier, through the power of the Holy Spirit,&#160;convicted her &amp; this is how she reacted, in a negative way.&#160; I told her like a rapist, the rapist is the one who is doing the evil &amp; should feel badly, not the victim that did nothing wrong.&#160;&#160;They will be in my prayers too.&#160; After&#160;they drove away I realized that Planned Parenthood just put in new cameras all over the place &amp; when people do these kind of things I don't have to take their picture, for the cameras&#160;are doing that for me, if I need to call the police in the future, all the police have to do it to retrieve the film as evidence in the case.&#160;

said in a nice tone of voice " Rachael Phelps, I'm sorry that you can't have children but you don't have to kill other women's children, you could adopt.&#160; Please stop killing these children, please", I was begging her as she drove out onto the street.&#160;

There were a lot of cars in the lot, but as they left over the next two hours, only one driver pulled over to talk to us. The abortionist must have been very busy killing children, because quite a few couples drove out either ignoring us or mocking us. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">One man waiting by the bench outside PP had two young boys with him. I pleaded with him to call his friend on her cell phone and ask her to walk right out of there. He didn’t.

He took a packet for her, and I asked him to tell her about Focus.&#160; We can help her. I think he is feeling more joyful about her decision now.&#160; After all, the baby is his grandchild!

Rob was starting to talk, on the mega phone, to the people coming into the parking lot, of Planned Parenthood,&#160;that were&#160;being greeted by the Death Escort to go in there to have their innocent baby be killed.&#160; It just makes you 'sick to your stomach being out there' but we have to.</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong>My hell was just beginning out there today.&#160; I saw that a young woman was walking past me &amp; I started to engage her in conversation.&#160; I offered her the Truth packet &amp; asked if she was going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that she wasn't going for an abortion but for a Depo Provera shot.&#160; I told her that this shot causes early abortions &amp; can cause her some serious health risks too &amp;&#160;one was osteoporosis, the thinning of the bones, which can cause fractures &amp; can mess up her reproductive organs too.&#160; She told me that she has two children &amp; didn't want anymore.&#160; I asked if she was married &amp; she said "no" so I told her about abstinence.&#160; I said to her to repent &amp; to concentrate on raising her two children.&#160; As I was talking to her I saw that Rob was talking to a young woman on his side of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Then I saw that she was walking over to me.&#160; I just figured that she needed some children's clothes in the center or some more information but I was so wrong.&#160; She stopped to where I &amp; the woman were standing.&#160; I then said to her "can I help you".&#160; She said that the man over there told her to come over to me to talk to me.&#160; I said "are you going into Planned Parenthood"?&#160; She&#160;had no emotion on her face &amp; said that she was going in there right now to have an abortion.&#160; I almost fainted.&#160; I quickly said to her "oh no, please don't have your baby killed for we have a pregnancy center right next to this yellow building &amp; we can help you with free baby clothes &amp; a car seat &amp; a pac'n play&#160;&amp; anything else you need.&#160; She said "I can't afford a baby, I'll have this abortion &amp; in a couple of years from now I'll have a baby."&#160; Oh my God, such an attitude, a kill &amp; retrieve mentally.&#160; She did look at the two graphic pictures that were on the sidewalk &amp; said "is that what abortion looks like".&#160; I said "yes it is".&#160; Then the young woman to which I was talking with before this young girl came over said "I don't believe in abortion &amp; I wouldn't have one but she has a choice &amp; she should do what she thinks is best".&#160; I asked her sternly but politely to leave,&#160;for she wasn't any help to me &amp; she was going to drive this young girl into having an abortion, as I was trying for her not to have one.&#160;She then left us &amp; walked into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Just then a car was driving into the parking lot &amp; I heard Bill say to the people in the car, "choose life your mother did".&#160; The young guy in the car said " shut the ..... up".&#160; I couldn't respond to that guy I was trying to save a life here &amp; now.&#160; Then I saw that the guy got out of his car &amp; walked over to where Rob was standing &amp; I thought that he was going to punch Rob in the face.&#160; After he dropped off his girlfriend to have their baby killed off he went out of Planned Parenthood's parking lot&#160;as fast as he drove in.&#160; This took only a few minutes &amp; I was still talking to this young girl as I was seeing all what was going on around me.&#160; I then took out the Growth &amp; Development pictures out of the Truth packet &amp; showed her the pictures.&#160; She read the part of the baby at 9 weeks, to which she was.&#160;I told her that her baby had a heartbeat &amp; that women do die from abortions to, which is true.&#160; I offered her to come with me to the center to talk to Suzanne, which I was hoping was there now but if she wasn't then I would take her to the Rose Room &amp; let her watch a&#160; DVD until Suzanne arrived to take over the counseling.&#160; She then said to me that she was late for her appointment &amp; that she would talk to them at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told her that they will just tell her to terminate her pregnancy for that's what they do &amp; they're racist too, helping to kill the African American race through birth control &amp; abortion.&#160; She said that she was going in now &amp; I continued to plead with her not to go in there to have her baby killed.&#160; She went in never the less.&#160; Do you know how it feels to know that as she was standing right in front of me on the sidewalk so was her precious baby, knowing that I couldn't do&#160;anything more to save this innocent baby from being killed .&#160; Do you know how helpless &amp; horrible a feeling that is??&#160;&#160;I started to pray &amp; I hoped that she would change her mind but about 3 hours later I saw her in the foyer &amp; flagged her over to come talk to me.&#160; She came around the bushes &amp; as she was nearing me on the sidewalk I said to her "please tell me that you didn't go through with it".&#160; She looked at me &amp; said that she did.&#160; I aid "if you took the pills then you could go to the hospital to have your stomach pumped &amp; if you had put any pills up inside you then the doctors at the hospital can&#160;flush them out", for I though that maybe she had an RU 486 abortion &amp; there was still hope but she looked puzzled at me &amp; said "what pills they went in this way &amp; had&#160;pointed to her private parts".&#160; I was devastated to know that there was no hope &amp; that her innocent, loving baby was dead.&#160; I had also told her earlier that her baby would&#160;give her&#160;unconditional love &amp; she would love her baby &amp; her baby would love her.&#160; She just was selfish enough not to listen &amp; did what she wanted to&#160;&amp; that was to have her baby be&#160;killed by Rachael Phelps here today. She then said to me "every one in there was doing it there were at least ten".&#160; I said "if all of these people were jumping off a bridge would you follow them"?&#160; Rob was now over to where I was standing &amp; he spoke with her as I walked away.&#160; I went into the center, as sick&#160;as a dog, but I went into the Rose Room &amp; got 3 pieces of literature for her, for she was now Post Abortive.&#160;&#160;I walked back to where they both were standing &amp; handed them to her.&#160; I told her that she took a life here today &amp; that she needed to repent, for she has now&#160;put her soul in jeopardy of going to hell.&#160; She will experience many unpleasant emotions, as I told her before she went in for the abortion earlier this afternoon.&#160; She&#160;didn't look like&#160;the same person as she&#160;looked earlier, nor will she ever be that same person again.&#160; I spoke to her for a few more minutes, for I was very upset.&#160; I said "good bye" &amp; walked away &amp; so did she.&#160;She had been on the phone earlier, when I saw her in the foyer,&#160;probably calling for a ride home for she had walked to Planned Parenthood earlier this afternoon&#160;for the abortion. &#160;I helped her out as much a as I could after she had her baby&#160;killed at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was heart sick &amp; was still hoping that she was just fooling me for&#160;I was in denial.&#160;&#160;What do I do which this pain Lord, I have to give it to&#160;you ASAP.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The girl that I was talking to earlier,&#160;that I dismissed to speak to this girl who was going in for an abortion, came out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She stopped &amp; told me that while she was in there she told the girl that was in there for an abortion, saying to her&#160;that she wouldn't have an abortion &amp; even didn't believe in it but it was her chose &amp; her decision that was best for her.&#160; "What"!&#160; I said.&#160; The first part was just fine but did you have to add the second part about that it was her 'chose' &amp; she should do what was best for her??&#160; I said "abortion isn't what's&#160;best for her, now her baby is dead &amp; so is she now emotionally &amp; spiritually".&#160;&#160;&#160;I said "you're being a hypocrite for I told you earlier that you being on the Depo shot that you're also aborting earlier on in your pregnancy, if you conceive, which you could with this birth control as well as any other".&#160; Please ask God to forgive you for having sex outside of marriage &amp; using birth control &amp; maybe aborting your child too, for God is a forgiving &amp; loving God.&#160; Then I said "start over &amp; don't have sex or use any birth control &amp; concentrate on raising the two children that you have &amp;&#160;please read the material in the packet that I gave you earlier".&#160; Then she told me that while&#160;they both were in&#160;the waiting room, in Planned Parenthood,&#160;she said that no matter what we&#160;told to&#160;her outside, on the sidewalk,&#160;she was still going through with the abortion.&#160;

wanted&#160;my help.&#160; I told Sheila, on the phone later that evening, that I never wanted to go back again on the street &amp; she just calmly said "you have to".&#160; Thanks Sheila for the Lord spoke&#160;through you.&#160; Yes, we all need to come back for maybe the next time we're out there on the sidewalk a baby &amp; mother will be saved &amp; that's a 'good thing'.&#160; Mother Mary please give these woman &amp; girls&#160;your Extraordinary Graces not to have their sweet babies be killed by abortion.&#160;

I saw that there were two children, probably around 7 &amp; 10 years old, sitting on the bench in front of the windows of Planned Parenthood along with a man, who I thought maybe was the older brother but found out later that he was their father.&#160; Thanks Dad, for today you brought both my sister &amp; I to this place where mom is having our brother or sister killed......&#160;Ick!!!&#160; The father was enjoying watching the 'Blue Angels' flying in the sky for&#160;he was looking intently on the entertainment while his son or daughter was being killed inside of Planned Parenthood &amp; the two girls were playing&#160;by the fence&#160;on the ground, like it was a park. &#160;How evil!!&#160;&#160;<strong><font size="4">Later on, for&#160;now I&#160;was standing across the street holding a graphic sign, I saw that the husband was helping his wife, who wasn't walking very&#160;well,&#160;to the car &amp; the kids hurried to get in.&#160; As they were leaving the parking lot the mother, with a look of hell on her face, &amp; the father both gave me their middle finger thus showing more abuse to their children who were in the back seat of the car. I do hope that the two girls&#160;didn't give me their middle finger too.

Such child abuse, to say the least, to scar these children for the rest of their lives &amp; this is&#160;also the fastest way to destroy a family, that's for sure.&#160; Lord have Mercy on us all!!!&#160;

After a few minutes I saw that she was walking over to me.&#160; When she approached me I recognized her from the past.&#160; I remember faces more than I remember names.&#160; I asked&#160;her why she was at Planned Parenthood &amp; she said that it was personal then all of a sudden she said that she had been raped in February &amp; lost her job&#160;&amp; has nothing.&#160; I told her that I had been gang raped at Strong Memorial Hospital back in 1971 &amp; lost my twins 6 weeks later by a miscarriage.&#160; I only mentioned this so that she didn't feel alone.&#160;&#160;She said that she was sorry &amp; I told that I was sorry for what had happened to her too.&#160; It's a sisterhood from pain.&#160; &#160;I handed her our list of Rape Counselors for her to call to get the help that she needs.&#160; One counselor who is on the list does it for 'free' if you can't afford to pay her otherwise she runs on a sliding scale payment plan.&#160; Then she said that she wished that she had some money&#160;to go to Wendy's, I said that I could help her with that request.&#160; Then she said that she wished that she had some money for her Bridal dress.&#160; I told her that she could find a nice one at&#160;some of the second hand stores but I couldn't give her any money for that.&#160; She said that she did find one that was $325, which I think was a bit high for a second hand store.&#160; About this time I don't know what to think but I went to my car to get her&#160;some money for&#160;Wendy's.&#160; When I returned she said that she was going to go to Focus to get some food.&#160; Okay I said thinking that she know about us &amp; what we have to offer.&#160; She went to the center &amp; came out about 20 minutes later with some bags &amp; had some of the food from our food shelves too.&#160; (I wish the shelves were better stocked with non perishable foods for the people who need it.&#160; I'm trying to work with the Recourse Center, in East Rochester, for food &amp; diapers etc..&#160; I'll see how they can help us for our center in Rochester, maybe they have rules &amp; can only help those who live in East Rochester, for their needs.&#160; I'll see next week when I go to the Resource Center).&#160; She then&#160;gave me a hug &amp; off she went up the street to Wendys for lunch &amp; hopefully for some more healing after she speaks to the counselor Becky.&#160; She was a&#160;beautiful woman with a tender heart &amp; sweet spirit &amp; had such a soft spoken voice that spoke love &amp; kindness.&#160; I hope &amp; pray the very best for her.&#160; Maybe I'll see her again someday.&#160;

All of a sudden I saw that a woman who was walking very fast &amp; with determination was walking towards me,&#160;I was standing across the street with a graphic sign.&#160; She stopped at the mouth of the driveway &amp; hollered over to me "you ........., I got to do this".&#160; I hollered back over to her saying with a stern voice, "no you don't have to do this".&#160; She then gave me her middle finger &amp; walked briskly to the entrance of Planned Parenthood.&#160;

Martha called back to her saying "as long as you don't kill the pregnancy".&#160; She acted out because she didn't expect us out there showing her what she was about to do to her precious baby.&#160;

They didn't want help they came to Planned Parenthood for an abortion &amp; that was that.&#160; He now joined the other 2 guys were sitting on the bench by the Administrative Entrance, the 'boys club'.&#160;

Their problem was solved, their baby&#160;was now&#160;in a jar in Planned Parenthood's refrigerator.&#160; &#160;That's how they solved their problem, by&#160;killing their little&#160;baby, as if this child was a problem, only in their minds &amp; hearts.&#160; &#160;How evil, how selfish!!!</strong> </span></span></p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><p><strong>Martha, Rob &amp; I ate supper together trying to forget the horrors of this afternoon.&#160; Martha &amp; I went to Holy Hour at St. Jude's&#160;&amp; Rob went home.&#160; </strong></p></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">Monday, July 18, 2011 in&#160;front of Morris Wortman's Killing Mill.&#160;</font></strong></span></div></div></font> </font> </font> </font><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font> </font> </font> </font><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><div>&#160;</div></font> </font> </font> </font> </font> </font><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><div><strong><span style="color: #800000"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">I went to&#160;Morris Wortman's&#160;abortion&#160;facility,&#160;at 2020 Clinton Ave. South,&#160;this evening after Mass at St. John Fisher College.&#160; When I arrived on the sidewalk I saw a man in&#160;Wortman's parking lot &amp;&#160;I spoke to him&#160;saying "he kills children in there".&#160; "What did you say", he said I repeated myself saying "he kills children in there".&#160; Now he was walking up the small hill coming right towards me.&#160; He said "sometimes it's necessary".&#160; I said "it is&#160;never necessary for it's intrinsically evil at all times &amp; if you have had your baby killed then I pray that the Lord will have Mercy on your soul"&#160; I didn't say "repent" for that's all I say in front of Planned Parenthood but I felt that the Holy Spirit was speaking through me &amp; I was at peace to what came out of my mouth.&#160; He came at me &amp; called me very nasty&#160;names &amp; said that he was going to call the police, I guess it was&#160;because I told him the truth &amp; he didn't like that.&#160;"Be not afraid" right!&#160;&#160;I felt that he was a post abortive father &amp; was so angry &amp; filled with rage &amp; took it out on me, which&#160;was okay.&#160; I prayed for him after he drove away.&#160; Then I joined the 'Bound for Life' people.&#160; Brandon, who is the head of the group greeted&#160;me &amp; then asked me what went on over there, I told him what had happened.&#160; He said that he was watching the situation closely &amp; if he had come any closer to me he was coming right over.&#160; I said " that's&#160;good to hear Brandon &amp; thanks do much for looking out for me".&#160; He then&#160;gave me the red tape &amp; wrote on it 'LIFE' &amp; I put it on my mouth &amp; started to say my Rosary &amp; then my Divine Mercy prayers.&#160; The 2 police cars came about&#160;30 minutes later &amp; pulled into Wortman's paking lot later. They didn't even get out of their cars to speak to me&#160;&amp; a few minutes later they left.&#160; Before the police came a young man was walking down the sidewalk &amp; when he got close to Brandon, he took off the red tape from his mouth, &amp; started to talk to the young man.&#160; I was so&#160;very happy that he took the time to speak to him &amp; did so for about 20 minutes.&#160; At the end he even invited him to come to his church this Sunday, I hope&#160;he&#160;will be there.&#160; It was a wonderful witness to this young man that Brandon spent time talking to him about abortion &amp; about the Lord.&#160; As Brandon was talking to him I was praying that 'today would be the first day of the rest of his life'.&#160; Thank you Lord!!</span></span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="color: #800000"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="color: #800000"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">I wish there was help for the post abortive fathers here in Rochester to address their pain &amp;

we always call 911 with any threats that&#160;are made to us.&#160; So just then the girl comes around the bushes again &amp; said "if you're going to call 911 I'll just stay here &amp; wait".&#160; I said "that's fine for you made a threat to this woman &amp; of course we're going to call 911.&#160; I then decided to use my phone to take her picture, for I didn't think that we would be able to get her license number for identification.&#160; She said "you're taking my picture", as she was moving closer to me.&#160; I said "yes I am".&#160; I then the phone to Martha to call 911.&#160; When she got the operator the girl was making so much commotion that Martha had to hang up on the operator, until the girl went back to the Planned Parenthood parking lot.&#160; Then as Martha was calling back the 911 operator we heard the nasty girl on her phone calling 911 too.&#160; Martha got through &amp; completed the call to report a threat to her life &amp; personhood.&#160; A few minutes a police car went right into the Planned Parenthood parking lot &amp; got out of the car.&#160; The reason was that her call got to the police first.&#160; We heard her say, whatever she was saying to the policewoman, for we&#160;still have a right in this country to peacefully protest.&#160;

are biased, comes around the bushes to speak to us.&#160; There was Martha, Jerry &amp; I standing there.&#160; The first thing that she said was "what happened here".&#160; Martha tried to explain&#160;the incident &#160;&amp; then Jerry said something benign &amp; the officer hollered to him to "be quit".&#160; The she spotted me, for I was trying to lay low for I wasn't out here when this incident came down &amp; so I wanted Martha &amp; Jerry to be the ones to explain the situation.&#160; The she said, in a not so nice tone of voice, "just don't say anything to them walking in there just let them go in there".&#160; Well now I needed to say something &amp; if she arrests me for 'whatever' so be it.&#160;&#160;I said "officer we live in America &amp; we have 'freedom of speech' here &amp; by talking to the girls we save their babies lives &amp; their lives too".&#160;

She later called back&#160;&amp; said that the Captain was coming over to Focus to write out a report, which he never did.&#160; Martha got a phone call from officer S. instead &amp; he tried to placate the incident.&#160; Wrong!!&#160; Martha said to him "are you going to do something after I'm on the sidewalk in&#160;a pool of blood".&#160; She rested her case!!!&#160;&#160; Go Martha :)&#160; You tell him.&#160; Another police officer to be reported.&#160;

I &amp; Suzanne, our Thursday counselor, are the God mothers of her.&#160; The other 2 babies were more or less safe from being aborted, thank God.&#160; Pat was with another older woman.&#160; I greeted them both&#160;&amp; Pat, who had our little Akara with her said that this woman knew of someone who was pregnant with triplets was going for an abortion.&#160; What!!!&#160; I said.&#160; Pat said that&#160;they went over to Planned Parenthood to see if she was there but they wouldn't give them any information.&#160; I said that Wortman, in Brighton does 2nd. trimester abortions on Tuesdays but it's now 3pm!!&#160; Then the lady that was with&#160; Pat said "she left early this morning".&#160; I said "what do you think happened to these precious babies by now"?&#160;

get her on the sidewalk, so a passer by policeman did the job for me.&#160; He pulled along side of her &amp; asked her to move onto the sidewalk to which she did promptly.&#160; As he drove pass me I said "I'm sorry officer".&#160; That was that.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>I told Carole that I had to go into the center for a few minutes to talk to Suzanne, our Thursday Client Advocate.&#160; I was gone for about 10 minutes &amp; when I returned Carole told me that the nasty girl was back.&#160; I knew that Martha was making out a report for her arrest, hopefully very soon, &amp; hear she is again.&#160; I was preparing for the worst &amp; that's what I got, on this abortion day.&#160; Carole said that she drove in with her friend, who we found out afterwards that&#160;it was her friend&#160;that was&#160;going for the abortion &amp; not the nasty girl.&#160; It really doesn't matter which one, for a precious baby&#160;was going to die, at the hands of the abortionists, one of many babies that will be slaughtered at this abortion mill today.&#160; How very evil.&#160; When the girl saw Carole she hollered out the window "I see that you're back here today again".&#160;&#160;When I came back outside they were in&#160;Planned Parenthood &amp; I know that Rob was talking to them as they walked into the Killing Mill to try to save this innocent baby from being murdered today.&#160; About 10 minutes later I saw that she was taking Rob's picture where he was standing.&#160; He was a good sport about the intrusion &amp; stood there with both signs in his hands speaking Truth.&#160; I saw that he started to talk to her &amp; then he was walking across the street over to where Carole &amp; I were standing.&#160; Then I saw the nasty girl walk towards us.&#160; As she walked passed me she showed me her child's picture, on her cell phone, &amp; said "I have a daughter so don't speak to me about abortion".&#160; She &amp; Rob were walking to the center.&#160;&#160;Okay, that'll work.&#160; About 10 minutes later they both come back&#160;out onto the sidewalk again &amp; she had two books with her.&#160; As she passed by me she said "I took these two books because they're expensive &amp; I didn't give my real name or address on you Sign In Sheet &amp; I lambasted everyone who was in there too.&#160; I later found out that she said to Rob,&#160;"you know that blonde, she's a&#160;"witch" &amp; Rob&#160;replied "no, she's the director of the pregnancy center".&#160; OOP's!!&#160; What a character difference.&#160; &#160;She was itching for trouble or whatever.&#160; So she decided to sit down on the wooden bench that surrounds the tall bushes used to block our vision of the people going into Planned Parenthood, which it really doesn't, we can see everything, for we have the eyes of Christ.&#160; Well she started talking &amp; I started to talk back too.&#160; I must have hit a nerve for she told me not to talk to her again, so I tried not too but&#160;she was so bothersome that I just had it &amp; I told her that she was going to be arrested &amp; was going down.&#160; I lost it.&#160; Carole &amp; I did have enough of her remarks &amp; bothersome attitude so I flagged a police car that was coming down the road &amp; the car stopped right in front of me.&#160; I looked into the car &amp; said&#160;"hi Officer Chris".&#160; Oh my goodness the Lord sent me Officer Chris to&#160;our rescue.&#160; He got out of the car &amp; I briefly told him what was going on &amp; then he spoke with her.&#160; She said to Officer Chris, that I said, that&#160;she was going to be arrested &amp;&#160;she was going down.&#160;&#160;Well that's the truth.&#160; Some part of me wanted to warn her what&#160;was&#160;going to happen to her, in the near future, &amp; part of me was being nasty too.&#160;&#160;Not to happy with myself &amp; that happens&#160;on a regular bases.&#160; Officer Chris came back to talk to&#160;me &amp; said that the Sergeant was trying to contact Martha yesterday to make out a police report but they couldn't reach her.&#160; I said that she gave her home phone number, for she doesn't use her cell phone, so I don't know what happened there.&#160; Just then the girl came around the bushes &amp; asked to speak to Officer Chris again.&#160; He walked over to her &amp; they both went into the Planned Parenthood parking lot, to talk.&#160; They spoke for at least 10 minutes or that's how it felt &amp; when Officer Chris returned to where I was standing he said " the warrant usually takes 72 hours before the arrest".&#160; I later found out that she&#160;said to him that she had to go because her friend was in there (Planned Parenthood) having an abortion.&#160; She told the wrong police officer that, for he's 100% Catholic &amp; 100% pro life.&#160;&#160;That statement&#160;must have made his stomach turn.&#160; He's not biased, he's just&#160;right.&#160; He also mentioned the reporting of the woman police officer.&#160; I said that Martha was doing that &amp; that if he had answered the call, on Tuesday,&#160;none of this would have happened, for he's fair to both parties, when he answers a call.&#160; He said that he was with his children &amp; he can't be in two places at once.&#160; I said "that's true".&#160;&#160;He got back into his car &amp; I said that we&#160;are praying for him &amp; his safety &amp; I started the St. Michael's Prayer, as he drove away.&#160; He smiled.&#160; Thank you Lord for sending me Officer Chris.&#160; We have a 'special' bond for it was a couple of years ago that a friend of mine said that I should have reported the&#160;gang rape back in 1971, for I could have saved other women, of the same fate.&#160; He made me feel so badly about that, even though I really didn't know, at the time of the attack what really happened to me, until 6 weeks later when the miscarriage occurred&#160;&amp; it still didn't register in my mind, for my mother told me to "flush it" down the toilet.&#160; I also flushed it from my mind that day too.&#160; Well one day after I came out of Mass at Our Lady of Victory I saw a policeman &amp; I went up to him&#160;&amp; said "I would like to make out a report of a gang rape back in 1971 at Strong Memorial Hospital".&#160; He looked at me tenderly &amp; said "I'm sorry&#160;that&#160;happened to&#160;you but that&#160;the stature of limitations was up".&#160; I said "I thought so but I just wanted to report it to a police officer because I never had the chance to&#160;after&#160;the rape&#160;happened ".&#160; I then told him I got pregnant from the rape &amp;&#160;miscarried twins 6 weeks later".&#160; He was sensitive &amp; caring, there was nothing he&#160;could really do legally, but he did a lot just by his reaction to what I had now&#160;told him.&#160; So we have a 'special' bond.&#160; I can tell you though, if he every would stop me for a traffic violation I'd get a ticket from him in a flash, for he goes by the book.&#160; So I hope that I&#160;never get sopped by Officer Chris.&#160; He's 'special'.&#160; Thank you Lord &amp; please always protect&#160;Officer Chris&#160;&amp; all the Offices that protect us every day, from danger.</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>One car after another came out of Planned Parenthood, with the post abortive mothers, giving me&#160;their middle finger.&#160;

How bizarre!&#160; Call the police!!&#160; What!!&#160; He said that it was against the law for us to feed Cleveland &amp; if we want to feed him then feed him, in the center, not on the sidewalk.&#160; Cleveland might be arrested for pan handling but I'd make sure that I was the one to go to jail &amp; not him.&#160; We, as Christians, are called to feed the hungry &amp; love one another &amp; by the grace of God go I. &#160;We give him Ramon noodles, in a cup, in front of Buckpitt, the business right next door to Planned Parenthood &amp;

"What", I said &amp; walked very fast to where she was in the office.&#160; What happened was that she was going into her purse that she hides under the desk, to get some money out to go next door to buy Cleveland a bottle of pop when all of a sudden she was stung by a bee, which she is deathly allergic to.&#160; Oh no!!&#160; She must have brought the bee in with her from the outside for I didn't see a bee in the center while I was in there working.&#160; If so I would have taken care of it.&#160; So I hurried to get my head&#160;on straight &amp; get my car keys &amp; ask Ryan &amp; Ryan to lock up for me.&#160; The father said that they would stay until we get back from the hospital.&#160; I said "that's so nice of&#160;you &amp; thank you so much".&#160; Martha &amp; I were gone.&#160; I drove her to the General Hospital as fast as I could but being careful &amp; praying all the way there.&#160; I was hoping that I would see a police car &amp; stop &amp; ask him or her if they would take Martha to the hospital a little faster than I.&#160; She didn't want to use her Epee pen, which is&#160;a huge needle, that you jab into your thigh, so you won't go into shock.&#160; She just told me to take her to the hospital &amp; they would&#160;take it from there.&#160; Okay Martha, anything you say, you're the boss now.&#160; We got to the Emergency Room &amp; I let her out of the car &amp; went to go to park in the parking lot nearby.&#160; I had to make a fast phone call first to Kristen, the director of Place of Hope Pregnancy Center,&#160;to tell her that we won't be at the 'Condoms in the School' meeting tonight.&#160; I left a message on her cell phone.&#160; I then walked into the Emergency Room waiting&#160;area &amp; sat down next to Martha who had already signed in.&#160; I received some calls from Ryan saying that some moms were there picking up some lager items for their children so I told him to make sure that they sign the Liability Sheet before they left the center.&#160; We made contact more than a couple of times during the evening.&#160; After the last phone call with Ryan I heard him say to his son "what is on your leg, it's all red &amp; swollen"?&#160; He said that he was going to lock up the center &amp; take his son to the Strong Memorial Hospital Emergency Room to check it out.&#160; Oh no not again.&#160; What are the chances that all us were ending in the ER this evening.&#160; I said thank you to him &amp; please let me know how Ryan makes out with his medical crisis too.&#160; Then the doctor comes into Martha's room.&#160; We thought that he was going to send her home but he added more hours to the treatment plus an IV line &amp; some medication to boot.&#160; It would be now 11:30pm that she could possibly go home tonight.&#160; I said that I would go upstairs to go see my ex boss, who had been in the hospital, for the last 6 weeks.&#160; Most of that time he was in ICU which means family only.&#160; After that I told Martha that I would go back to the center &amp; do some work there &amp; when&#160;she was&#160;ready to go home I'd come back to pick her&#160;up &amp; bring&#160;her back to the center to pick up&#160;her car.&#160; Does this sound&#160;like a plan or what!!!&#160; I said so long to Martha &amp; off I went to find my ex boss's room on the 5th. floor.&#160; His wife is a friend of mine &amp; I've been keeping a progress report through her almost daily.&#160; I arrived to his room only to see that he was so emaciated looking it really bothered me at fist glance.&#160; We talked for a little while &amp; I ordinated him a bit for he thought that it was 8am &amp; not 8pm.&#160; Hospital life is so confusing &amp; depressing, to say the least.&#160; I even was an ex nurse &amp; I hate hospitals now.&#160; Go figure.&#160; Maybe because I was gang raped in one &amp; my back was twisted in another by a so called doctor &amp; now have permanent L-5 back injury &amp; was molested by the doctor who took out my appendix.&#160; I later reported him to the AMA.&#160; I wish that he was arrested by my word against his work kind of thing.&#160; He was reprimanded by the AMA though, which I guess was some justice.&#160; Well I degrees of my dislike of hospitals for people die, in them,&#160;but some people get better in them too.&#160; After my visit with my ex boss, his company&#160;closed on 2009,&#160; decided to go back down in the Emergency Room to be with Martha to keep her company instead of going back to the center, so I surprised her when I came into the room about 40 minutes later.&#160; We spent some quality time together, eating Jell-O &amp; watching the Food Channel together.&#160; Misery loves company.&#160; It was now around 10:15pm when the doctor came back in the room.&#160; He talked with Martha &amp; I &amp; then decided to admit her to the hospital, just in case she might have a later reaction while at home all by herself.&#160; Okay Doc whatever you say.&#160; I then said to Martha that I was going to go back to the center to check the rooms &amp; then go home to eat.&#160; The plan was that she was going to call a taxi in the morning after she was discharged to take her to go get her car at the parking lot at the center.&#160; This sounds like it would work.&#160; I said good bye Martha &amp; please call me when you get home tomorrow to which she said that she would.&#160; I then went back to the center &amp; turned off the radio &amp; computer &amp; went home &amp; ate late &amp; had a big glass of red wine to boot then went to bed around 3am, which is much to late.&#160; I've got to be better about going to bed so late!!!&#160; Sleep tight dear Martha &amp; don't let the bed bugs bite.&#160;

She was one of our regular clients &amp; wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I asked how she got in for I hadn't heard the doorbell ring &amp; she said that the door was open.&#160; "Okay", I said.&#160; I got up to take her the Rose Room for the pregnancy test.&#160;

C. to pick up the DVD's &amp; CD's that he burns for us at Focus to hand out to our clients &amp; the people on the sidewalk.&#160; My cell phone rang &amp; I pulled over to the side of the expressway to answer it, with my emergency lights on.&#160; It was&#160;a girl who wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I said that I could be there at 3:30pm, for I wanted to go to Mass at St. John Fisher at 4:30pm&#160;&amp; then go to T-Mobile to get minutes put&#160;on the cell phone &amp; then to go to the Dollar General for supplies for Focus.&#160; I had it all planned out but&#160;the joke was on me, later on.&#160; I&#160;picked up the CD's &amp; DVD's at the Rectory &amp; thanked Father &amp; he gave me his blessing &amp; off I went to the center.&#160; When I arrived there I asked the&#160;taxi guys to help me empty out my car of&#160;the donations I received from Ana, at the Second Hand Store.&#160; She stops by my apartment&#160;&amp; puts the donations in&#160;my garage &amp; I then put them&#160;in my car &amp; then take them to the center.&#160; How nice&#160;is that!!&#160; &#160;After the guys helped me put the donations in the Great Room I started to do other things &amp; to get the Rose Room ready for the pregnancy test.&#160; As I opened up the office there was a envelope on&#160;my desk &amp; we received a nice check, for the baby pins that I just purchased for the center, from the Fingerlakes Right to Life, how great was that.&#160; Thanks Colleen &amp; all at the FRTL.&#160; God bless you.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; I went to answer it &amp; there was a woman &amp; three children with her, one was a toddler in the stroller.&#160; I asked if she had called me for a pregnancy test &amp; she said "no, but I'd like one".&#160; "Okay" I said &amp; lead her into the Green Room to fill out the Intake Sheet first.&#160; I was sad to see that she was post abortive &amp; I later talked to her about that.&#160; She said that she has asked the Lord to forgive her &amp; it was done this year at Strong Memorial Hospital by Nancy Stanwood , who does abortions in the 2nd. trimester.&#160; She said that if her mother ever finds out that she'd kill her.&#160; I gave her many brochures on Post Abortion &amp; then gave her the pregnancy test which was negative.&#160; I also spoke to her about abstinence.&#160; Her children were having fun in the Material Aid Room &amp; they picked out some toys &amp; books.&#160; I told her to come back another time to get some clothes for the children.&#160; She needed diapers today so I went into the Great Room to get them &amp; baby wipes for her.&#160; Just before they left my appointment for 3:30pm had arrived.&#160; I settled her into the Rose Room to fill out the Intake Sheet &amp; then went to say good bye to the mom &amp; her children.&#160; I went back to the Rose Room to concentrate on her.&#160; I saw that she was only 15 years old so I gathered up some brochures that would hopefully help her to abstain &amp; also&#160;a DVD &amp; CD too.&#160; Her pregnancy test was negative, thank God &amp; she was happy about that too.&#160; She could have been abortion minded or her family could have been.&#160; After she left I was cleaning up &amp; was ready to head over to the College for Mass.&#160; I locked all the doors &amp; then as I was leaving a mom with her baby, in the stroller, was walking towards the door.&#160; She said that she was here to pick up a bag that was left for her, for she received a call from Suzanne, last Thursday.&#160; I said that I would go get it for her &amp; then race to get to Mass on time.&#160; I reached for my keys to find that I didn't have them on me &amp; all the doors to the center were locked.&#160; I knew that God had another plan for it wasn't for me to get to Mass at 4:30 for it was now 4:20pm &amp; it takes about 15 or more minutes to get there from here.&#160; I brought her into the&#160;hallway &amp; then&#160;brought her to the All Purpose Room, which I call the Green Room, to wait for Martha to come for I just called her.&#160; Thank God that I had my cell phone in my pocket&#160;&amp; she was home otherwise I would have&#160;had to sleep on the carpet floor.&#160; I did other things while waiting for Martha plus I was taking to&#160;our newest mom, for this was baby # 12, little&#160;Joyce, who was here with her mother, waiting here for her carry all bag.&#160; Martha finally arrived &amp; she let me into all the rooms &amp; I found my keys in the basket, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I must have put them down while trying to pick up after the children that were there earlier.&#160; Dumb, Dumb!!!&#160;&#160; We ordered a taxi to take our newest mom home for her load was very heavy &amp; then I treated Martha for supper&#160;at the South Wedge Restaurant, which is my favorite diner.&#160; After that I went to T-Mobile, for phone minutes&#160;&amp; then to the Hardware&#160;Store to get Martha's wasp &amp; bee trap &amp; to make extra keys, so that I can hide them in the Green Room, so if this ever happens again I can retrieve them quickly to get my keys from the locked door.&#160; Then I went to the&#160;Dollar General to get supplies for the center &amp; went home.&#160; God&#160;is with me always!&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">You too!</span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span><div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">Tuesday, August 9, 2011 in Focus</font></strong></span></span></div><div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>It was rainy but that's not why were weren't out on the front lines today, it was because we had so much to do in the center to put away the many donations that we have been blessed with.&#160;

When I arrived there was a regular client in the Material Aid Room with the son who she took on to take care of, he's not her biological son but he was dropped off at her doorsteps &amp; she's been taking good care of him ever since.&#160; I admire her so much &amp; I think the young boy is so happy to come to Focus to get some nice&#160;things on a regular bases.&#160; Nice boy!&#160; I gathered up the mega phone &amp; the literature box to go to the front lines.&#160; Before I went out I did some fast office work first.&#160; I went out to the front lines &amp; said 'hi' to everyone.&#160; I noticed that the Planned Parenthood&#160;parking lot was empty &amp; I thought, for a brief moment, that&#160;it was closed but reality set in when I spoke with Sheila for a fast review of what when on during her time.&#160; She threw the cold water on me right away &amp; got me back into reality &amp; out of dream land.&#160; Sheila said that an abortion had already taken place &amp; there was an abortionist there today.&#160; She spoke with the sister of a young woman who has 5 children that decided to kill baby # 6 this morning.&#160; Her sister tired to save this precious baby's life but her sister 'choose death' for this child &amp; deprived the other siblings of a brother or sister&#160;&amp; took a life that ONLY God has the right to do.&#160; It was a sad beginning.&#160; After Sheila &amp; Dennis &amp; Addison &amp; Dan had left it was Bill, across the street, Martha, Carole &amp; I for the rest of the afternoon.&#160; Paul came back after lunch to work in the center helping out in the Material Aid Room &amp; then&#160;making up Truth packets, for us to hand out.&#160; I was there when we were blessed with a donation from two moms of many nice things &amp; then they went shopping in the Material Aid Room for their children.&#160; I made a quick phone call to Pat, out grandmother &amp; great grandmother &amp; told her that I just received a check for her for her family &amp; to come &amp; to receive it &amp; also to get some other things too.&#160; She arrived about 45 minutes later &amp; It was so good to see her again, for&#160;I miss her, for she is an inspiration &amp; a wonderful person that&#160;has raised her 4 grandchildren &amp;&#160;saved&#160;her 4 great grandchildren, from abortion.&#160; I wish I or someone else&#160;could write a book about her life....&#160;it would change lives.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>I said good bye to Pat &amp;

About 15 minutes later Cleveland, our street friend, was coming down the street to receive some food that we had for him.&#160; Then all of a sudden there was the man, who I thought was a nice guy, for&#160;we've done some&#160;business with him in the past at Focus, for he has a printing business about 3 doors down from Planned Parenthood, on the brick side of the building,&#160;was walking towards Martha &amp; I .&#160; He chased Cleveland into the street &amp; I told Cleveland to come on&#160;back to the sidewalk so that he wouldn't get run over by a car.&#160; I was so upset &amp; so was Martha.&#160;&#160;A car had just come into the parking lot so I had to&#160;address them first, to offer them help, before confronting Mr. V.&#160;to give him a piece if my mind.&#160; The nerve of him approaching Martha &amp; I &amp; starting an altercation&#160;on the sidewalk with us because&#160;we're feeding Cleveland, our street friend.&#160; The nerve!!!&#160; &#160;He was talking to Martha before I came back from being by the fence.&#160; He said that he had talked to a police officer &amp; he said that we could be arrested for aiding &amp; abetting a street person.&#160; What!!!&#160; I never heard such a thing.&#160; He looked at Martha who was standing right in front of him &amp; said "I can picture you in jail".&#160; What a nasty thing to say to this wonderful woman.&#160; Martha then asked if could see Jesus in Cleveland &amp; if he had any children &amp; that she was going to pray to an Italian Saint like St. Padre Pio &amp; St. Anthony.&#160; He said to her that he does printing for Planned Parenthood &amp; he just lets us stay here, on the street.&#160; What!!!&#160; He has no power over us &amp; our Constitutional rights to protest &amp; our Freedom of Speech, in front of an abortion mill.&#160; He's changed, he's not the same man that I did business with awhile ago at Focus.&#160; I think it's because he's compromised &amp; is now doing work for Planned Parenthood &amp; receiving 'Blood Money".&#160; I told him to take responsibility for his business doing badly &amp; stop blaming Cleveland for your miss management.&#160; Off he goes back to the Clinton Printing Company &amp; we hope that he repents!!&#160; After he left&#160; I suggested to Martha that we call 311 &amp; talk to some one in the City.&#160; She called &amp; explained the threat to her on the phone of us being arrested if we give food to the poor.&#160; She answered "no" then she put someone else on the phone &amp; he said that there wasn't anything in the books that indicate that could happen.&#160; Thanks 311 &amp; then we called our attorney Mary A. &amp; left a message on her phone &amp; also to inform her that Martha has an order of protection now from the girl that threatened her person hood with the mega phone &amp; she has an appointment with the arbitrator &amp; the woman police officer, next Thursday at 1pm,&#160;that answered the call that day of the threat.&#160; I'm sure that our attorney will get back to us regarding this 'new' event on the front lines.&#160;

After he left our new young lady came to introduce herself to us again for it was about 2 months ago she came in for some children clothes &amp; asked if she could volunteer at Focus.&#160; She's on DSS &amp; has to do 20-30 hours weekly.&#160; Later on I received a call from her case worker &amp; had to fill out a form &amp; she was suppose to start the next week but she never showed up.&#160; On Tuesday this week I received a call from her asking if she could work at Focus for she dislikes where she was sent.&#160; I said 'okay' &amp; had to fax a letter on the Focus letterhead to her case worker.&#160; Now she was here to help us out in the Material Aid Room especially.&#160; Yeah.&#160; As she was there at the center a young mother came in for children clothes &amp; she helped her out in the clothing room.&#160; I had to take a 10 minutes nap for&#160;I was drained &amp; Martha was in the Material Aid Room to help the girls out.&#160; After I got up from the sofa in the Great Room I decided to go over to Mr. V.'s business, down the street,&#160;to get his address so as to give it to our attorney if she wants to sent him a letter.&#160; So I went into the office to get a pen &amp; paper &amp; told Martha that I would be back very soon.&#160; Now&#160;Martha &amp; Alexis were making supper.&#160; As I was walking up the street I saw a police car with his lights on.&#160; It looked like a minor accident so I decided to go to se if I could talk to him.&#160; I discerned that no one was injured or worst so I just leaned against the building &amp; waited&#160;for him to finish his paper work.&#160; He looked over to me &amp; said "can I help you".&#160; I said "I know that you're busy officer but I have a quick question".&#160; We protest Planned Parenthood &amp; someone told us that we could get arrested for giving food to a street person.&#160;&#160;"Who said that"? he asked .&#160; I said "the guy up the street that owns the printing company".&#160; I then said all we give Cleveland is Ramon noodles 7 sardines &amp; how would he like that for his supper tonight"?&#160; The officer said that you couldn't get arrested for giving food to anyone unless you're blocking the street or sidewalk or causing a commotion".&#160; I said that just doesn't happen.&#160; "You're all right then".&#160; I said "thank you officer &amp; have a nice evening &amp; walked back to the center.&#160; When I was walking passed Planned Parenthood &amp; went over to the fence &amp; looked in the parking lot &amp; I saw a young girl in the foyer.&#160; I called over to her &amp; it looked like she was crying.&#160; I told her if she had an abortion to ask God to forgive her &amp; to get counseling from Project Rachel.&#160; She just looked at me &amp; then looked down.&#160; I made the sign of the cross &amp; then went back to the center where&#160; Martha &amp; Alexis were eating.&#160; I guess I was gone longer than I thought.&#160; We had a nice supper &amp; conversation &amp; our new helper I feel will work out great.&#160; After supper Martha said that she was going to take Alexis home &amp; then from there she was going to the Holy Hour of Fatima, at St. Jude's.&#160; I said that I would do up the dishes &amp; clean up &amp; then I'll meet you at church.&#160;I said "good bye" to Alexis &amp; gave her the schedule of the days &amp; hours at Focus.&#160;She will start on Monday.&#160; Thank you Lord for answering this prayer for more help at Focus.&#160; I started to clean up &amp; then I heard the phone ring in the office &amp; I went to answer it.&#160; It was our mom who's pregnant with twins &amp; she said that she'll be there in a few minutes to pick up the car seat.&#160; "Okay", I said &amp; then hurried even faster in the clean up of the dishes so that I could be ready when she comes, so that I could get to church on time.&#160; She came about 15 minutes later just enough time to do the dishes for we had a very big meal tonight.&#160; When she arrived she was happy to pick out a car seat for her boy twin for she had the car seat for her girl twin.&#160; She had to go to court today in regards to the father of the twins &amp; she said that it didn't go well.&#160; I didn't want to press her into anything more than that.&#160; She went into the Material Aid Room &amp; picked up some nice things for her twins that will be born in October.&#160; She said that she was ready to push.&#160; I said "no, not tonight, you have to wait a little longer"..... She had to many things to carry so I got her a cab from the office next to mine.&#160; She was happy that she didn't have to take a bus tonight.&#160; I said "good bye &amp; please try to stop back in before October".&#160; Off she went home &amp; off I went to church.</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></div><hr /><p><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong><span style="font-size: medium">Tuesday, August 16, 2011&#160;at Focus</span></strong></span></span></p><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="font-size: medium">I received the bad news that on Sunday there was a terrible storm in Rochester &amp; our pregnancy center was hit hard for it had flooded.&#160; I was told that the water went up to the door way &amp; had seeped into all the rooms of the pregnancy center &amp; the taxi room &amp; the accountant's office &amp; even the Realtor for the first time ever.&#160; When I arrived there on Tuesday it was a mess to say the least &amp; it stunk like no body's business.&#160; We had our work cut out for us.&#160; It was so bad that Martha &amp; Carole had to go outside to pray &amp; witness &amp; I Paul stayed in to do the clean up.&#160;Alexis couldn't make it today due to her daughter being sick.&#160; The landlord was there &amp; had been for two days using the wet vac on the carpets &amp; in some of the rooms it didn't really make a difference for the carpet was so thick that he couldn't suck up all the water that was underneath it.&#160; He had to go buy a dehumidifier, costing $300&#160;&amp; had to fix the other one, that was broken,&#160;so that we had&#160;2 dehumidifiers,&#160;to do the work.&#160; The accountant took his computer home to do his work there &amp; lit a candle to help with the smell, which lasted&#160;for the entire week.&#160; When the people came into the center, to go into the Material Aid Room &amp; for pregnancy tests,&#160;I tried to warn them first, but it they just came into the center&#160;through the front door, for we had all the doors opened, even though the air conditioner was on, they said "wow what smells"?&#160; I then explained that we were working on the water&#160;problem &amp; it was only temporary so come on in&#160;&amp; get what&#160;you need for your children &amp; for yourselves.&#160; They were very nice about the icky atmosphere &amp; were supportive of us.&#160; &#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="font-size: medium">After awhile Carol &amp; Martha came back in &amp; helped with the mess.&#160; Then all of a sudden Martha says to me "lets call Christian Carpeting &amp; get an estimate for new indoor&#160;/ outdoor carpets for the Material Aid Room the Rose/Pregnancy Testing/ Literature Room &amp; for the Office".&#160; I said "okay Martha lets do it", so I called &amp; made an appointment for the next day at 3pm.&#160; We will trust in the Lord to how to pay for it because the&#160;carpets, in the 3 rooms, are not mold &amp; mildew&#160;resistant like the&#160;carpets in the Great Room, Green All Purpose Room &amp; the Hallway are.&#160;There was a big chance that the&#160;carpets that had gotten wet in the 3 rooms would be growing mold &amp; mildew real soon &amp; that would not be healthy for us&#160;or for&#160;our clients &amp; their children &amp; it would smell in the center, &amp; we wouldn't want that.&#160; So this was the answer to our problem, new carpeting.&#160; The landlord was there still wet vacing the carpets in the other offices down the hall.&#160; He said that he would prevent this from ever happening again for he will put a hole in the wall of the men's bathroom &amp; put a huge pipe through it so that the accumulation of water on the roof from a heavy rain will travel through the pipe to the outside rather than regurgitate through the men's &amp; women's toilets &amp; go onto the carpets in the center &amp; elsewhere.&#160; He was planning to do the work on Wednesday, which he really should have done about 3 years ago.&#160; Talk about putting a project on hold.&#160; This time not just us but everyone was upset with him &amp; now he had to do something about the problem plus he was tired of spending time using the wet vac in so many rooms.&#160; He said that he got home late two days in a row, please give me a break.&#160; We are trying to get along with our landlord &amp; so far we have a nice relationship with him&#160;&amp; we don't want to go back to what&#160;it was like,&#160;at one time in the past,&#160;so I gave him no trouble in this shocking event.&#160;

This was a real hardship for us at Focus.&#160; I asked the Lord to turn this mess into something good, so I figured it was the new carpeting that we will be getting, it will also make the center look even better!!!&#160;

at Focus</strong></span></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Martha had to go to court today &amp; I went with her for support.&#160; We met at Focus &amp; rode together to the court house.&#160;This is the case of the young girl that threatened Martha's life, a couple of weeks ago on the front lines,&#160;&amp; we called the police &amp; then the attorney that day.&#160; So today is the day of justice.&#160; We arrived early &amp; sat down in the huge lobby where two girls were also sitting.&#160; I mentioned that we had a Pregnancy Center, two door down from Planned Parenthood, where they kill little babies.&#160; They both were surprised for they didn't know that &amp; they seemed upset with the new information that was just given them.&#160; The one girl said that she has 5 children &amp; so I handed her our brochure &amp; also gave the other girl one too.&#160; I said that we give out free baby &amp; children clothes &amp; small items &amp; what days &amp; hours that we're open.&#160; They thanked us &amp; I asked if anyone knew where the bathrooms were.&#160; The one girl with the 5 children said that she knows where it was &amp; I followed her.&#160; When we got to the bathroom she told me that she almost had an abortion at Wortman's on Clinton Ave. but changed her mind.&#160; I said "thank God" &amp; then asked her what made her change her mind &amp; she said "God".&#160; I said "God is good, God is great".&#160; She said that Wortman was a creepy man &amp; I said that I agreed with her for he has murdered over 26 thousand children since 1986 when I first protested his abortion mill in Brighton.&#160; I also said that he permanently injured my back by twisting me in the hallway of Highland Hospital where we both worked in 1978.&#160; He is a monster &amp;&#160;she agreed.&#160; We both walked to back to the Lobby.&#160;&#160; Martha &amp; I said that we hoped to see you both at the center sometime picking out clothes for your children.&#160; I don't know why they were at the court house &amp; they didn't ask us why we were there either.&#160; We then went around the corner to a little coffee shop where Martha wanted a quick cup.&#160; I got started talking to the woman who has run this very small coffee &amp; beverage shop for the last 6 years.&#160; She said that she has many health issues but that God has blessed her with this job.&#160; I handed her our business card &amp; told her briefly about Focus.&#160; She asked if we take clothes as a donation.&#160; I answered back that we do &amp; if you would like to donate please feel free to call me.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; We said "good bye" &amp; off we went to the court room &amp; sat down.&#160; We were there a little early so we were able to hear many cases before Martha' attorney arrived &amp; spoke with her for a few minutes.&#160; Miss F., the young girl who had threatened Martha,&#160;had already arrived &amp; was sitting on the other side of the room.&#160; Then her name was called &amp; there she was standing by the attorney that was hearing all the cases this morning.&#160; The DA was right next to her.&#160; Judge Y. spoke first then Miss F. said to the Judge that she knew that she had an Order of Protection but she needed&#160;still to go to Planned Parenthood for her health care.&#160; This is when I made my first face that I made by rolling my eyes.&#160; The Judge stated that she didn't have to seek out another health care facility &amp; she could still go to Planned Parenthood but she had to keep away from Martha Malone, when she was there.&#160;I think that this was my second face that I made?&#160; Then the Judge gave her 16 hours of Community Service &amp; it seemed to be agreed to by Miss F. but when then she said that she didn't agree &amp; wanted a bench trail.&#160; I know that this my another face that I made.&#160; I didn't want to stay in court forever &amp; how dare she not take this deal which she deserves.&#160; Her &amp; her attorney walked out of the court room to discuss this matter.&#160; Then all of a sudden the woman Deputy is standing in the middle of the aisle between the two places of seating &amp; stands there &amp; is saying something looking over to me.&#160; I couldn't heart her &amp; I thought&#160; that she was talking to someone behind me but when I turned around I saw that there wasn't anyone behind me.&#160; I then guessed she was speaking to me but I still couldn't hear what she was saying to me for I wasn't talking, eating or drinking or using my cell phone like the sign on the wall stated.&#160; She walked away &amp; Martha attorney &amp; has been mime in the past for she defended me in Federal Court back in 1999, turned around, for she was sitting in front of Martha Who I was sitting next to &amp; said "Mary behave yourself".&#160; I was still puzzled for I had done but the only thing I came up with was that I was expressing myself with my face.&#160; I didn't know that you couldn't do that for it was written on the sin that was posted on the wall.&#160; I guess you have to sit there &amp; have NO emotion on your face otherwise you will be scolded by the Deputy.&#160; A lesson learned today.&#160; The girl &amp; her attorney came back into the court room after being gone for about 10 long minutes &amp; she took the deal for 16 hours of Community Service.&#160; The Judge said for her to call the number &amp; have it completed in 3 weeks.&#160; Then Miss F. said to the Judge that she was a mother &amp; a student at FingerLakes Community College &amp; had a job.&#160; Isn't it funny that she got away form all her responsibilities on&#160; a Tuesday &amp; a Thursday a couple of weeks ago to drive her friend into Planned Parenthood to help her get an abortion &amp; to threatened Martha &amp; to bug &amp; disrespect me &amp; she can't find any time know to do her Community Service???&#160; The Judge told her that she will have 3 months to complete it.&#160; I hope that I didn't make another face at that time &amp; if I accidentally did that the Deputy didn't see me otherwise I might have been arrested for Contempt of Court or something.&#160; I don't know why I get myself is so much unnecessary trouble.&#160; I told Martha that I look young &amp; act immaturely at times.&#160; I'll never grow up.&#160; After Miss F. left the court room Martha &amp; the attorney left the court room.&#160; When I got up from my seat I walked over to the Deputy &amp; touched her gently on her right shoulder, which I never do to strangers especially those who are in authority &amp; said "I'm sorry if you thought that I was disrespecting the court it's just that it's emotional".&#160; She replied stiffly "Yes this is a highly emotional place".&#160; I then said "good bye" &amp; left to join my two friends, who one was a bit nervous meaning Mary the attorney.&#160; She said to me "where were you"?&#160; I said that I was just talking to the Deputy for a minute.&#160; She seemed more relaxed&#160; then.&#160; She said that she was very happy that the court took her suggestion of the 16 hours of Community Service, for she thought that her attorney would try to get it down to 8 hours which she didn't so Mary the attorney felt it was a victory for her, which it was but by the grace of God.&#160; Thank you Lord!!&#160;&#160; Martha &amp; I said "good bye" to Mary who was know speaking to the girls attorney &amp; off Martha * I went to the ramp garage to find the car &amp; go to Mass at 12:10, so we thought.&#160; It took us 20&#160; minutes &amp; some tears &amp; prayers to finally find the car &amp; we got to Mass after the homily.&#160; After Mass we headed back to Focus to do some more dirty work there.&#160;

I did a pregnancy test (really it was 2 tests to make sure) on a girl who's grandmother brought her in &amp; it was positive.&#160; The grandmother will support her &amp; her baby &amp; if&#160;her mother has problems with that then her mother (the grandmother) will have a talk with her that's for sure.&#160; It was good to see this support &amp; even though she was only 14 that she would not have her baby be killed by abortion.&#160; If you are old enough to have sex &amp; get pregnant than you are old enough to have a baby &amp;

with the carpet , labor &amp; the baseboards for the 2 rooms it will cost $1,201.00 without tax for we are tax exempt.&#160; I went out side to ask Bernie if he would pay for the carpet &amp; he said "no, it's not necessary for these carpets will dry out in time".&#160; I said that they will be breeding mold &amp; mildew for the carpets didn't dry completely.&#160; I was disappointed &amp; started to walk away when he said that he would pay for half.&#160; I said "okay &amp; thanks".&#160; I went back into the center &amp; said we will have new carpeting put in the 3 rooms, to Jason.&#160; He said "fine &amp; we'll schedule for next Tuesday at 9am.&#160; I looked over at Martha for she is a morning person &amp; I'm a night person &amp; that souned to early for me but I want the center to get in shape &amp; back to normal after this horrible water damage, as soon as possible.&#160; I asked her &amp; she said that she'll be there at 9am &amp; I told her that I'll be there around 10am.&#160; There's really nothing we can start to do, until after they finish each room, so that would be later in the morning.&#160; Jason said that it probably will be a 5 hour job.&#160; Thank God we'll have to help us on Tuesday: Martha, Carole, Paul, Alexis &amp; myself to put the rooms back together.&#160; We also will have the '40 Days for Life' meeting at 7pm &amp; we'll have to make some room somewhere to have the meeting.&#160;

What she was doing was&#160;trying to stop&#160;a young girl who had her friend with her in the center, with an older woman waiting for&#160;them outside, which I thought was the mother of this young girl.&#160; I later realized that I was wrong.&#160; Sheila told me that she was scheduled for an abortion this afternoon so I brought her into my office &amp; showed her some graphic pictures on the wall.&#160; It showed how an abortion was done in the 1st. Trimester &amp; what the baby looked like after the abortion.&#160; She was taken back at what she saw.&#160; I also showed her the Growth &amp; Development pictures of her precious little baby &amp; gave her a rubberized model of what her baby looks like now.&#160; I said for her to just "go home" &amp; not to do this to her baby &amp; to herself.&#160; I was so&#160;hopeful that she wouldn't go through with the abortion, for she saw the truth of what an abortion looked like, but I was wrong, for I was told&#160;when she left Focus&#160;her &amp; her girlfriend went right over to Planned Parenthood with the older woman, who apparently had called her on her cell phone, while she was there talking to Sheila &amp; I in the center.&#160; We were very sad to know that they&#160;went into the Killing Mill but I was also hopeful that she'd wouldn't go through with it after seeing the truth &amp; would come out &amp; go home, with her baby still in her womb.&#160; I was wrong, for many hours later&#160;her &amp; the girlfriend &amp; the older woman came out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She was barely walking to the car &amp; as I saw her I said "I told you not to do it" to which she gave me her middle finger &amp; she literally crawled into the back seat by herself.&#160; As the car was coming out of the driveway I looked at the woman driver &amp; told her, point blank, that she will be held responsible for ruining the lives of these two girls, to which she gave me her middle finger, as she was pulling out onto the street.&#160; I hollered out "repent you witch". &#160;(I try not to call names out on the front lines but sometimes I do &amp; today I did it several times &amp; I asked the Lord to forgive me in the Sacrament of Confession, for I want to represent Christ out there on the street.) &#160;This precious baby was just sacrificed to Satan like all aborted babies are.&#160;

Martha wasn't coming back to Focus after the arbitration.&#160; I received a phone call from her earlier this morning, at home,&#160;stating that her daughter's husband's ex wife's son, from a previous marriage, who he&#160; had adopted,&#160;had been shot to death last night on Rosemary St., at his mother's house.&#160; Martha wanted to be with her family after the meeting with the police woman today.&#160; I respected her wishes.&#160;

They were getting impatient so after everyone had left I brought them into the&#160; Pregnancy Testing Room to give the one girl the pregnancy test.&#160; She said that her friends could stay with her.&#160; As I was giving her the test I asked if she was abortion minded &amp; she said "no".&#160; Thank God, someone not wanted to kill her baby, refreshing, to say the least.&#160; As we waiting for the results I talked to the girls &amp; gave the one girl some informative literature to take with her.&#160; I briefly mentioned the murder on Rosemary St. of Aaron Young.&#160; One of the girls said that she lives on that street &amp; that she saw Aaron on the scooter about an hour before he was shot.&#160; I asked her if she would call 311(a&#160;city number that you would call instead of 911 to report information)&#160;to give this information to the police &amp; she said that she would.&#160; The pregnancy test was negative &amp; the three girls went into the Material Aid Room to get a couple of things before they left.&#160; Later on I called 311 &amp; then Crime Stoppers &amp; then the Investigator on the case to give them the information about Aaron was on the scooter before he was shot.&#160; I thought that maybe this was the motive of the murder to steal the scooter.&#160; Later on I found out that he went to his mother's house where there was a party going on &amp; was he was shot there.&#160;The neighbors heard the&#160;three shots &amp; called the police &amp;&#160;when the police got there people where jumping out of the windows but they caught some of them &amp; arrested them.&#160; Aaron died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.&#160; The para medics told the family that&#160;Aaron was talking to someone before he died they believed that he was talking to God.&#160; This gave the family a great deal of comfort.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">Paul was now in the center along with Alexis, our new helper.&#160;

Bill was still across the street &amp; Rob was still at his post, witnessing to everyone who was driving in, &amp; pleading with them on the mega phone, not to have their baby killed.&#160; I took the mega phone &amp; the graphic sign &amp; started to witness &amp; to speak, to the people,&#160;on occasion.&#160; I saw that there was a man with a young child in a stroller walking up &amp; down the Planned Parenthood sidewalk.&#160; I called over to him asking him to go in there to save his other child, this child's brother or sister.&#160; I pleaded with him over a very long time.&#160; I said that he was stupid for what he was doing.&#160; Finally the wife or girlfriend came walking out with a brown bag in her hand, which is filled with contraceptives &amp; paper work.&#160; He then walked over to me, where I was standing by the fence,&#160;&amp; as he was approaching me I told him that I would call the police if he comes near me.&#160; He then said that he was going to call the police because I told him he was "stupid".&#160; I said that wasn't a crime &amp; I apologized &amp; said that I didn't harass him because I never threatened his life.&#160; Rob came over to protect me &amp; to give me support.&#160; As they drove out I said "God bless you", thinking that maybe she didn't have an abortion &amp; he gave me his middle finger.&#160; I had told him that abortion would effect him too plus his child in the car &amp; also&#160;his relationship with this woman &amp; that it might not last, if she had an abortion today.&#160;

I was devastated to think that we&#160;could be getting sick &amp; the carpets won't be laid down today for the center is a mess.&#160; I do so want to get back to normal with the new carpet.&#160; I called Martha &amp; she told me that she opened the door for the carpet men this morning &amp; then went back home &amp; called the Department of Health.&#160; I said that was fine because we might have a bigger problem on our hands if mold is involved.&#160; I met with her later at Mass.&#160; The carpet guys pulled up the carpets &amp; went to another job &amp; said that they would be back on Thursday.&#160; What!!!&#160; Thursday!!&#160; That's not going to work out for that day is very stressful because there are killing precious babies over at Planned Parenthood&#160; &amp; we need to be out on the front lines.&#160; After Mass&#160;I pulled into&#160;our parking lot &amp; there was Bernie, our Landlord, standing by the door.&#160; "Hi Mary", he says "How are you"?&#160;

told them to come&#160;back tomorrow&#160;for then the floor would be dry &amp; they can put the carpet down then.&#160; I was relieved to hear this too.&#160; Thank you Lord for working this all out for good!!!&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Martha &amp;

I said that was great Carole &amp; thank for letting me know this information.&#160; She then left &amp; I decided to join them on the front lines, with the mega phone.&#160; I was by myself by the side where the bushes are, Martha was at the brick side of the building &amp;

the woman hollered to me "It's my Body &amp; my Choice".&#160; "No it's not" I called back to her. &#160;I said "It's a&#160;baby &amp; why would you do that (meaning having an abortion) to you body, don't you care about your body"?&#160;&#160;&#160;Off they went down the street....how sad!&#160;&#160; Martha came over to where I was standing &amp; a few minutes later a young man smoking a long&#160; tin cigar came around the bushes where we were both standing. I got my cell phone ready &amp; when he came around the bushes I took his picture.&#160; He asked why I took his picture &amp; I told him it was because many people threaten us so I wanted your picture just in case, for a back up.&#160; "Okay" he said &amp; started talking to Martha &amp; I.&#160; The first thing he asked was "how many children have been killed by abortion".&#160; I said "over 56 million".&#160; He then said "did you know that Hitler's mother wanted an abortion &amp; someone talked her out of it &amp; how many people did he kill, so if she had the abortion then there would have been no Hitler".&#160; Wow I said to my self here we go again with some weird thinking.&#160; I know that I should be more understanding &amp; realize that we all come from different backgrounds &amp; life experiences but this is crazy thinking.&#160; I said "that life Hitler) is still a life &amp; you can't take that life no matter what they do with it, you never do an evil (abortion) to bring out a good (no people being killed by Hitler).&#160; God will work the evil out for good &amp; He is in control.&#160; I asked him how do you determine who is going to do what when they grow up to abort them now in the womb??&#160; He couldn't answer me.&#160; We asked him what he was doing at Planned Parenthood where they kill children.&#160; He said that his girlfriend was here for birth control so she wouldn't have an abortion.&#160; How wrong is that statement.&#160; Woman who are on birth control are more apt to have an abortion, if they get pregnant, &amp; they can get pregnant&#160;on birth control, than a woman or girl who isn't on birth control.&#160; The reason is that the female on birth control is stating that she doesn't want a baby &amp; if she gets pregnant then she will make that happen, by having an abortion.&#160; He looked a little green at this statement &amp; was&#160;puffing his cigar a little faster.&#160; He then said to me "why do you wear so much make up, the lipstick &amp; all, maybe your husband doesn't mind"&#160; I let that one go.&#160; Then religion came up in the conversation &amp; Martha asked if he was a Catholic &amp; he said that he was. &#160;I said "do you realize fornicating&#160;is a Mortal Sin (deadly sin to one's own soul &amp; if you die in a Mortal Sin you could end up in Hell for all Eternity).&#160; He looked at us &amp; said "I go to Confession &amp; then to Mass &amp; Holy Communion &amp; then&#160;during the week I have sex again.&#160; Martha said to him "beware of the near occasion of sin".&#160; I said to him that you are making a mockery of the Sacrament &amp; you are in presumption of God's&#160;forgiveness, for you have to be truly sorry for your sins, &amp; try not to repeat them, through the grace of God &amp; through daily&#160;prayer &amp; the Sacraments, that give you strength to avoid temptation.&#160; He said that his girlfriend was not a believer in God.&#160; I said "then maybe you should get yourself a girlfriend that is a Catholic so that you would be evenly yoked in your relationship for you will want her soul saved &amp; she will want the same for you because you care &amp; respect each other &amp; the teachings of the Catholic Church".&#160; He said that&#160;the priest in Confession didn't say not to have sex.&#160; I said that was a given, he doesn't need to tell you that for you to know it's wrong.&#160; He must know that it's wrong otherwise he wouldn't be going to Confession.&#160;&#160; He is young &amp; confused in this time of his life.&#160; Martha asked him his name so that&#160;she could pray for him &amp; he said "no, that's okay".&#160; She asked again &amp; he said that is name is Aaron.&#160; Martha gasped for her daughter's husband's son, from a previous marriage, whose name&#160;is Aaron was shot to death here in Rochester, in his mother's house, a coupleof weeks ago.&#160; I was gasping to because that was the name that I chose for my son, who I miscarried along with his twin sister, after the gang rape at the Strong Memorial Hospital back in 1971.&#160; For this touched, our hearts,&#160;both mine&#160;&amp; Martha.&#160; We offered him a Truth pack, he&#160;surprised us&#160;by&#160;taking it,&#160;&amp; also a&#160;Devotional Book of the Catholic Church too.&#160; Martha &amp; I were very happy at that point.&#160;

not die here today at Planned Parenthood".&#160; I offered him a Truth packet to give her &amp; he said "no the guy over wanted to give me the packet to but I don't want it".&#160; I then took out the Grow &amp;

walked back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was praying to the Blessed Mother for Extraordinary Graces to be given to her &amp; to all the mothers in there that they wouldn't have their babies&#160;killed.&#160; It was about 10 minutes later &amp; I saw that this young man was outside sitting on the bench.&#160; I spoke to him again &amp; he finally went back into the Killing Mill.&#160; It was about 4pm that they left.&#160; It was only a little more than an hour that they were in there.&#160;It usually takes 2 or more hours for an abortion &amp; recovery to take place before they leave the parking lot. &#160;As&#160;they drove out the guy that Rob &amp; I had been talking to slowed down near me, on the sidewalk,&#160;I said to her "I hope that you didn't have your baby killed".&#160; Off they went down the street.&#160; After that I had one attack after another, which gave me hope that the devil was mad that he didn't get that little precious baby.&#160; A car filled with young people drove pass me &amp; hollered &amp; I said "repent".&#160; A few minutes later the car came back over to my side &amp; the young girl driver said something very bad to me.&#160; I answered back to her&#160;saying "I love you".&#160; I could see her head twist for I don't think that she expected to hear that.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that&#160;today their lives will change, though the grace of God.&#160;

She called me back about 5 minutes later &amp; told me that you have to call 211 &amp; they tell you where to go for food but she said that she had been there already this month&#160;&amp; that the Catholic Family Center didn't answer so she had to leave a message on the machine for a call back, which probably won't happen.&#160; I asked her for her name &amp; phone number &amp; if I could reach her in the next 5 minutes &amp; she said that I could.&#160; I decided to take a chance in calling Martha to see if she was available, to go to the center, to service our mother of 4 of her own children &amp; 2 of her brothers children, a total of 6 children under her care, with food from our&#160;humble food shelves.&#160; I called her &amp; she said that she would go to the center &amp; I told her that I would meet her there.&#160; She said that Frank &amp; Aaron have the truck &amp; a dolly to pick up the refrigerator that was given to us by Geoff, at the&#160;&#160; Recreational Center.&#160; I said I have to make one stop &amp; then I'll meet you at the center.&#160; I hung up &amp; called the mother back&#160;&amp; asked her to come to the center by 2pm to receive some food for her family.&#160; She said "thank you, I'll be there at 2".&#160; &#160;I was in so much pain &amp; could hardly walk from all the bending I had to do&#160;this week at the center in trying to clean it up.&#160; It affects my right leg with the nerve root problem at L5 from the Wortman injury back in 1988 plus the Fibromyalgia too.&#160; But I have no time to feel sorry for myself especially when our moms need us &amp; we need to get the donated refrigerator in the center too.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">On my way I stopped at a Second Hand Store, on the way to the center, to see if they had a piece of furniture for the office so that I could put things away, for we had to throw away the moldy broken desk that was there before the flood.&#160; I hoped &amp; prayed for a piece of furniture that had some shelves &amp; some drawers &amp; had a nice top to it.&#160; I found it at this store &amp; got a discount to boot on it.&#160; The Focus Center&#160;bought it &amp; they put it in the car &amp; it fitted perfectly.&#160; I got to the center 5 minutes later.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">Martha had just returned from taking the mother home because she had to many bags to carry.&#160;&#160;</span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">When Martha was taking to her for awhile she had mentioned that she was once a Catholic but she left the church when someone told her to talk her crying child out for she was disturbing the Mass.&#160; Maybe they were telling her to take the child to the 'Crying Room", which most churches have for the children.&#160; Well she must have taken a burn for she said that she never went back to church again.&#160; Oh how said to hear this.&#160; There is never a reason to leave the one true Catholic Apostolic Church.&#160; She also shared with Martha that she had an abortion in the past, so I hope that she went to Confession before she left the church if not I hope &amp; pray that she will come back to the Catholic Church for she needs to go to Confession for the abortion &amp; not going to Mass over these past years, which is a serious sin.&#160; Martha mentioned that she was walking distance to Our Lady of the Americas Church on East Main St..&#160; I hope that she goes back to church &amp; receive the Sacrament s for herself &amp; her children, which have not been baptized.&#160; Oh Lord please help her.&#160; I intend to sent her some information.&#160; She also told Martha that she will be back to Focus again to get some winter clothes for her children.&#160; Oh yea!!&#160;&#160; We at Focus try to help the Body &amp; the&#160;Soul, of our clients.&#160;</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt"><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font><br /></span></span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">The guys were there, at Focus, with&#160;the donated refrigerator with all the mold spores at the bottom of the refrigerator.&#160;

they asked me to call the man at the Recreational Center first.&#160; I did &amp; he said to come &amp; get the other refrig&#160;&amp; not to bring back the one that we took.&#160; That's fair.&#160; Dan, the Realtor up the hall,&#160;saw the two refrigerators &amp; asked to take them so that he can give then to his tenants.&#160; We said "sure Dan they're both yours".&#160; Off we went to get the other refrig &amp; brought it back to the center &amp; plugged it &amp; we are still waiting for it to get cold.&#160; On Monday&#160;I'll have to call the repairman to come to see what the problem is with this refrig &amp;

one was Carolyn, the great grandmother that I spoke to earlier on the phone,&#160;to get some diapers for her great grandson &amp; the other was a woman who came in &amp; asked for all the pro life literature we had on abortion, for she had 3 abortions, in the past,&#160;&amp; thinks that she's pregnant again &amp; she doesn't want to be tempted to kill again for she said to Martha that <span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="background-color: #ffffff">"</span></span><span style="color: #800000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="background-color: #ffffff">it </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="background-color: #ffffff">was easy to kill"</span></span></span>&#160;&amp;

We need volunteers, to help us at Focus, so that we can be open on Monday,&#160; Tuesday, Wednesday&#160;&amp; Friday mornings&#160;or afternoons, for at least 4 to 6 hours, each day, to help our girls.&#160;

I was walking with Martha to the parking lot &amp; I saw 2 women with a baby in a stroller across the street.&#160; I wanted&#160; them to have a Rosary &amp; our Focus brochure, so I walked over to them to offer them one.&#160; The mother was walking her baby with an older woman, maybe the baby's grandmother.&#160; The older woman said "yes I'd like a Rosary to put around my neck".&#160; I said that it was for praying &amp; not for wearing.&#160; I let them pick out the color that they wanted &amp; one&#160; older woman asked for one for her&#160;husband.&#160; I said "sure".&#160; Then the mother asked for one for her 6 month old baby.&#160; I said "no, it's a piece of jewelry but a prayer &amp; your baby is to young now".&#160; Then we started to talk.&#160; It went well for a few minutes&#160;&amp; then it got upsetting.&#160; She said that she had gone to Planned Parenthood &amp; all they wanted was to end her pregnancy &amp; they wouldn't help her if she continued&#160;her pregnancy. &#160;I thought that the young mother was 'pro life' then she said something so weird to me.&#160; She said "I know that Catholics are pro life but I'm a Christian &amp; I'm pro choice".&#160; I almost flipped when I heard her say this strange &amp; inaccurate remark.&#160; I told her that you can't be a Christian if you're pro choice, for God said in His Commandments "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160; I can only wonder now if she had an abortion in her past &amp; is trying to justify it, which you can never.&#160; I said that the baby' heart is beating at 18-21 days after conception &amp; she was arguing that too, saying that&#160;it was 24 weeks, where did she get that?&#160; Another thing that she said that she believes in abortion if the girl was raped or incested.&#160; Where is this conversation going,&#160; I said to myself, before I had to go to the center.&#160; I said&#160;that the baby shouldn't&#160;be killed&#160;for the crime/sin of the father &amp; that the mother becomes a murder rather than a rape survivor &amp; her life will miserable.&#160; I said that the pregnant mother can get through the trauma of rape &amp; incest through good counseling &amp; support from good people.&#160; Earlier she said that if the girls knew that they could get help maybe they wouldn't go for an abortion.&#160; I said that&#160;she only has to open up a Phone Book to find a Pregnancy Help Center to assist&#160;her with her pregnancy.&#160; I said that I had to go now.&#160; I&#160;was happy that the older woman seemed not to agree with the younger girl.&#160; I said to them that 'education &amp; prayer' are the answers &amp; have a great day &amp; I left to go to the center.&#160; Martha had left earlier so she was there by now.&#160; I am already worn out before&#160; I got to the center but was glad for the opportunity to give someone the Truth even though they don't agree, at this time.&#160; At least a 'seed'&#160; was planted, sometimes the earth is a little&#160;harder.&#160; I pray that someone will come to water the seed now for the harvest to grow.&#160; Thank you Lord &amp; I hope that they will come to Focus sometime to continue the conversation for now they know where we're located.</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>I got to the center &amp;

he&#160;was having the carpets shampooed &amp; he didn't want the stroller in the hallway so she picked up her baby &amp; left the stoller outside &amp; they went into the Material Aid Room to get some&#160;nice things.&#160; They were there at 12:45pm &amp; I asked for a few minutes to get some things done first for we are open from 1pm to 6pm. We took them right into the center after Martha &amp; got some things out of our cars first.&#160;The carpet guys were coming to fix the problem in the Rose Room &amp; to put strips down by the doorways.&#160; Thank God that Bernie&#160;was there &amp; when the carpet men came he was&#160;able to talk to them about the carpet, only to find out that the carpet men didn't do anything wrong in the Rose Room.&#160; The problem was that there were 2 carpets that were put&#160;down, on top of each other, before &amp; that's why&#160;the carpet&#160;looks the way it does now.&#160; Oh well!&#160;&#160;I called Jason, at Christian&#160;Flooring, for the men's earnings were held until I called to say that the job was done &amp; that they did a good job, to boot.&#160; I&#160;called &amp; now they will get paid.&#160; So many problems but the Lord delivers us out of them all.&#160; The next problem was that the refrig, that we got on Friday,&#160;is still not working &amp; we need to buy another one tomorrow.&#160; That's something I didn't want to do but I have no chose, for we need a refrigerator, at the center.&#160; Tim is coming&#160;by tomorrow &amp; he is our last hope to see what the problem might be with the donated refrigerator.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Carole had now arrived.&#160;

go out by herself.&#160; I said that I will try to join you as soon as I could get out there.&#160; I trusted the Lord that she would be fine.&#160; Later on I found that she was standing across the street which was a good position to take.&#160; She said that a car had stopped to talk to her &amp; said that she loved Planned Parenthood &amp; that they helped her.&#160; Oh yeah, that's what you think now until you wake up, I thought o myself when she told me.&#160;

I told Martha that I was heading out &amp; she was busy putting bags of clothes away.&#160; As I was leaving with the literature box &amp; the one graphic sign &amp; the mega phone I saw that there were 2 young girls heading into the center.&#160;

Now I was deciding to go back into the center to&#160;help Martha out but again I knew that she could handle the situations that were occurring.&#160; I decided&#160; that I needed to be with Carole now, on the front lines.&#160;

I asked her not to come back here again, for their kill little babies.&#160;Then I asked her if needed anything for her baby &amp; she&#160;said that she did, so I told her to go into the center where Martha could help her.&#160; She said that was the nice lady that took her&#160;home that day.&#160;I think it was Donna who took her home that day, it was awhile ago. So off she went to Focus&#160;to get some nice baby items.&#160; I pray that&#160;she will never come back to Planned Parenthood again.&#160; Sweet girl &amp; I hope that her mother is doing fine also.&#160;

I was torn to stay outside to be with Carole on the front lines, with is in my heart, or to be with Martha helping her out in the center.&#160; I knew that Martha could handle anything so I stayed where I was on the sidewalk.&#160; Finally around 4 pm Carole had to leave so I decided to go into the center at that time rather be by myself out on the crazy front lines.&#160; I handed out a Truth packet to a young girl that had stopped her car along side of me after leaving Planned Parenthood.&#160; I asked her why she was there as I was handing her the packet of information&#160;&amp; she said "for birth control'.&#160; I said that in the packet there was a lot of information for her to read &amp; that it sometimes acts as an abortifiacant &amp; can cause breast cancer &amp; heart disease too.&#160; She said that she had a baby recently &amp; I said "congratulations" to her &amp; that she wasn't married then she mustn't have sex &amp; if she was married then be open for children for God is in control.&#160; She smiles at me &amp; said thank you &amp; then drove away.&#160; I felt good about her response to what I was trying to tell her.&#160; The Lord &amp; Mother Mary will help her to what is right &amp; good.&#160; After she left I left to go into the center to be with Martha to help her out before our '40 Days for Life' meeting at 7pm.&#160;

smells better now&#160;with new indoor/outdoor carpets in the 3 rooms to replace the old ones, &amp; then our refrigerator conked out on us.&#160; But things are looking up for us today&#160;for when Martha &amp;

Martha stopped to talk to her, out on the front lines,&#160;&amp; then brought her into the Focus Center &amp; counseled her &amp; gave her literature.&#160; Well, the twin girls are about 8 months old now &amp; are as cute as can be.&#160; Praise God!!&#160;&#160; It was so nice of the Lord to show us our babies &amp; your babies too.&#160; Thank you for all your love, prayers &amp; support to Focus, so we can help people in need.</font></strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><div>&#160;<div><div><div><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: medium">Thursday, September 1, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">When I arrived I spoke with Sheila for a few minutes &amp; she gave me a run down of what had transpired over the past couple of hours in front of Planed Parenthood.&#160; She mentioned that she had spoken to a 17 year old young man &amp; he said that his 17 year old girlfriend was in there having an ultrasound done &amp; that they won't do that, having an abortion.&#160; Sheila mentioned to him that on Thursdays Planned Parenthood does abortions all day.&#160; He went back into Planned Parenthood &amp; was there for about 15 minutes &amp; then came back outside &amp; when Sheila called him back over to speak to her, he refused to come back over to speak with her.&#160; I feel that's because he learned the truth &amp; was very devastated by what he found out when he went back into the Killing Mill.&#160; She asked me to try to give him the Project Rachel brochure when they leave, he's was wearing an orange shirt, she said.&#160; I said that I would try but unfortunately I was called into the center at 1:45pm &amp; when I came back out to the front lines, the car that Sheila pointed out to me, was gone.&#160; Sorry Sheila, that I wasn't there when they left.&#160; The girlfriend, for I felt that the boyfriend didn't really know what she was going to do, is at the Mercy of God.&#160; I pray that he will recover from the shock of being deceived &amp; losing his precious child today.&#160; What pain people are experiencing by abortion.&#160; Abortion effects so many people especially distant family members but especially the siblings, the brothers or sisters or both, lost in their lives growing up.&#160; Never experiencing their sibling or siblings, in their lives, &amp; the interaction of their relationships.&#160; What a tragic loss &amp; the survivor guilt of the sibling is mind boggling.&#160; Why me ?&#160; Why was I spared?&#160; Why wasn't I the one aborted?&#160; I could have been the one aborted &amp; not be here at this time?&#160; Why would my mother do that?&#160; How could she?&#160; It just goes,on &amp; on &amp; on.&#160; Much healing has to be experienced by the surviving sibling to have a normal life.&#160; The loss is excruciating. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
Martha, Adolf, Bill &amp; I were out on the front lines praying &amp; calling out to the people going into Planned Parenthood, &amp; giving them information about their baby &amp; themselves too.&#160; We offered them help with their pregnancies &amp; that they we not alone &amp; that their baby had a heartbeat &amp; that abortion stops a beating heart &amp; please don't trust Planned Parenthood &amp; there is a pregnancy center right next to this yellow building &amp; they can help you, etc..&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160; <br />
I saw that a young man was talking to a woman in a car smoking &amp; I asked him if he was here having his baby killed.&#160; He looked straight at me with his thumb up.&#160; I nearly threw up.&#160; This is the most evil place on the face of the earth &amp; hardly anyone seems to care!!!!&#160;&#160; You don't see these killings on CNN.&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160; <br />
It was now time for the cars to come out after they had an abortion this afternoon &amp; one car after another did.&#160; One young girl was waiting by the front door, with her brown bag (which PP gives the girls after the abortion which has condoms &amp; literature in it) in her hands, waiting to be picked up.&#160; Just then a car drove into the parking lot &amp; stopped &amp; she got in.&#160; As the car was coming out I saw that there were two older women in the front seat &amp; I told them that they were both an accessory to murder.&#160; The passenger, in the car, just looked at me &amp; then the car drove away.&#160; Lord have mercy on their souls.&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
I looked across the street only to see that Jim, who owns the condo, across the street, was spying on us.&#160; I saw him looking at us in his bedroom window.&#160; How icky.&#160; I waved to him &amp; said "hi".&#160; A few minutes later I saw that he was gone.&#160; Jim, now that you are retired, please try to do something better with your time &amp; life, maybe you can join us on the sidewalk, across the street to where you live, in front of Planned Parenthood, a Killing Mill, &amp; save lives!!&#160; How sad.<br />
&#160;<br />
A man on a bicycle stopped to ask me some questions.&#160; I answered them &amp; he was satisfied with the answers.&#160; I always ask the Holy Spirit to assist me at all times.&#160;&#160; <br />
A car had pulled out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I said "I hope that you didn't have your baby killed".&#160; The passenger in the car threw out the window, at me, the condoms that were in her bag that they give you after you have an abortion.&#160; There were about 6 of them in a row.&#160; I picked them up off the street, for I didn't want anyone else to pick them up &amp; use them.&#160; I knew that she was post abortive &amp; I pray that she &amp; the driver of the car repents.&#160;&#160; <br />
The neighbor, who we have had to deal with these past going on 16 years, came walking down the sidewalk with her dog, on a leash.&#160; I tried to make sure that the dog didn't pee on any of our signs, which has happened in the past.&#160; I felt his cold nose against my leg as they walked by.&#160; I don't hold any animosity towards the dog.&#160; Another pro lifer &amp; I pray for her conversion daily.&#160; I don't know what happened to her that she acts the way that she does towards us pro lifers.&#160; She's made it clear that she is 'pro death'.&#160; My landlord knows her, for he said that she has lived next to Planned Parenthood, for the past 20 years. Icky, no wonder she is what she is, living right next to a place where they are killing people all the time!&#160; I wish that our landlord was a believer, in the Lord, &amp; that he would also pray for her, but we are praying for him to know the Lord too. <br />
I went back into the center again to say hi to Suzanne, our Thursday Client Advocate, &amp; to get a drink.&#160; She got her hair cut that's why she was late today.&#160; Her hair looked marvelous &amp; it suited her pretty face.&#160; Thank God that Paul was in the center putting away the many bags of donations that we have recently received.&#160; I went back out to tell Martha that Paul had bought her a chicken sandwich &amp; French fries, from Wendy's, so she went into the center to gobble up her lunch &amp; then she came back out to pray &amp; to witness once more. <br />
Everyone had left, on the front lines, &amp; it was late so Martha &amp; I went back into the center to get supper &amp; to get ready for our 3rd. Focus Board Meeting, of the year.&#160; It was from 6pm to 7pm &amp; we were voting Patricia in, as our new board member.&#160; The meeting was well attended &amp; went very well, which pleased me to no end.&#160; After the meeting Pat stayed to help me put away some more children's clothes, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I was so sad that I didn't make the Fatima Prayer Group, at St. Jude's Church tonight.&#160; God comes first, I need to remember this!&#160; Everything else can wait, for there will be another time to finish these projects.</span></div><span style="font-size: large">&#160;<hr /></span><div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;<div><span style="font-size: small"><font face="Arial"><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Arial">Wednesday, September 7, 2011 at Focus</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Martha &amp; I stayed in the center &amp; did a lot of work!!!&#160; I picked up the DVD's &amp;&#160;CD's that Father burns for us &amp; bought a new printer/copier.&#160; Bill came by &amp; he tried to fix it but said that&#160;the motor was shot.&#160;The one that I bought will be more affordable in the end.&#160; Martha wasn't feeling good so I told her to go lie down on the new sofa.....she slept like a baby.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Moms came indoor children's clothes &amp; we helped in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Sandy came by to help us &amp; to tell s that her car isn't working to well &amp;&#160;that her job is not what she thought it would be but she's grateful to have one.&#160; </span></div><hr /><p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Arial">Thursday, September 8, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood<span id="1315785602984S" style="display: none">&#160;</span><span id="1315785621620S" style="display: none">&#160;</span></span></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Happy Birthday Mother Mary!!!!</span></span></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><div><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><font face="Arial">This is Sheila's experiences on the front lines</font></strong></span></span></div></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">As usual, Pat and Bill were praying outside PP at 10:30.

I was told the bad news.&#160;&#160;Her friend&#160;went through with the abortion yesterday.&#160; Her friend's boyfriend Hank came home around 3am while Miss M. was sleeping on the couch &amp; he told her that he wanted to talk to her &amp; that he&#160;had a gun in his pocket.&#160; Miss M.&#160;got up &amp; went right out the front door,&#160;of the apartments on Franklin St., downtown.&#160;&#160;&#160;Miss M.&#160;went to her car &amp; texted her girlfriend, who was in the apartment &amp; told her what had just happened, &amp; that she needed her clothes.&#160; She later texted her back &amp; told her that her things were at the front door for pick up.&#160; Then Miss M. called the police &amp; asked if an officer would go with her to the apartment to get her things &amp; that it wasn't an emergency but that the guy in the apartment was crazy &amp; that she was afraid.&#160; A police officer came an hour later to help her to get her things &amp; then&#160;off she went back to Virginia at 5am &amp; drove non stop to get back home.&#160; She thinks that&#160;her friend went ahead with the abortion that day.&#160; I talked with her on the phone to try to comfort her for&#160;she tried so hard to talk her friend out of the abortion but the new boyfriend wanted her to have it, like most women she listened to him, the messenger of death &amp; destruction.&#160; Her friend was post abortive &amp; usually if the first abortion wasn't dealt with then there is usually a second, third or fourth abortion......&#160;&#160;&#160;Now please continue to pray for this young lady Miss M., who is suffering from her friends decision to have the abortion.&#160; Also, please pray for the girl that had the abortion &amp; her boyfriend that wanted her to have the abortion that they will repent.&#160; Thank you &amp; God bless you for praying &amp; know that any prayer said is never wasted.&#160; &#160;Please keep on praying &amp; never give up!&#160;&#160;&#160;Jesus is Lord!! </span></span><font face="Arial"><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;<font face="Times New Roman">&#160;</font></span></div></font></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">When I arrived I was so trying to drop off some things in the center before going out to greet Sheila &amp; the prayer warriors but just as I was leaving a couple of moms came in to get some things in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Thank God Paul had just come back from his lunch break foe he's with Sheila on the front lines in the late morning early afternoon with her.&#160; I asked if he could help the moms &amp; their children in the Material Aid Room while I headed outside to be on the front lines.&#160; He said that he would but first he handed me a bag of food, from Wendy's for Martha &amp; I.&#160; I thanked him &amp; off I went with the literature box &amp; some graphic signs.&#160; Just as I was walking in the parking lot there was Suzanne driving in.&#160; She was early today so I told her as she was getting out of her car that some people were already in the Material Aid Room.&#160; She said 'okay' &amp; off I went to join the team on the sidewalk.&#160; Martha wasn't there yet but I knew that she was coming soon.&#160; I walked over to Sheila &amp; said "hi" &amp; gave her a hug then I said 'hi" to Dan, Addison &amp; Maryann too.&#160; Sheila&#160;gave me a run down of what had happened on her time on the sidewalk &amp; said that Bill &amp; Pat, who were out there earlier saying the&#160;Rosary &amp; calling out to the girls to offer them help, said that there was an&#160;Fire Truck there earlier,&#160;at Planned Parenthood's parking lot, &amp; people were being evacuated out of the building.&#160;&#160;Pat &amp; Bill&#160;weren't told anything by the firefighters &amp; after a short time the Planned Parenthood people&#160;were told that they&#160;could go back into the Killing Mill again.&#160;All clear of what we don't know.&#160; I talked to Sheila for a few more minutes then said "good bye" to her &amp;&#160;said that would call her soon.&#160; Before she left she said that she was going to call our 'post abortive grandmother' who brought her daughter here to Planned Parenthood a couple of months ago to have&#160;her grandchild be murdered by Rachael Phelps, the abortionist, here.&#160;&#160;Her &amp; daughter, who both have had abortions, are in great pain &amp; the mother of the daughter called me asking to be connected with Sheila, to talk to her, for she found her very nice &amp; helpful.&#160;&#160;Sheila said that she will call her soon.&#160; In the mean time I called Kathy who is post abortive &amp; has been in the healing &amp; forgiveness process for many years &amp; is a part of the "Silent No More Awareness Campaign' @ </span></span><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><a href="http://www.silentnomoreawareness.org/"><u><font color="#810081">http://www.silentnomoreawareness.org/</font></u></a>.&#160; So she said that she will also call the mother, who has had an abortion in the past</span></span></font></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">I noticed that Carole&#160;&amp; Bill weren't there.&#160; I later found out that Bill, our 82 year old Korean War Vet, had fallen just before he was to come to join us in protesting &amp; he had&#160;hit his head, so he was rushed to the hospital via ambulance &amp; had to stay the night in the Intensive Care Unit.&#160; He's home now &amp; is doing better, thank God.&#160; Carole wasn't back from visiting, in another state,&#160;her daughter &amp; her grand daughter, who was born 1lb. 7ozs.(about a year ago) &amp; is doing quite well&#160;except that her eyesight was effected by her birth weight but the family is coping they're just so&#160;happy that she's alive.&#160;&#160;&#160;Martha &amp;&#160;Adolf &#160;just showed up &amp; the rest of the team had gone, for their time was over.&#160; Paul, was in the center working on putting away our many bags of donations &amp; Suzanne, our Client Advocate, was in the center making phone calls to our clients to see how they were doing.&#160; Outside on the street,&#160;Martha went over to the brick side of Planned Parenthood &amp; Adolf was across the street with his sign that read 'Planned Parenthood Kills Babies' &amp; was praying the Rosary &amp; I stayed by&#160;the bush side, of this evil killing camp.&#160; &#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div><div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">I received a call from Alexis, who was caring for a sick Grandmother &amp; she said that she was coming back to us &amp; that she will be there at Focus very soon.&#160; I was glad for I missed her &amp; we also need her very much.&#160; After she worked in the center for while Paul took her home.&#160; How nice of him&#160; for he has been a God sent to us at the center.&#160; He's retired now &amp; can spend some time with us helping us out.&#160; Yeah!!</span></span></div></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">A young man was walking by &amp; asked for the beards, which meant the Rosary.&#160; He said that it was good luck for him.&#160; I said that luck had nothing to do with it for it was a powerful that must be said &amp; not worn as if it was a Good Luck Charm, which it wasn't.&#160; He took one with the directions of the 'How to Say the Rosary' with him &amp; he turned around to ask for one for his mother, which I gave him.&#160; Education is so important to teach people the Truth.&#160; Mother Marry please help this fine young man &amp; his mother to grow closer to you &amp; to your Son, Lord Jesus.&#160; Thank you, Amen.&#160; Just then there was a another young man walking down the sidewalk but I had a bad feeling about him so I decided not to speak to him as he passed by me, for he was talking to himself.&#160; As he walked passed the last graphic sign that was tied up on the post he turned around &amp; spat on it.&#160; I called to him saying that if he had his baby killed by abortion then he needed to ask God to forgive him &amp; to seek out help for he was going no where.&#160; Later on Martha went to the center &amp; got some disinfectant to spray on the sign &amp; wipe the spit away.&#160; Poor aborted babies how even they were killed in such a gruesome way are being abused by man.&#160; Lord have Mercy on this young man &amp; I hope &amp; pray that he will repent soon.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">Martha was now back with me on the side with the tall bushes.&#160; Adolf had to leave &amp; was gone.&#160; Just then a car with 2 girls drove was driving into Planned Parenthood but had to stop to let the car coming down the street pass.&#160; In the meantime the driver rolled down her car window &amp; I said "this is what they do in there",&#160; for I was holding a graphic sign.&#160; She then said to me "I'm going to come back &amp; kill you now you f..... b.... &amp; then drove into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I waited so that I could see what&#160;she was wearing as she &amp; the other girl with her was walking into the door so that I could give a description to the police&#160; when I call&#160;911.&#160; She was blonde&#160;wearing a bright pink top &amp; black pants with a black purse &amp; so was the other girl wearing the same thing but had red hair.&#160; I gave the description to the 911 operator &amp; she said to wait there for the police to arrive.&#160; I said "thank you" &amp; hung up.&#160; Right after that episode another car drove into Planned Parenthood with 2 young girls in the car.&#160; I went over to the fence to show them the graphic picture of what abortion looks like &amp; to offer them help.&#160; The 2 young girls came around the bushes with a precious baby in a stroller.&#160; Martha &amp; I started to talk to them.&#160; Then the girl with the baby said "don't you remember me you told me to go to Dr. N. for my pregnancy &amp; I did I like him so much.&#160; The other girl that she wanted to go into Planned Parenthood, for an ultrasound,&#160;to see how far long she was.&#160; Martha &amp; I said "oh no we'll call Compass Care right now to see if they can see you now for a 'free' ultrasound.&#160; Martha called &amp; she had an appointment&#160;as soon as they could get to the office at 300 White Spruce Blvd., across the street from Monroe Community College.&#160; I said it's just before you get to Dr. N's office you'll find it.&#160; Then one of the girls said "the police&#160;are here".&#160; I walked over to the fence to see that the officer&#160; was walking into Planned Parenthood&#160;&amp; I called over to him saying "officer I was the one who called you not them".&#160; &#160;He walked over to us who was standing on the sidewalk.&#160; He took me aside &amp; asked what had happened &amp; I told him.&#160; Then he asked me what I wanted him to do.&#160; I said "to make out an Incident Report.&#160; He said back to me that he couldn't do that unless he has her arrested, so I said okay then arrest her.&#160; He said "I'm &#160;going into the building &amp; bring her out&#160;so that you can identify her".&#160; I said "okay officer" &amp; off he went back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Another police car had just pulled into the parking lot.&#160; Then I saw that the other police officer, that I had just spoken with, come out of the front&#160;door&#160;&amp; was talking to the other officer that had just showed up.&#160; They were talking on the phone &amp; to each other for about 20 minutes.&#160; Then it dawned on me that they were waiting until the girls abortion was over to talk to her.&#160; Oh my Lord how horrible!!&#160; They were finally lead into Planned Parenthood &amp; then arrested the post abortive girl with the blond hair.&#160;&#160;The police officer came over to me now &amp; told me that he had spoken to her &amp; wrote her out an appearance ticket, for her&#160;to go to court when she was notified.&#160; He handed me&#160;the Criminal Report number &amp; his name on a piece of paper.&#160; Then he asked me my name, birthday, address &amp; phone number &amp; said for me&#160;to wait for a phone call or a&#160;letter, for it will be&#160;the decision of the DA, to what will happen in this case.&#160; I said "okay &amp; thank you officer".&#160; Off he went to his patrol car &amp; drove out &amp; waved at us &amp; so did the other police officer, when he left&#160;too.&#160; You are in our prayers along with all the other police officers, here in Rochester, NY..&#160; As all&#160;this was going on&#160;Martha &amp; I&#160;said "good bye to our 2 young ladies &amp; the precious baby &amp; handed the pregnant mom a Truth packet &amp; a Growth &amp; Development DVD.&#160; They waved good bye, as they drove away,&#160;with a smile on their faces.&#160; I hope &amp; pray all went well &amp; I'm sure that it did at Compass Care, which is terrific!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">After I had called the police I saw a man, up the street looking at us, &amp; I recognized him as Kate's husband, who was bringing non-perishable foods to Focus this afternoon for our Food Shelves, for the people in need,&#160;who come to the center.&#160; I walked up to him &amp; said "hello" he said that he was waiting for his wife I said to him that I was waiting for the police, for my life was just threatened.&#160; I said that Paul &amp; Suzanne were in the center &amp; that they could help with the food delivery when Kate comes.&#160; He said that he talked with them in the center a few minutes ago.&#160; I said "good bye&#160; &amp; please say hi to Kate for me".&#160; He said that he would &amp; I saw that she had come a few minutes later but I was to busy on the front lines to go to talk to her.&#160; I'm sure that she'll understand.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">Martha was bringing the signs &amp; things into the center &amp; I stayed out on the front lines for a little longer by myself. I don't have a Death Wish bit I do have a Life Wish, &amp; I want to stay out there as long as I can to speak Truth to the people &amp; to offer them help.&#160; I saw that a young girl was sitting on the bench in front of Planned Parenthood &amp; I offered her help but I knew that it was to late to save her precious baby for she had been in there for many hours &amp; was carrying the infamous brown paper bag with the all the condoms that she'll need for awhile until her next abortion.&#160; Wen will this behavior stop???&#160; Just then a car pulled into the parking lot &amp; I called out to them &amp; they said that they were just turning around.&#160; I believed them until saw that they were picking up the young girl on the bench.&#160; I told the drivers as they left that they could be accessories to murder.&#160; Lord I hope &amp; pray that they all Repent.&#160; I was wondering if they or to her will be in church on Sunday Praising the Lords after they had just murdered their baby or helped in the murder of the baby of one of their friends or relatives??&#160;&#160;

He was so nice &amp; got it all set up &amp; it works perfectly &amp; will be a blessing in our work at Focus.&#160; When he left the phone didn't work but a few days later the good Lord gave me Elroy the account right nest to my office to figure out the problem &amp;

front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></p><div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">It was so busy from the time I got to the center until I left the center around 9:30pm.&#160; I received a phone call while driving after Mass when I had just turned on my cell phone which I had 'off' during Mass.&#160; I pulled my car along the side of the road &amp; answered the phone.&#160; It was a gentleman who wanted&#160;to come by to donate some baby items to Focus.&#160; I said that I was appreciative &amp; gave him our days &amp; hours that we are open.&#160; He said that he would come by&#160;in the next couple of days with the drop off of things.&#160; I said "thank you" &amp; hung up.&#160; When I got to the center neither Martha nor Paul&#160;were there, so I asked for help from one of the taxi guys, to help me bring things into the center from my car.&#160; It&#160;was Tickaboo, from the&#160;taxi company,&#160;who was kind enough to help me.&#160; We put all the things on the table in the Green Room, which is the All Purpose Room, which means anyone can use it but we use it the most.&#160; All of a sudden there was on of our clients offering to help put things away until she had to pick up her son at 2pm.&#160; I said "sure".&#160; Then Martha came saying that she was trying to go to where her daughter works to tell her of the Mass, on Thursday, that will be dedicated to those who have lost children.&#160; Then Carole came back to us after seeing her daughter &amp; granddaughter, who was born prematurely.&#160; I was glad to see Martha &amp; Carole &amp; to have Donna's help too.&#160;Just then Tim came with a delivery of items for Focus.&#160; This was his second delivery from a&#160;Garage Sale that he went to a couple of week ago where the woman was trying to sell these things but couldn't &amp; gave them to&#160;Focus.&#160; How nice was that.&#160; Tim left the information on my desk in the office for me write a Thank You not&#160;to thank her for her generosity.&#160; As this was going on with Tim bringing these things to Focus his little Margaret Mary, was being prepared for Heart Surgery,&#160;this Thursday.&#160; She is seven years old&#160;&amp; is a sweet&#160;little girl with a&#160;heart defect &amp; hopefully this surgery will cure her &amp; she will go on with a normal life with her family.&#160; She has been in&#160;our hearts &amp; prayers for awhile now &amp; we will continue to pray for her &amp; her&#160;devoted &amp; loving family.&#160; Tim was nice enough to leave me his breakfast pizza for my lunch.&#160; The microwave wasn't working so I had to eat it cold, but it was still good.&#160;

it was heading towards 1:30pm now.&#160; Always something to stress me out.&#160; Then Paul came in&#160;&amp; I was just kidding him&#160;when I said "where&#160;have you been"?&#160; He said back to me "I told you that I was coming today I just didn't say when".&#160; Good answer Paul.&#160; I had just eaten a Mounds candy bar, for my desert, which is Paul's&#160;&amp; mine favorite.&#160; I gave him one as a truce.&#160; I never saw anyone devour a candy bar so fast in my life, even though it was one of those little ones you can eat in one bite.&#160;&#160;I was in the office&#160;when Donna said "there's someone hear&#160;to see you" &amp; in comes Alexis.&#160; I&#160;said to her that I expected her at the center at 1pm, for that&#160;was the agreement.&#160; She said that she had to walk today to get here.&#160; I forgot to ask her why she didn't take the bus.&#160; I did ask her how her grandmother was &amp; she said that she was doing better.&#160; I was glad to hear that.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">Martha &amp; Carole decided that we should stay in the center today&#160;to put things away rather than to go out to the front lines.&#160; We had so&#160;much work in the center,&#160;putting away the summer clothes &amp; putting out the&#160;fall/winter clothes, into the Material Aid Room, that I agreed.&#160; It was mass confusion for we had moms in the Material Aid Room while all this was going on.&#160; I felt badly for one of our&#160;clients has&#160;had so much trauma &amp; loss that it made&#160;my heard spin.&#160; I told her that I pray for all the clients every day &amp; she&#160;said that was appreciative of that.&#160; She said that it's been so horrible that&#160;she needed to get out of her house.&#160; I&#160;was glad that she decided to come to Focus to unwind &amp; to get some nice things for her many children.&#160;Lord please help this fine woman&#160;with&#160;all her pain &amp; sorrow &amp;&#160;the loss of her children, in her life, &amp; now her relatives loss of her&#160;baby too.&#160; Thank&#160;you Lord for healing this family &amp; setting them free, in you!!&#160; Please&#160;deal with the justice of what happened to her friend's baby, that died,&#160;while she was away &amp; had a 17 year boy watch the baby.&#160; Please bring the Truth to your light.&#160; Thank you Lord in giving peace to this mother.&#160; Amen</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">Just then a young girl came in for a pregnancy test which Martha gave.&#160; All of a sudden she came into the office &amp; said "Mary is it positive or negative"?&#160; I looked at the strip &amp; saw two lines &amp; said "yes, your pregnant &amp; congratulations too".&#160; I saw Martha at the office door so I thought that she just wanted confirmation, which I just gave.&#160; I asked if she was abortion minded &amp; she said "no".&#160; She had a girl at home &amp; was hoping that this baby was a boy.&#160;" It&#160;really doesn't matter does it" I said.&#160; Martha continued to assist her &amp; she need the number of the Jordan Health Center for Compass Care was to far away from where she lives.&#160; So I looked it up on the Internet &amp; gave the 2 phone numbers to Martha which she gave to the client to call.&#160; Martha also gave her lots&#160;of information too &amp;&#160; A DVD too.&#160; I gave her 'Healthy Pregnancy' &amp;' What God Says About Abortion' brochures &amp; put&#160;them into her Truth packet.&#160; She couldn't get a hold of the Anthony Jordan Health Center for they had her on hold for a long time.&#160; I asked, as she was leaving. if she wanted to try again now &amp; she said that she will try again when she gets home.&#160; The last thing that I handed her was a Compass Care brochure just in case she couldn't reach the Anthony&#160;Jordan Health Center.&#160; Martha &amp; I said 'good bye" to her &amp; told her that we would call her from time to time to see how she was doing.&#160; Then she left.&#160; I went back to the office to continue to do my paper work when Martha came in &amp; shut the door &amp; told me that she had gone out to her car to get something when she saw that the girl with positive pregnancy test that we just ministered to went to Planned Parenthood &amp; had dropped all that we gave her in the bushes.&#160; My heart sank &amp; then I asked Martha if she would go &amp; say a Rosary out on the front lines right now&#160; she said that she would.&#160; She tool a graphic sign of baby Malachi &amp; her Rosary &amp; her picture of Jesus &amp; went to the sidewalk to pray.&#160; My heart &amp; prayers &amp; concern went with Martha.&#160; Carole &amp; Donna had to leave &amp; Alexis &amp; Paul were very busy with putting away &amp; cleaning up&#160;the donations, that we had received.&#160; I went back to the office &amp; started to make up the Truth packets &amp; do some more office work, with a heavy heart.&#160; </span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">After Martha came back into the center I went out to the front lines.&#160; I was greeted by 2 woman who approached me asking for help.&#160; The older woman, who was the mother of the 19 year old, said that it was hellish in Planned Parenthood &amp; she wanted out of there.&#160; She took her daughter there because she didn't' know&#160;where else to take her for a check up, but she&#160;got the 'willies' when she was in there.&#160; She was glad that I was outside to help them.&#160; I brought them to Focus &amp; Martha took over from there &amp; I went back out to the front lines still hoping to see our client that came to us for a pregnancy test, then went to Planned Parenthood, hopefully not to schedule to have her baby be killed there&#160;this Thursday or any other day.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">I called into the&#160;Planned Parenthood&#160;parking lot to say what I said &amp; to offer help to the people in the building &amp; in the parking lot.&#160; Just then 2 young girls walked over to me from behind the bushes.&#160; They said that they wanted a packet for the other woman had give the one sister one but the other sister wanted one too.&#160; I gave her one &amp; asked&#160;what they were doing in such a horrible place.&#160; The one young girl said that their sister was in there for the Depo shot &amp; it was a good thing because if she gets pregnant again she would only have another abortion, for&#160;she's had 11 abortions, &amp; she's 32 years old.&#160; She has 2 sons &amp; then after they were born she's had one abortion after another.&#160; I said to&#160;them if&#160;they would&#160;follow me I could take them to the center to get them more information about Post Abortion Counseling that&#160;would help&#160;their sister.&#160; They said "yes" &amp; they followed me to Focus where I gave them lots of brochures.&#160; The one married sister said that she's been unable to conceive &amp; I gave her Debbie's &amp; Anne's phone #'s &#160;&amp;&#160;that they could possibly help her, through Natural Family Planning.&#160; They went into the Material Aid Room for clothes for their family members.&#160; Martha was just finishing up with the mother &amp; daughter, that I brought in a little earlier &amp; the daughter now wants to volunteer, at the center.&#160; I gave them some more information &amp; also the '40 Days for Life' flier &amp; invited them to come to the 'Kick Off Rally" in 2 weeks, here at Focus.&#160;&#160; Then the mother said to me that they weren't Christians &amp; I said "but you believe in God don't you"?&#160;&#160; She said "yes".&#160;"That's good", I said.&#160; Then&#160;I said that we don't believe in 'birth control' or 'condoms' or 'sex before marriage' &amp; they both agreed to that.&#160; I said "you passed", to volunteer here at Focus but we still would orientate you.&#160; I gave them the days &amp; hours that we're here &amp; said that you can pick any day &amp; time that would work out for you.&#160; The mom said that her daughter home schools her daughter &amp; that she would take over when she's here at the center.&#160; I said "that sounds like a plan".&#160; I hope that they will come to know, love &amp; serve the Lord in time, &amp; become Christians but in the meantime we are called, as Christians, to love them &amp; to pray for them too.&#160; </span></span></div></span></span></div><div>&#160;&#160;<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div></div><div><div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">Paul, who had called me while I was&#160;driving earlier today,&#160;came to give us a donation &amp;

Thursdays are the killing day at Planned Parenthood, really every day they kill little babies.&#160; I always get sick to my stomach on Thursdays especially.&#160; I was still at home getting ready.&#160; I was going to go to the bank first to deposit the money that we receive from good people that help us to continue our work at Focus, in trying to help people have a better life &amp; to make their burdens a little lighter until they can get both feet on the floor.&#160; After the bank I would be heading to the front lines hopefully by 1pm or earlier, to relieve Sheila, who has been there on the sidewalk starting at 10:30am to 1pm.&#160; Martha &amp; Adolf &amp; Bill &amp; I will then take over to 'fight the good fight', over evil in the name of the Lord.&#160; Just before I left the phone rang &amp; it was Sheila, it was about 11:20am.&#160; She wanted me to talk to the sister of the girl that was in Planned Parenthood.&#160; Her sister came in at 8:30am &amp; was told to shallow 3 pills to start the abortion process which will be completed at 11:30am.&#160; Sheila wanted me to talk with her, for she had been taking with her for awhile, &amp; she didn't want her sister to do this.&#160; She said that Planned Parenthood told her sister that after taking the pills if she changed her mind &amp; not have the abortion that the baby would be retarded or have heart problem or be a Down's Syndrome baby.&#160; I told her to get her sister out of Planned Parenthood &amp; to take her to the nearest Emergency Room, for them to take care of her &amp; to save her baby too.&#160; She said that she would go back into Planned Parenthood &amp; try again. I said "good &amp; I'll keep you in prayer" &amp; hung up the phone.&#160; Then I looked at my TV clock only to see it say 11:28 am.&#160; To late.&#160; Lord have mercy on the death of this precious little baby that we were unable to save from being murdered by the hands of the abortionist, Rachael Phelps &amp; her co horts of evil.&#160; I felt sicker to my stomach as I started to go to the front lines, with one baby already killed, &amp; many more will be also killed this afternoon.&#160; Do you know how difficult this is for us to know that innocent, defenseless children are being killed &amp; there's nothing we can do to stop it but to pray, hope &amp; speaking out to the mothers to try, through the grace of God, to change their minds of having their own child their own flesh &amp; blood, be ripped apart without mercy,&#160; for their convenience.&#160; <br />

When I arrived on the front lines at 1pm Sheila whispered in my ear "she went through with it".&#160; My heart sank again for one always hopes that a 'miracle' will happen &amp; sometimes it does but not today.&#160; Just then a police car drove up to the curb &amp; I looked to see that it was Officer Chris.&#160; I said "hi Officer Chris" &amp; he got out of his vehicle.&#160; He said that an Incident Report was made out &amp; the girl told the officer that she didn't threaten my life but only swore at me when coming into the Planned Parenthood parking lot.&#160; I told Officer Chris that Martha was my witness that this girl indeed threatened my life.&#160; He said&#160; "I know Mary &amp; I'll continue to look into this &amp; I'll get back to you, is there anything else"?&#160; I said "Planned Parenthood is killing babies here today".&#160; He said "yes I know" &amp; put his head down, for he is a good man.&#160; He got back into his car &amp; I told him that we were praying for him &amp; he said "so is my grandmother".&#160; I said "she is a&#160; wonderful woman".&#160; He smiled &amp; rode away.&#160; I feel in my heart that, in this world, she'll get away with what she said to me but not in the next world.&#160; I'll just have to wait for justice until then.&#160; If she was capable of killing her own child, then why wouldn't anyone think that she wasn't capable of killing me too, especially when she said that she was going to????<br />

Martha was in the center &amp; Adolf had to leave &amp; Bill didn't come today, so I was by myself out on the front lines, which always is not good but what can I do when there isn't anyone else to defend life out there.&#160; Where are ALL the people???&#160;&#160; Just then two young people, a man &amp; a woman drove in &amp; got out of their car.&#160; The guy was walking over to me &amp; taking my picture with his cell phone camera.&#160; I saw him through the fence &amp; walking towards me &amp; I said "if you come any closer I'll call the police".&#160; He backed away &amp; while he &amp; his girlfriend, I bet, were walking into Planned Parenthood he said to me "we're going in to make a donation".&#160; I said to him "she's just using you as you're using her, there's no love here only lust".&#160; Then the front door shut behind them.&#160; The Death Escort had left so they had to open the door by themselves.&#160; When they came out about 10 minutes later he said to me "see, that didn't take to long now did it".&#160; I hollered over to him saying "you just put a curse on your finances".&#160; He stopped dead in his track. Oh well that didn't take long now did it.....&#160; When they were driving out he looked a little pale &amp; she had her camera phone taking pictures &amp; she had a sickly smile on her face too. Icky...&#160; I had my cell phone camera ready &amp; I took their pictures too.&#160; For two can play this game too.&#160; I said to them "you're both going to suffer much" as they drove away.&#160; I thought to myself that I usually say to the people to"repent" but it didn't come out of mouth this time, maybe because they left before I could say it.&#160; Lord have Mercy on them &amp; I do hope &amp; pray that they will both be converted &amp; repent &amp; make up for what they did here today, in giving their money, to help to kill more precious voiceless babies.&#160; How sick was that encounter.<br />
&#160;<br />
Martha came out, of the center, &amp; she said that she noticed that the people driving by today were especially hostile.&#160; One driver hollered out his window "kill the babies"!!!&#160; How evil..how sick.&#160; One after another of evil words or dirty gestures, passed us by, on the street today.&#160; We just gave them all to God to deal with them later on.&#160; One girl after another were coming out of Planned Parenthood, after having their baby killed, with their heads down in the car.&#160; It's hard to grasp this concept that their precious baby is now liquefied in a container in the refrigerator in Planned Parenthood ready for Strong Memorial Hospital to pick up &amp; to be sent to the Pathologist &amp; then thrown into the incinerator.&#160; They wouldn't do that to the dogs &amp; cats at the vets across the street, now would they?&#160;&#160; For if they did, they would have the Peta people protesting up &amp; down University Ave.,the abuse of animals, &amp; rightly so.&#160; I have a cat.&#160; Where is the outrage that they are killing people at Planned Parenthood, I only see apathy.&#160; Where are the people protesting this grave evil that is going on at 114 University Ave.?&#160; There is none, only but a few dedicated &amp; blessed prayer people, protesters &amp; sidewalk counselors, who will receive their reward in Heaven someday, for defending the unborn from being killed!!&#160; Thank you &amp; God bless you all..........<br />

There is good news.&#160; I reported that we had a client go into Planned Parenthood on Tuesday after having a positive pregnancy test.&#160; Well, she came back to Focus to get an umbrella stroller &amp; Martha was in the center at that time &amp; asked her why she had gone to Planned Parenthood after leaving us at Focus.&#160; Martha also said that we tried to get a hold of her but couldn't.&#160; She said :I know for my grandmother told me you all called".&#160; Oh yes, next time my dear give us a phone number that we can reach you &amp; not bother your grandmother who told Martha that she hadn't seen you in awhile.&#160; Well she told Martha that after she left us &amp; she couldn't reach anyone at the Anthony Jordan Health Clinic that she would go over to Planned Parenthood to get an ultrasound done to see how far long she was.&#160; She said that she was 5 weeks along &amp; she said that after they did the ultrasound that they asked her if she wanted an abortion.&#160; She told them "no" &amp; got out of there as soon as she could.&#160; Martha &amp; I were out on the front lines waiting for her, to come out of Planned Parenthood, but we had missed her that day.&#160; Martha &amp; I were so happy to hear this great news &amp; that we found our girl &amp; her baby safe &amp; sound.&#160; Yeah!!!<br />
&#160;<br />
I saw one of the men who work for David Gantt, who's office in at the other end of the mall like plaza, that our center is located at.&#160; I said to him "what are you doing to save your race from being killed over there at Planned Parenthood?&#160; I then pointed towards where they were located, as if he didn't know.&#160; He went into the office &amp; shut the door behind him.&#160; How sad is that!!<br />

Martha &amp; were going to eat supper, &amp; then go to a Healing Mass at Holy Apostles Church.&#160; It was a Mass for those who have lost a baby in the womb or outside of the womb.&#160; For each baby or child lost you would light a candle &amp; stick it into the sand by the altar, as a remembrance of the person that is no longer with us but is waiting for us in Heaven.&#160; Symbolism.&#160; We were told to share our loses with the people who were sitting the closest to us.&#160; When I shared that I miscarried twins from a gang rape the one woman said to me that they were probably better off.&#160; I said "what!!&#160; I would have been a good mother &amp; would have taken god care of them"!!&#160; I thought that this was suppose to be a healing service but not for me at this time with such a comment.&#160; She should have said to me "my dear. I'm so sorry for your loss".&#160; Now that would have been healing.&#160; Lord have Mercy on us, for sometimes we say &amp; do things we really don't mean.&#160; I forgave her, for she didn't say it to be mean.&#160; After Mass Martha &amp; I talked in the parking lot for about 10 minutes to review the day &amp; then we went home.&#160; Praise God for this evening of healing by you dear Lord, in receiving&#160; Holy Communion, your Body, Blood, Soul &amp; Divinity.&#160; For you are the Healer &amp; the Deliverer of our pain &amp; loss &amp; anguish.&#160; Amen</span></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /></font></span></font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial"><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tuesday, September, 20. 2011 at Focus</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I woke up today like I was death warmed up.&#160; I  almost didn't make it in today for I felt so badly.&#160; But I must rely&#160;&#160;on the  grace of God.&#160; So I got up &amp; started to get going to get dressed &amp; go to  church, then to the center.&#160; If&#160; I gave into feeling sick all the time I would  be doing nothing in my life to help other or to take care of myself so I thank  God for His graces to keep on going.&#160; Though I'd like to be healed &amp; a  little relieved of the pain &amp; discomfort I'm in all the time.&#160; One  comforting thing is that my suffering is redemptive, for&#160;God's purpose&#160;to be  used to save lives &amp; souls, for Him.&#160; That gives me some comfort.&#160; He is in  control &amp; he knows what I'm going through for He went through worse for me,  on the Cross.&#160; I'm saying this because I feel guilty for I &amp; the team didn't  go out on the front lines this afternoon.&#160; We stayed in the center to do work in  the Material Aid Room putting away summer clothes &amp; putting out the winter  clothes.&#160; I only wish that we had enough people that could be out on the front  lines &amp; in the center to do the work that needs to be done.&#160; Where are you  all, we need you???&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div></font><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Martha came into the office with her mouth open,  taking a Truth packet &amp; getting Post Abortion brochures, from the Rose  Room.&#160; I heard her taking to the girl &amp; I wanted to know more so I got up  out of my chair &amp; went to see what was happening.&#160; I went into the Material  Aid Room &amp; asked her what was going on.&#160; She had a young boy in the stroller  &amp; she said that her sister was at Planned Parenthood having an abortion  &amp; that the nurse told her, the sister,&#160;to take the boy out for he was making  to much noise.&#160; So she was walking down the street &amp; saw our sign, out on  the sidewalk, &amp; came into Focus to get some things for him.&#160; I asked her  some questions &amp; she said that her sister&#160; thought about it all night long  &amp; then went&#160;to have the RU 486 abortion today.&#160; I asked if she had brought  her there &amp; she said "yes. I didn't want her to be alone".&#160; I said "you  shouldn't have brought her to Planned Parenthood, for that made you an  accomplice to this murder, &amp; you should have just let her go on her own if  she was determined to have her baby killed, even though it&#160;wasn't right".&#160; I  said "now you will be affected by this for the rest of your life".&#160; She looked  at her nephew &amp; said "I didn't want him to suffer".&#160; I said "oh he'll  suffer, for his brother or sister&#160;was killed at Planned Parenthood today".&#160; I  said for her to go back into Planned Parenthood &amp; to get her sister out of  there &amp; to bring her to us &amp; we'll get her to a doctor that will take  the deadly pills out of her .&#160; I said that we did this to one woman &amp; her  baby is 3 years old now so it can turn out okay.&#160; She said that she would try  &amp; off she went back to Planned Parenthood &amp; we never saw her again nor  her sister.&#160; It was either to late or her sister wanted to continue the process  of having her precious baby be killed.&#160; Only God knows.&#160; Martha's &amp; my heart  hurt real bad..... <br /></span></span></div></font></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"></span></span><font face="Arial"><p>&#160;</p><hr /></font></span></font></span></div></span></div></div></div></div></div></strong></span></div><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wednesday, September, 21, 2011 at  Focus</span></span></span></strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp;

He said that he was going to go to lunch now, for he is  with Sheila from 10:30am to 1pm, praying on the front lines.&#160; After lunch he  then comes back to Focus &amp; helps us&#160;out there.&#160; Suzanne, our Client  Advocate,&#160;wasn't going to be with us this afternoon, so I prayed even harder  that the Holy Spirit would direct our paths today, as always.&#160; I went on the  front lines to say hi to Sheila &amp;&#160; to get a review of the morning &amp;  early afternoon with her.&#160; She said that she gave 2 pregnancy tests today &amp;  thank God that they were both negative.&#160; She spoke with the mega phone to the  people going in &amp; out of Planned Parenthood offering them help.&#160; She also  spoke to the brother of one of the workers in Planned Parenthood, who works as  an receptionist.&#160; Sheila gave him some information about the founder of Planned  Parenthood, Margaret Sanger,&#160;who was a white racist who wanted the Black Race  done away with.&#160; Sheila gave him our muti informational DVD to show his sister.&#160;  Hopefully after she sees the DVD,&#160;she'll leave Planned Parenthood, in a hurry!!&#160;  I said 'good bye" to Sheila &amp; thanked her for her great job that she does.&#160;  I saw Bill across the street &amp; waved to him.&#160; He'll be 82 on Sunday.&#160; He  also said that he had to leave at 2pm promptly.&#160; Adolf will come at 2pm &amp;  he'll stay until 4pm.&#160; Carole was now with me on the front lines &amp; Martha  couldn't leave the center for she was so very busy.&#160; A couple of girls walked  passed us on the sidewalk &amp; the one girl even cried when she saw the graphic  signs &amp; they were heading to Focus.&#160; When I was called in to help Martha on  my cell phone when I was walking down the hall she say me &amp; said "you were  the one that was out there".&#160; I said "yes".&#160; I then was asked by Martha to  assist a mother of a two year old &amp; is 5 months pregnant to get housing  assistance.&#160; I called <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">RAIHN&#160;</span> (a not-profit, non-denominational group of faith  communities helping homeless families achieve sustainable  independence)&#160;@ </span></span></strong><font face="Arial"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-family: Times-Italic;"><a href="http://www.raihn.org/"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">http://www.raihn.org/</span></span></strong></span></a></span></font></font></div><div>&#160;</div><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<em>&amp;</em>  they said for her to call on Monday &amp;

 Martha had given&#160;two pregnancy tests &amp; filled out&#160;an Intake Sheet on our  client that was 5 months pregnant, so that we could&#160;follow -up on her progress.&#160;  After I helped this client I went back out to the front lines where Carole was  by herself for the time I was in Focus.&#160;</span></strong></div><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></strong></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Cars were in coming in &amp;

lots of tattoos, on her body,&#160;went by us &amp; she  spit twice, on the sidewalk,&#160;close to&#160;where I was standing.&#160; I said "is that  what you think of yourself", as she walked into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I&#160;said to  myself&#160;that if her spit got on me I'd call the Police right away, for people  have so many diseases now a days &amp; it's a crime to spit on anyone too.&#160;  About 2 hours later she finally came out.&#160; She said to me "you don't know why I  was in there, why don't you take care of the children that are already here".&#160; I  said to her as she was walking down the sidewalk "these children are already  here, you just can't see them".&#160; How sad a concept.&#160; Kill those who you cannot  see &amp; make them non persons, so that you can easily&#160;kill them.&#160; I hope &amp;  prays that she wakes up, for I told her that Planned Parenthood&#160;is making a fool  out&#160;of her.&#160;

her boyfriend drove into Planned Parenthood &amp; he was  smirking at Martha &amp; Carole, who were standing on the sidewalk praying &amp;  witnessing with signs, as they drove into the parking lot.&#160; They both got out of  the car &amp; he followed her into the building.&#160; It was less than 5 minutes  later they both walked out &amp; they got into the car &amp; as they were  leaving the boyfriend gave the #1 gesture to Carole, who was holding the sign,  which reads:&#160;<span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">What does abortion cost: One Human Life.</span></span>&#160;

Martha &amp; I were in &amp; out, on the front lines &amp; in  the center, all afternoon.&#160; I was happy to hear this, that's for  sure. </span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></strong></p><div><p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><font face="Tahoma">The man, I think  that his name is Tony, was at the vets today, across the street.&#160; He has a big  sign on his truck that states the Strong Hospital didn't care for his wife  properly &amp; she died.&#160; When he came out of the vets he waved over to me &amp;  I remember speaking with him months ago on the sidewalk.&#160; He is still grieving  that his wife was gone.&#160; It's his way of protesting Strong Hospital&#160;for their  actions, that he deemed inexcusable, &amp; is letting everyone know about.&#160; I  certainly have my own personal feelings about Strong Hospital, (for this was the  hospital that I was gang raped back in 1971) &amp; some social ones too (they do  second trimester abortions &amp; fetal experimentation's) there&#160;too.&#160; Planned  Parenthood refers all their victims there for a second trimester abortion by  Nancy Stanwood.&#160; They are hypocrites, for a hospital is suppose to save lives,  &amp; not take lives, through abortion.&#160; I heard that a woman who was pregnant  with triplets was referred to a multi birth expert &amp; he was doing a n  ultrasound on her when he said "one is yawning &amp; the other is sucking it's  thumb &amp; &amp; the other is sleeping, which one do want to terminate?&#160; "What,  none of them"!! &#160;she said &amp; out the door she went.&#160; Good woman, who was  insulted &amp; appalled by this&#160; doctors statement, by this so called killing  expert, at Strong Hospital.&#160;She shouldn't have&#160;had to go through this.&#160; I wonder  how many woman given in &amp;&#160;had one or two of their precious babies  terminated, which means killed, through this doctors advice.&#160;&#160;&#160;See what I  mean,&#160;if they do any good they sure do so much bad!!!&#160;</font></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><font face="Tahoma">One of our moms  came to the sidewalk &amp; said that she had some baby clothes to give the  center &amp; no one was answering the door.&#160; I said "just keep ringing the  doorbell &amp; someone will answer, we're so busy in the center today".&#160; She  nodded her head &amp; as she was walking away I called&#160;over to her saying "how  are&#160;your girls doing?&#160; She&#160;responded back &amp; said that they were doing well.&#160;  I smiled back at her as she turned the corner to go to Focus, once again.&#160; She  is a sweet girl&#160;&amp; I wish that I walked over to give her a hug for I remember  her well.&#160; But I had to turn around to call out to the people going into Planned  Parenthood, that were planning to have their precious baby be killed by Rachael  Phelps the "death doctor' today.&#160; How sad that so-called doctors are killing  their patients children.&#160; How messed up can&#160;they be?? &#160;Very messed  up................</font></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><font face="Tahoma">Carole &amp; Adolf  had to go &amp; Bill had left awhile ago so Martha &amp; I were out on the front  lines by ourselves.&#160; I noticed that a young girl was sitting on the bench in  front of Planned Parenthood talking to a young man.&#160; I started to address her  especially for this day is a surgical abortion day at Planned Parenthood as  Tuesday is a RU486 abortion pill day.&#160; As I was speaking to her, the  young&#160;man&#160;blocked her with his body, by standing right in front of her.&#160; I knew  that she had an abortion today &amp; was waiting for a ride to pick her up.&#160; I  noticed her, when he moved away from her for a few seconds,&#160;that she her face  was very sad looking &amp; she probably had been crying.&#160; I felt for her but I  really felt for&#160;her precious baby that was ripped apart &amp; thrown way in a  jar &amp; then put in the refrigerator, who won't have a life of his or her own  &amp; the generations that won't be because of her decision to go through with  the abortion today, even through there were people out in front offering her  help.&#160; I just don't get this Lord!!&#160;&#160;This is a very painful ministry, it's only  through the grace of God, that I come back to the front lines 3 times a week.&#160;  Just then a car had pulled into the parking lot it was a middle aged woman in  the car.&#160; The young man gave the girl a hug &amp; then walked up the street,  away from us, towards E. Main St..&#160; I saw that she was heading to the car when I  heard the I guess it was her mother or aunt say "then why did you go through  with it"!!!&#160; She sounded very upset.&#160; As the car drove out the young girl had  her head down so that she wouldn't see the graphic, but how did she know this  unless she had seen them going into Planned Parenthood first.&#160; As the car passed  by me I said, "I hope that you didn't have your baby killed if you did I hope  that you'll repent".&#160; I usually say this, for I think that I'm in denial &amp;  also I don't want to accuse any woman or girl of&#160;having an abortion, if they  didn't. Lord have mercy!</font></span></strong></p><div><p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium">Martha was still with me &amp; we had  seen a tall man in camouflage clothes go in &amp; out of Planned Parenthood many  times this afternoon &amp; at one point he walked up the sidewalk probably  because he didn't want to want in there.&#160; He finally came back &amp; I called  over to him saying "I hope that you didn't have you r baby killed here today"?&#160;  He was now walking over to where Martha &amp; I were standing on the sidewalk by  the tall bushes.&#160; He said "are you the one that runs the center down the  street"?&#160; I said "yes".&#160; Then he said "you'd think that you'd be a little more  nicer then".&#160; I said back to him "sir you're evading my question, for I asked  you if your baby is being aborted today, for I think that is the issue here,  don't you think"?&#160; He said that his girlfriend was in there for the birth  control Mirena, really an IUD, which always acts as an abortifacient, to destroy  the already fertilized egg, which is a human being, a male or a female.&#160;&#160;&#160;I told  him what the IUD does &amp; that it acts to destroy life in the womb.&#160; I handed  him a Truth packet &amp; a DVD, which he took.&#160; &#160;I spoke to him about abstinence  &amp; to respect her &amp; for her to respect him too.&#160; Just then another young  man, holding a little boy, came into the conversation.&#160; His girlfriend, he said,  was in there for the Mirena too.&#160; Both guys brought their girlfriends here today  to get the Mirena birth control inserted into their uteruses?&#160; So odd.&#160;&#160; This  'so called new birth control' which is really another type of IUD, can cause  early abortions &amp; has many side effects too.&#160; You play with fire you get  burned.&#160; Martha tried to talk to them both, to be the 'voice of reason'.&#160; The  second guy took a Truth packet too.&#160; The first&#160; guy said to me "I know that you  probably had sex before marriage".&#160; I said that I had waited to be married  first.&#160; I said this isn't about me but about you &amp; your girlfriend &amp;  about your souls.&#160; Just then I looked down the sidewalk &amp; I saw Memo walking  towards me.&#160; He said that he was coming today to pick up the information that he  needed to record, for our records.&#160;&#160;He comes to do our Data Entry&#160;for Focus,  about every six weeks, or so.&#160; I thought to myself,&#160;perfect timing Memo, thank  you Lord, for I think that these two guys&#160;would just go back &amp; forth, with  Martha &amp; I,&#160;until&#160;they were called back into Planned Parenthood by their  girlfriends.&#160; They both could be making up this story about the birth control  Mirena &amp; that they&#160;were really waiting for their girlfriends to recover from  their abortions.&#160; Only God knows for sure &amp; they will have to answer to Him  someday, for their actions.&#160; I then greeted Memo with a short hug &amp; we both  went into&#160;the center,&#160;for me to give him our Material Aid Sign In sheets &amp;  our spending receipts &amp; our donor's names &amp; addresses, for our records.&#160;  He takes them home to work on them there, by putting the information in the  Database, for Focus.&#160; This data will be used&#160;for our Federal 990 Form, for  2011.&#160;&#160;He has been with us for 2 years now.&#160; He's a blessing to us at Focus,  thank you Lord!!!&#160;</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was unfortunately left outside  still taking to these guys by herself&#160;&amp; when she came in a little later I  asked her how did&#160;it go after I left.&#160; She said that they went back to their  cars &amp; one of them started up the loud obscene music &amp; then she stopped  talking to them, at that point.&#160; She asked one of the taxi drivers to help her  bring the things in from the sidewalk &amp; he did help her &amp; was reward  later on by a few hard candies that he likes.&#160; No act of kindness is left un  rewarded.&#160;</span></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul was helping us out&#160;all afternoon  in the center by&#160;putting away the clothes, in the Material Aid Room&#160;&amp;

he said "sure".&#160; Now  we have a coat rack in the All Purpose Room for our winter coats.&#160; Thanks Tony  great job!&#160;&#160;&#160;We saw so many mothers &amp; their children today at the center, it  was crazy but rewarding.&#160;&#160;</span></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp;

I wasn't able to make Mass because of a couple of reasons.&#160; When I  arrived at the center Martha was just pulling from the Church.&#160; A man had just  pulled into  the parking lot &amp; cane over to my car &amp; asked if he could  help me bring the bags that I had in my car into the center.&#160; He &amp; his  fiancée are now raising 2 children of his sisters who is&#160;incarcerated in Pa. how  sad is that.&#160; Thank God for this couple who is taking responsibility for caring  for these two children.&#160; He was nice enough to help me bring things into the  center &amp; Martha took over in assisting this family.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp;  I went to the door &amp; saw a very pregnant mom &amp; her sister, she said.&#160; I  asked what we could do for them &amp; the pregnant mom said that she needed a  car seat &amp; a bassinet.&#160; I asked when she was due &amp; she said "tomorrow".&#160;  I asked "why did you wait until now to obtain these things".&#160; I was nice about  it but I felt&#160;a little frustrated for sure.&#160;We&#160;gave her a&#160;pac'n play &amp;&#160;I  called over to Kirsten, the director of the Place of Hope Pregnancy Center, on  Bay &amp; Goodman St..&#160; She said that she had one &amp; for&#160;her &amp; for them  to come on over for it.&#160; I gave the sister, who was the driver, the address.&#160;  The sister saw that we had a double stroller &amp; asked for it but I told her  that&#160;it was promised to&#160;someone else &amp; if she doesn't pick it&#160;up soon&#160;then I  will call&#160;her for here to pick it up.&#160; Off they went to the Place of Hope for  the car seat.&#160;&#160;Just then I received a phone call from Tim &amp; he asked if we  wanted lunch &amp; said "yes".&#160; He said "I'll&#160;get some chicken sandwiches for  you guys &amp; I'll be over in about 20 minutes for I need to look in the  Material Aid Room for Margaret Mary, his 4 year old daughter who just had open  heart surgery &amp; is doing very well but her scar is high &amp; she needs  clothes that will cover it.&#160; I said "come on over Tim".&#160; He came with 4 chicken  sandwiches &amp; Martha &amp; I ate one each &amp; we gave the two&#160;sandwiches to  the guys in the taxi company.&#160;

uncomfortable in the center so  Martha called the landlord to come on over to get the temperature back to  normal.&#160; He came by around 6pm &amp; fixed the problem but it was still warm in  the center.&#160; Earlier Martha had called her ex husband to come on over to replace  the ceiling titles &amp; he did.&#160; Thanks Frank.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang again &amp; it was Valerie.&#160;  Martha took care of her but I have a feeling that thing weren't good with her  &amp; her situation.&#160; I spotted her in the  Material Aid Room &amp; I gave her a big hug &amp; I told her to come on back  anytime &amp; that she always has us.&#160; She smiled.&#160; I went back to the All  Purpose Room to do some more work getting ready for tonight.&#160; The doorbell rang  &amp; it was Kathy, our new&#160; volunteer, at Focus.&#160; I orientated her briefly  &amp; then off&#160;she started to work putting away the clothes, with Carole's  help.&#160; I felt like I was a chicken with my head off this afternoon.&#160; I looked up  from the kitchenette &amp; saw two woman walking towards me.&#160; One woman looked  familiar.&#160; I said "hi" &amp; asked them what I could do for them.&#160; I spent the  next hour in the office making phone calls to help one the woman to get  furniture, clothes &amp; food for her situation.&#160; We also gave them food from  our food shelves.&#160; I tried to help them to the best of my ability.&#160; The one  woman said " I thank God that you're hear".&#160; I was happy to hear that.&#160;  After they left more clients came into Focus for  children's clothes &amp; some food.&#160; It made my heart feel good.&#160; It was now  4:30pm &amp; Kathy had to leave.&#160; I worked her hard &amp; she enjoyed it &amp;  will be back on Thursday from 1-4pm at the center.&#160; I saw Suzanne, later on at  the Kick Off Rally,&#160;&amp; I asked her to orientate&#160;Kathy to the office &amp; in  doing pregnancy tests, on Thursday, of this week.&#160; I also expressed to her that I wanted  Kathy to work on updating the Referral Sheet, by making phone calls &amp;  obtaining information that will assist our clients more efficiently.&#160;&#160;Suzanne said that she would.<br /></span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></strong></div></div><div><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><font><strong>The door bell rang &amp;

I was happy to see everyone.&#160;  Thank you Lord!&#160; It was 6:30pm now&#160;&amp; the people were coming in to attend the  Rally.&#160;&#160;They brought in desserts,&#160;there was a great selection, of all kinds.  Some brought in some non perishable foods, for our food shelves.&#160; How generous  they all were&#160;for the people that will be blessed by the food items.&#160; I was in  the office when Dr. Kate Lammers came in &amp; then I saw Fr. Brian in the hall  &amp; I asked if would hear my confession after his talk.&#160; He said how about  now.&#160; So we went into the Rose Room &amp; Father heard my confession.&#160; I felt  better.&#160; He came out &amp; headed to the Great Room where Rick introduced him.&#160;  He gave a wonderful talk &amp; it was a blessing to us all who heard him.&#160; After  the talk&#160;Father couldn't stay for desserts but we gave him a box of chocolates  as a thank you gift.&#160; He was so happy, for he said that he&#160;really enjoys  chocolate.&#160; We gave him a cake to take back to the rectory for the other priests  to enjoy.&#160; He said "thank you" &amp; we thanked him again for coming tonight.&#160;  What a blessing Fr. Brain is.&#160; Then Rick introduced Dr. Lammers as the next  speaker.&#160; She got up with her cane &amp; started to say that she was a little  nervous&#160;so she would like to start with a song for that relaxes her.&#160; Then she  sang a song invoking the Holy Spirit to come.&#160; She went on to give a terrific  talk that blessed us all, very knowledge &amp; informative, on many topics of  pro life.&#160; After her talk I presented her with one red rose, as a thank you,  for&#160;her presentation.&#160; Then Rick introduced the last&#160;speaker who was Carol  Crossed.&#160; She gave a wonderful talk &amp; was presented with one red rose as a  thank you too.&#160; Then Lee Strong sang &amp; after that we all received a candle  &amp; a prayer sheet &amp; walked over to Planned Parenthood to pray in the late  evening with the lighted candles.&#160; After that most of the people went home  &amp;&#160; Martha, Dan &amp; Rick helped me to clean up.&#160;

need to be put away now.&#160; I  was expecting the Elim Students tonight to be helping out tonight from 4 to  6:30pm.&#160; That was good that they are starting back up during the school semester  this year &amp; early next year too.&#160; What a blessing they have been for us at  Focus.&#160; I was anxious to meet the 3 new girls that were assigned to us.&#160; Martha  &amp; I were busy&#160; doing pregnancy tests &amp; assisting in the Material Aid  Room in helping out our mothers.&#160; It was now pass 4p &amp; no Elim students?&#160;  Then my cell phone rang &amp; it was Danielle, the leader, calling to tell me  that they got lost but were in the city, that they just couldn't kind where we  were located.&#160; I tried to give her directions &amp; then my cell was ringing  again so I had to go.&#160; It was about 20 minutes later they pulled into the  parking&#160; lot were we are located.&#160; We all took a deep breath &amp; I gave them a  "hello" &amp; a hug.&#160; We all went into the center &amp;I introduced them to  Martha &amp; we all sat down at the table &amp; introduced ourselves to each  other.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; it was Pat, our grandmother &amp; great  grandmother coming in for a visit &amp; to get some things for the children.&#160; I  introduced them to Pat &amp; we all talked for a few more minutes.&#160; I then  assigned the girls to their assignments.&#160; Danielle said that they needed to  change their times on Wednesdays&#160;to 2pm to 4:30pm, which was fine with me.&#160;It  works out better for Martha &amp;&#160;I &amp;&#160;it&#160;will give them a better chance to  meet our mothers &amp; to assist them in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I asked if any  of the girls were computer savvy but they said that they weren't so I was a  little disappointed in that but I didn't let them know.&#160; I was hoping to get  some office work done by someone that could use the computer.&#160; Oh well, I'm just  so grateful that they are here with us for many months.&#160; What a blessing!!&#160;  Thank you Lord!!&#160;

she  had to go.&#160; Always great seeing Pat, that's for sure.&#160; After Martha &amp; I ate together a delicious meal &amp; cleaned up  she went home &amp; I stayed to do some more work especially in the office.&#160;

She has  started her own ministry during her time, she's a one woman dynamo.&#160; I thank God  for her &amp; her team.&#160; I know that they have saved lives during their time.&#160;  Sheila had to go so I was there know with Carole &amp;

I called over to a woman who was driving into the parking lot  &amp; offered her some information.&#160; She said that she was going to pick up  someone &amp; she didn't know what she was here.&#160; I informed her that they do  abortions on Thursdays.&#160; She said that if she had an abortion then she will have  to answer to God for it.&#160; She said that she didn't believe in it.&#160; I said "we  don't either".&#160; She parked her car &amp; then walked over to where I was  standing.&#160; I offered her a Truth packet, DVD &amp; a CD to take with her.&#160; She  took the information.&#160; Then I saw that she was wearing a peace sign necklace  &amp; I just informed her that the peace symbol was an inverted cross.&#160; She took  offense &amp; gave me back all the information that I just gave her for her  niece.&#160; As she walked away I said to her that she was letting her stubbornness  &amp; pride get in the way of helping her niece especially if she was in Planned  Parenthood having an abortion.&#160; She went back to her&#160;car waiting for her niece  to come out.&#160; As they drove out I saw that her niece, who was in the front seat,  look at the graphic picture that I was holding &amp; I read her lips saying "  how horrible".&#160; I can't say for sure that she was there today for an abortion, I  sure hope not.&#160; There's not much that they do other than abortions on the  Abortion Thursdays.&#160; Only God knows for sure.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The neighbors from across the street never bothered  us today, which was good.&#160; We had enough grief just being in front of Planned  Parenthood.&#160; Just then a woman from across the street at the vets engaged us.&#160;  She asked if we were Christians which we replied that we were.&#160; She then said  "that we&#160;were dragging the Christians down".&#160; She was madder than a wet hen  &amp; as she drove off she had her coffee mug on the roof of her car.&#160; I don't  know when it fell off, of the roof&#160;of the car, onto the road.&#160; Poor baby, so  confused......I think Christians that are trying to save lives &amp; souls are  not giving Christianity a bad name but actually being Christians by the&#160;work  that&#160;we&#160;are&#160;doing&#160;for Him, that He expects us to do.&#160;

Scott Caton,  who is a newly ordained Priest and a  professor of history at Roberts Wesleyan College.&#160; He is a former Protestant  minister who converted to Catholicism 12 years ago and is a married father of  six.&#160; Martha &amp; I were very excited &amp; we had lots to do &amp; one was  that Martha had to make her famous Chili, for the Pot Luck supper, after the  testimony, which will occur after the Mass tonight.&#160; There was so much to do but  I expected the 3 students from Elim Bible Institute today from 2:30pm to 4:30pm  to help us get set up for the Mass tonight.&#160;It's what was happening to me before  Martha &amp; the girls &amp; Paul arrived that made my head spin.&#160; It was non  stop busy, in the Material Aid Room,&#160;from the time I got there at 12 noon until  2pm when the Elim students came.&#160; I got worried about Martha &amp; I was so  strung out that I called her at her home around 1:30pm to see if she was okay.&#160;  She answered the phone &amp; I told her that I was stressed out to the MAX.&#160; She  said that she was finishing up her Chili &amp; would&#160;she will&#160;be there ASAP.&#160;  Thank God that she was okay &amp; that she was on her way to the center to help  me out with all the clients &amp; situations that were occurring.&#160; I don't  remember this happening before like this.&#160; God is in control &amp; I'm only His  instrument,&#160;which I felt like a&#160;string instrument this afternoon.&#160; Only kidding  Lord!&#160; The minute I came into the center it was one mother after another with  their children.&#160; I also had to minister to the mom who is Adoption minded &amp;  had her call Compass Care to make an appointment for an ultrasound.&#160; She was  with her mother &amp; her son who was very inquisitive.&#160; I had connected her  with a family that is interested in adopting a baby, they have three girls of  their own.&#160;&#160;My friend will meet&#160;the mom&#160;&amp; have lunch with the&#160;her this  Friday.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that it works out for both parties.&#160;&#160;A total&#160;of five  mothers &amp; two children came in while I was alone in the center &amp; I was  suppose to be on the front lines today along with Martha for the '40 Days for  Life' campaign.&#160; I was so frustrated.&#160; I can't remember why I went to the front  door, but when I did I saw a young girl with a piece of white paper in her  hands, walking down the sidewalk.&#160; I opened the door &amp; called to her asking  her if she needed any help, for we were a pregnancy center.&#160; She said "no" but I  persisted &amp; I said that we also had many brochures for her to look at.&#160; She  walked over to me &amp; I let her into the center.&#160; I spoke to&#160;her for a minute  &amp; then asked if she needed any baby or children's clothes from the Material  Aid Room &amp; she said that she didn't, for she didn't have any children.&#160; I  asked if she had any family members that would be blessed with some baby items  &amp; she said that she did.&#160; She looked around &amp; took some things for her  family member.&#160; I know that it was the Holy Spirit that lead me to ask her to  follow me into the office which I never do.&#160; I was getting some information for  her when all of a sudden she said "that's my cousin".&#160; I said "what did you  say"?&#160; She said the picture that you have on the refrigerator is a picture of my  cousin Aaron Young, who was shot &amp; killed in front of his mother's house,  about a month ago.&#160; I nearly flipped, for Aaron young Sr., the father of Aaron  Young Jr., is married to Martha's daughter.&#160; I asked if she could stay until  Martha came, hoping &amp; praying that she was on her way over to the center.&#160;  She said that she needed to take a bus home that was to leave from downtown very  soon.&#160; I said to her if she waits, that we will have a taxi to take her home, or  even Martha might do it.&#160; She said "okay".&#160; I asked her if she knows who shot  &amp; killed Aaron &amp; she said that the police know but the family is waiting  to see what they will do about it.&#160; I was surprised to hear that he was shot  outside of the house because I thought that he was shot inside of&#160;his  mother's&#160;house, where there was a party going on.&#160; He was earlier on his&#160;bike  &amp; it ran out of gas so he went over&#160;to his mother's house &amp; called his  girlfriend to come on over.&#160; When she arrived later on the para medics were  wheeling Aaron on a stretcher into the ambulance where he later died.&#160; The  ambulance attendant told the family that Aaron was talking to someone just  before he died &amp; he thought that he was talking to God, just before he  passed.&#160; I think so too.&#160; Well Martha finally arrived &amp; I told her that this  young girl is the cousin of&#160; Aaron Young.&#160; Now she almost flipped.&#160; She spoke  with her for a long time &amp; found out that her mother had kicked her out of  the house &amp; that she was&#160;living with a cousin &amp; that&#160;she needs a job  too.&#160; Okay.&#160; Just then the Elim students came into the center, one of the  girls&#160;had&#160;a cold, no hug for her today.&#160; The two girls helped Paul, who also  just came into the center, to help us out setting up for the Mass tonight.&#160;One  of the students, Danielle, spent some time with this young girl, who needed a job  &amp; some prayer &amp; advice.&#160; After they talked for awhile Martha brought her  home.&#160; Thanks Martha.&#160; We hope &amp; pray the best for this young girl, who is  going through a rough time, right now. Lord please help her &amp; thank you!<br /></span></strong></div><p><strong> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Now things have settled down&#160;somewhat so everyone was helping with the  setting up for the Mass.&#160; The altar is being prepared &amp; the chairs &amp;  tables are being set up &amp; I'm in &amp; out of the office &amp; answering the  phone.&#160; Martha had put her Chili in the crock pot &amp; was warming it up for  supper later on tonight.&#160; I had taken the leftover desserts, from the Kick Off  Rally about a week ago, out of the freezer &amp; I also had bought a pumpkin  cheese cake for tonight (which was a big hit).&#160; People started to arrive early  &amp; we were almost ready, though when the people came in no one had a dish to  pass, so I started to get worried that there wasn't going to be enough food for  everyone, especially Father Caton,&#160;but I needed to trust in the Lord for He is  forever faithful, like the parable of the loaves &amp; fishes in the Bible.&#160;  Me&#160;of little faith, sorry dear Lord.&#160; The mother who was going to give her  powerful testimony about losing her son to Potters Syndrome was now there so I  introduced myself to her &amp; said that after Mass you will be introduced to  then give your testimony.&#160; She smiled at me &amp; said "thank you".&#160; Dotttie  brought in about a dozen of pro life cupcakes with little baby's feet in sugar  on top, pink &amp; blue.&#160; Just then the doorbell rang &amp; it was a young girl  wanting a pregnancy test so I asked Martha if she could assist her, which she  did,&#160; She was negative for her test but needed to see a doctor.&#160; So Martha  called Dr. Morehouse, on Arnett Blvd.&#160;to make an appointment for tomorrow which  she was happy about &amp; I hope that she kept the appointment with him.&#160; I  don't see why she wouldn't.&#160; Martha gave her some information &amp; she was  pleased that she received help here at Focus.&#160; We were glad that we could help  her.&#160; Sandy had come to help us earlier but wasn't feeling to good so she stayed  on the couch &amp; one thing lead to another in conversation&#160; I suggested that  she goes to the Sacrament of Confession.&#160; She said "yes'"so I asked Fr, Caton,  for he came early tonight to set up for the Mass, if he could here her  Confession which he said "yes".&#160; So I gently lead Sandy into the Great Room for  the Sacrament to cleanse her soul by confessing one's sins &amp; receiving God's  forgiveness.&#160; Wow, how awesome that !!&#160; She came back out of the Great Room,  about 10 minutes later, looking bright &amp; beautiful, such a transformation in  her face, then when she went into the room earlier.&#160; She said that she would  stay for Mass &amp; Martha &amp;&#160;I were glad to hear that.&#160;Pat, our grandmother  &amp; great grandmother had arrived with Amyeir, who is 10 months old now.&#160; He's  so cute.&#160; They sat down on the couch &amp; Martha &amp; I got to&#160;say a few words  to her before Mass started. &#160;Sheila came in &amp; it was so good to see her  &amp; have her there for the Mass too.&#160;Everything was ready except that I didn't  light the altar candles so Bill got up &amp; I knocked on the taxi door asking  Alex, the only smoker, if we could borrow his lighter.&#160; He handed his lighter to  Bill&#160;&amp; off he went to light the candles on the altar &amp; then he put the  lighter in his pocket.&#160; Sorry Alex you'll have to wait awhile for another  smoke.&#160; The Mass began.&#160; Like always there were 5 people that came in late &amp;  they settled into the Great Room for Mass, in honor of the Blessed Mother.&#160; Paul  was the altar server &amp; Janene, was the reader.&#160; The Mass was so beautiful  &amp; Fr. Caton gave us a wonderful homily, that blessed us all.&#160; After the Mass  Father introduced Janene to the people &amp; she begun her powerful testimony.&#160;  I was sorry that I was going to miss it but I needed to attend to the needs in  the Green Room with getting the beverages out &amp; putting the frozen casserole  into the microwave, etc..&#160; Joyce came out to set up her homemade humus dip &amp;  chip plate.&#160; I put the desserts out onto the table&#160;&amp; did some other things  by that time Janene was finished with her testimony about her newborn baby that  died in her arms &amp; the&#160;father &amp; their family all were able to hold the  baby &amp; to say "good bye" to&#160;him.&#160;&#160; He lived about 90 minutes after his birth  for he was born without kidneys.&#160;&#160;There wasn't a dry eye in the room not even  Fr. Caton, who has 6 children of his own.&#160; They were all headed now into the  Green Room to eat supper &amp; for conversation.&#160; I deeply regretted that I  didn't personally go over to Janene, to thank her for her testimony &amp; time  tonight, which was such a blessing to us all.&#160; It's tough to try to do so much  &amp; then the one thing that you should have done you didn't do!!&#160; I'm&#160;so very  sorry Janene &amp; God bless you &amp; your family.&#160; May your son Rest in Peace  in the arms of Jesus &amp; Mother Mary for all eternity.&#160; Amen.&#160; After Father  had eaten I asked to speak to him privately so I lead him into the Rose Room.&#160; I  told him of my traumatic past &amp; he said that he would keep me in his  prayers, which I was grateful to hear.&#160; hen Father gave me a blessing &amp; I  asked him if he would hear my confession which he did.&#160; I was so happy for his  blessings &amp; for his time.&#160; When he left the room he was looking for Joyce  who also wanted one on one time with Father.&#160; They both entered the Rose Room  for counseling &amp; prayer.&#160; I had asked Pat if she would like to go to  Confession but she wasn't ready yet.&#160; The Bible says 'now is the acceptable  time', but before you go to Confession you must be truly sorry for your sins  with the hope that you don't repeat them again.&#160; If she wasn't ready then it was  best for not to go&#160; but I hope &amp; pray that she will be ready real soon, for  I love her &amp; her soul.&#160; Please Mother Mary give Pat the grace to confess her  sins with an sincere heart &amp; for her to know that God does forgive &amp; if  we fall again we must get back up &amp; back to Confession again for it is an  ongoing process.&#160; I pray also Mother Mary that you will give Pat the grace to  forgive all those people who have hurt her &amp; her family.&#160; Thank you dear  Mother, in your Son's precious name.&#160; Amen.&#160;</strong></span></span><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font></p><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></font><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>People were all delighted in the ample food selections &amp; dessert table  too.&#160; Thank you Lord for coming though once again.&#160; I knocked on the door to the  taxi &amp; invited Alex &amp; Afendi to our meal.&#160; Bill handed Alex back hi  lighter &amp; thanked him for the use of it.&#160;&#160;I hurried into the office to write  Fr. Caton a thank you note &amp; then handed it to him &amp; thanked him for  such a wonderful evening of prayer &amp; reflection &amp; socializing.&#160; He was  delighted in the experience &amp; I hope that he will say&#160;"yes" next year when&#160;I  ask him to celebrate Mass at Focus once again.&#160; There were a total of 25  people&#160;that attended the Mass tonight which was wonderful!!&#160;&#160; Martha's Chili  was&#160;a big hit &amp; we all had enough to eat with leftovers too.&#160; Pat said that  she would go home to drop off the baby &amp; then come on back.&#160; I said "okay  we'll still be here".&#160; She came back about 15 minutes later &amp; Martha &amp; I  talked to her for a short time &amp; then gave some of the leftovers &amp; some  other assistance.&#160; She was very grateful.&#160;&#160;She left &amp; so&#160;did Martha.&#160; I  asked Paul to hang in there with me to put everything back tonight so that we  could start fresh tomorrow without having a mess to clean up then.&#160; He was nice  enough to stay with me until everything was back to normal.&#160; Thanks Paul, I  really did appreciate it.&#160; The center looked great to start another day tomorrow  with whatever God had in store for us then.&#160; Thank you Lord for such a  blessed&#160;evening in honoring your Blessed Mother Mary, who gives the honor &amp;  glory to you, her beloved son.&#160; Amen.&#160;</strong></span></span></div></div><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br /></span></span></strong></span></p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Thursday, October 6, 2011 in front of Planned  Parenthood </strong></span></span></span></p><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>This is Sheila account of the time that she's in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></span></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><font color="black" face="arial"><font color="black" face="arial"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bob, Pat, Bill, and Paul were on the sidewalk when I arrived.<br />
Many people were walking past us today, since the weather was beautiful and warm. Everyone I spoke to professed to be pro life.<br />
A young man took a packet to read, show to his girlfriend whose baby is due any day, and then pass along to their friends. <br />
Next came a lady going to PP for HIV testing because she is in a new  relationship. I urged her&#160; to never go to PP again. Why support a place  that is killing children? She took a packet, and on her way out I spoke  to her again about God. She believes in Him, and she does know He  doesn’t condone sex outside of marriage. Hopefully she will change her  lifestyle. She promised to consider our discussion, and pray the rosary.<br />
Bob spoke to a gentleman who was gathering scrap metal, and he accepted a rosary and said he would pray for our cause.<br />
A pro life couple was next. Her son is the result of her being raped.  Against pressure from friends, she let her son live. She asked for a&#160;  packet, and they will pray the rosary.<br />
Two youths on bikes professed to be atheists, and then backed down and  said they just don’t know if there is a God or not. They did, however,  agree that killing children by abortion was wrong. I told them that when  I was young I was agnostic for awhile. This is not uncommon. They did&#160;  agree to pray the rosary.&#160; I showed them the instructions in the rosary  packet. I hope they do pray. The rosary is a very powerful prayer, and I  know God will listen, and guide them. <br />
An older lady who already has a packet at home deplores the killing taking place at PP, and will pray that it stops.<br />
A woman was going to PP for a checkup. She has another doctor, but PP is  more convenient because it is near where she works. She took a packet,  and came to realize she was supporting an abortion facility. I hope she  doesn’t&#160; go there again.<br />
Another woman&#160; said “I’m against abortion”. I gave her a packet to look at and share with her friends.<br />
A young father came for material aid. He received a packet, and we  showed&#160; him how to say the rosary by praying a decade with him.<br />
Two mothers walking by with their children in strollers took packets and will pray for our success.<br />
While I was there, from 10:30 to1:00, Maryann came and went, Pat and  Bill left at 10, Paul was there for the day, Chris and Lucy prayed with  us, and spoke to Mary about&#160; volunteering on a regular basis, wherever  she needs them. Dan and Addison came at 12, and Adolph and Mary and  Carol at 1:00.There were several others as well, on the front lines. The  40 Days for Life Campaign has blessed us with a greater presence on the  front lines. <br /></font></font></font></span></strong></div><div>&#160;&#160;</div><hr /><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I arrived at the center to see many people praying,  in front of Planned Parenthood, that are always there on Thursdays.&#160; I beeped my horn to let Sheila know,  who is on the front lines form 10:30am to 1pm, that I was there now, for I am her relief.&#160; I couldn't find a  parking space so I had to go around the parking lot several times before I saw  that someone was leaving, to take his stop.&#160; I then went into the center to see  that Kathy, our new volunteer from the Church of the Holy Spirit, was already  there &amp; so was Paul but he had to go to lunch &amp; he said that he'd be back  &amp; then he'll stay until 3pm today, which I was very grateful to hear.&#160; Martha wasn't there yet &amp; I had a  feeling that she was going to come a little later today for we have been very  busy this week &amp; I know that she was tired.&#160; Carole was already on the front  lines &amp; she came to get some more signs to take back out on the sidewalk.&#160; As I  was helping some moms, that just came into the Material Aid Room, to get some  things for their children, Sheila came in &amp; brought with her Christopher  &amp; his friend Lucy, they were both  were interested in doing some volunteer work at  the center or to sidewalk counsel, on the front lines.&#160; I asked them some questions &amp; asked  for them to write their names, phone numbers &amp; email addresses down for  me.&#160; I can't wait until I receive an application form for volunteers from Teresa, the  director of Women's Care Center, so that we will have the proper papers for our new volunteers, to fill  out.&#160; They are a young couple &amp; we will be blessed by having them work at  Focus, thank you Lord for hearing &amp; answering my prayers for more  volunteers.&#160; I asked them if they could wait until Suzanne came so that she  could ordinate them to the center.&#160; Chris said that he had to leave but that was  okay because he won't be doing any pregnancy tests or counseling work.&#160; Lucy  said that she could stay until Suzanne comes &amp; I was happy about that.&#160;  Sheila said that she had to go, for it was getting late for her, &amp; then my cell phone rang.&#160; It was Dean, from  the Knights of Columbus, who is working on getting an ultrasound machine in a  Catholic Health Center, here in the city.&#160; The only thing is that the volunteer  who answers the phone refers people to Planned Parenthood or to Highland  Hospital for birth control &amp; abortions.&#160;&#160;This should never happen to say the  least, in a Catholic Health Center.&#160;&#160;Dean, was calling me at a very bad time, to tell me that he &amp; Jann, the Life  Issues Coordinator in the Diocese of Rochester, had met with Sr. Chris, who is the  director of this particular center&#160;yesterday &amp; they told her what we found  out in our undercover phone call, about 2 weeks ago, that Sheila made to the center who referred her to Planned Parenthood &amp; Threshold, for birth control &amp; to Highland Hospital, for an abortion &amp; she was  surprised.&#160; She said that she will look into the matter&#160;but this is not the  first time this has happened either.&#160; She needs to screen her staff &amp; volunteers better or we'll  take this portable ultrasound machine to St. Anne's&#160;Home to be used at their  facility where we will know that none of our girls would ever be referred to  Planned Parenthood or Threshold or to Highland's abortion clinic.&#160; Enough is enough.&#160; I had  to get off the phone &amp; Dean said that he will meet with me next week.&#160; I  said "okay &amp; thank you &amp; good bye".&#160; Off I went now to the front lines a  little late while Lucy &amp; Kathy were working putting away our donations.&#160;  Just as I was&#160;going out the door&#160;Suzanne came in &amp; I told her about Lucy  &amp; introduced her.&#160; She also said that her front door key still didn't work  so I had to solve that problem first before I actually got out on the front  lines where they're killing little precious babies, in Planned Parenthood.&#160; My  heart aches always when I'm out there &amp; many hours &amp; days afterwards  too.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Carole was there on the sidewalk where we usually  stand by the bushes &amp; Addison, Dan &amp; Adolf, were praying the Rosary  across the street, where it's a little quieter, for they don't have to hear me  holler especially when we don't have any mega phones today until the battery  inserts are delivered&#160;from Fed Ex on Monday. They were taken from our cabinet,  which is where were store the megaphones &amp; signs, in the Material Aid Room.&#160;  I had to order 2 more inserts for the 2 mega phones &amp; I hope that they come on Monday so that we can use the mega phones again on Tuesday, because at the end of  4 hours of constant hollering, to get the message across to the people driving  in for abortions &amp; other things, Martha &amp; my voice were shot. </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Carole &amp; I were standing on the sidewalk  holding our signs &amp; the people&#160;at Buckpitt, the business right next door to  Planned Parenthood, who dislikes us because the Buffer Zone, puts us pro lifers  right in front on their business, &amp; they still resent  us.&#160; They never tried to have Planned Parenthood removed from the neighborhood  only us pro lifers they still give a hard time to,&#160;who are trying to 'fight the  good fight'&#160;with prayer &amp; information, in trying to save lives, next door.&#160; How bizarre  is that!!&#160; Well, a truck came by Carole &amp; I, who were standing on the sidewalk, &amp; he drove so close to  us where we were standing, &amp; he went into Buckppitt's  parking lot &amp; he got out of his vehicle.&#160; She said "boy they drive so close to the sidewalk  where we stand, I think that they want to hit us".&#160; As the man got out of the  truck,&#160; I automatically shook my finger  at him saying, not loudly, "you should be ashamed of yourself trying to scare  women" or something like that.&#160; Well he was one of the owners who doesn't like us &amp; I think that he must have seen me do that,&#160;for about 10  minutes later, one of the workers came out to tell me that they were having  trouble seeing when they're leaving their parking lot to go onto the street.&#160; "Oh here  we go again, you ridiculous people"!&#160; I said to myself.&#160; It's been so many years now &amp; you still  don't know how to get out of a&#160;driveway, onto the street, without blaming us  that you can't see".&#160; What a joke this complaint was for I do take lives &amp;  safety very seriously, when it's merited, this was a 'pay back' for me waving my  finger at him &amp; I didn't even know it was the owner.&#160; Carole &amp; I were just upset when  his truck came so close to us on the sidewalk, that we felt thretened by it.&#160; I said to the woman from  Buckpitt, who I didn't recognize, that&#160;all you need to do is pull your car out&#160;a  little further &amp; then you can see better.&#160; Then I showed her a car that was legally parked right in front  of their building on the street &amp; in order for them to see pass the car  they have to pull out a little further to see on coming traffic.&#160; Don't they know this by now??&#160; Then I turned around, for I  didn't want to go back &amp; forth with this same old complaint, that's not valid &amp; I needed to get back to my sidewalk counseling  ministry, to try to save lives.&#160; So she said "I was told to talk to you &amp;  since you're not being cooperative then we'll call the police".&#160; I turned around  &amp; said "I'll be waiting right here for them when they arrive, to settle this hopefully, once in for all".&#160; Off she walks back into the Buckpitt building.&#160; I said to  Carole "lets just wait for the police to hear our side of the story".&#160; Just then  Kim, who believe it or not is married to one of the owners, who are brothers.&#160;  It's not the one that drives his vehicle up to the sidewalk where we stand,  which by the way I never mentioned to this woman when she said that she was  going to call the police on us, though I thought that I would mention it to the  police officer when he or she arrives.&#160; Anyway I called over to Kim &amp; asked  to speak to her &amp; I told her what had just happened.&#160; I then said to her  that if your husband or your brother-in-law have any complaints or concerns with  us I will talk to you only, for I can talk to you reasonably, not anyone  else at Buckpitt.&#160; She said that she would go in to see what was going on, which she did &amp; the police  never came.&#160; What a waste of precious time, out on the front lines, where they're  killing people.&#160; I did ask Martha, who just arrived, to go talk to the male pro  lifer who was legally parked in front of Buckpitt but was standing in the street  with his sign which probably bugged them too.&#160; He also had his music turned up  loud but he turned it down on his own or someone told him too, I really don't  know which.&#160; It's like I having to baby-sit out there at times when we're all adults &amp;  the reason that we're out there is to try to save lives.&#160; He was angry at first  but he did move from the street onto the sidewalk, in front of Buckpitt with his sign, but first he  tried to put it on his car but I had to call over to him that he had to take it  off for it was in the Injunction that it was considered to be protesting in the  street too.&#160; He did leave soon after all our requests but bottom line he was  there to peacefully protest, to pray &amp; to inform the public of what was  happening at Planned Parenthood, the problem was that he was right in front of Buckpitt in  doing it, which made them mad.&#160;&#160; Like I said earlier, they don't try to get Planned Parenthood out  of the neighborhood, it's just us they try to make miserable??&#160; How&#160; confusing is that after all these  years, 16 years next May, that we've been out there, on the front lines????&#160; Can't we just all get along......I guess not.<br /></span></span></strong></div><div><div><font>&#160;</font></div><div><font><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">All&#160;the prayer warriors had to leave &amp; Carole  had to leave too, &amp; Martha was in the center, so it was I alone,&#160;out there  on the front lines.&#160; The neighbor Jim, from the condo across the street, came  out &amp; looked at me probably noticing that I was loud enough&#160;without the mega  phone, for he didn't harass&#160;me &amp; he went back inside his condo across from a  Killing Mill, without a 'peep'.&#160; Yeah!&#160; For I didn't want to have to deal with  him today too along with Buckpitt earlier....one nasty neighbor was enough to  deal with,&#160;for one afternoon.&#160; I calling out information, to the&#160;guys who were  sitting on the bench, in front of the main door to Planned Parenthood, &amp;  they were waving at me.&#160; Can you imagine that they are waiting or even might  have paid for this baby to be murdered here today &amp; they're waving &amp;  mocking me.&#160; How sick &amp; evil is that??&#160;&#160; When the girl, who had the  abortion,&#160;got into the car with the two dead heads,&#160;as they were leaving the  parking lot, she gives me her middle finger &amp; the&#160;driver honked the  horn&#160;&amp; the two guys waved their hands out the window, at me.&#160; Their hell had  just begun, which saddens my heart.&#160; I couldn't reach them now but I hope &amp;  pray that the good Lord will send someone, into all of their lives soon,&#160;to turn  them around so that they can repent &amp; to ask God&#160;to forgive them, for what  they did here today to an innocent human being, by taking his or her life.&#160; Life  is cheap at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I hope that they make it into Heaven.&#160; Another  car pulled out with two young girls in it, the one&#160;girl who just had her baby  killed, &amp; the other girl who supported her &amp; drove her here, to have it  done.&#160; As the car was leaving the girl, who had the abortion, threw at me the  condoms, that were in the brown paper bag that Planned Parenthood gives you  after&#160;the abortion, so that you come back again &amp; do the same thing that you  did here&#160;today.&#160; Abortion #2.&#160; Most women &amp; girls come back again for a  repeat abortion, how sad :(</span></span></strong></font></div><div><font><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">All four packs of condoms, that she threw at  me,&#160;ended in the Buffer Zone so I had to wait for the right person to retrieve  them for me.&#160; I asked a guy on his bike, as he passed by me, if he was on our  side.&#160; He gave me a sign with his right hand&#160;&amp; I think that&#160;it was either  the sign&#160;for Satan or it was the sign for love.&#160; I'm not sure which one because  they are quite close in comparison.&#160; To make sure that it wasn't the evil sign I  asked the Lord to protect me from all curses &amp; if that was an evil sign, for  it to be sent to His feet right now &amp; for Him to cover me with his Precious  Blood, so it couldn't touch my soul, spirit&#160;or body.&#160; I asked the Lord to  forgive him &amp; I forgave him&#160;too, if he met me any harm.&#160; If it was a 'love  sign' then I asked the Lord to bless him.&#160; Not to many people really 'love' us  out there but one never knows, maybe he does.&#160; I then prayed for an angel &amp;  a few minutes another young man who was on his bike was coming up the sidewalk.&#160;  I asked him to stop, which he did, &amp; I asked him&#160;four things.&#160; One, was he a  Christian, which he said that he was.&#160; Second, I asked if he was pro life, which  he said that he was.&#160; Third, was he having sex, which he replied that he  wasn't.&#160; Forth, I asked him if he would go over there &amp; pick up the condoms  that were in the street &amp; on the sidewalk &amp; hand them to me.&#160; He did.&#160; I  told you that I prayed for an angel &amp; the good Lord sent me one.&#160; I thanked  him &amp; off he went.&#160; I didn't want to leave&#160;the condoms&#160;there for some young  kid to come by &amp; take them &amp; use them on his so called girlfriend&#160;&amp;  she gets pregnant &amp; they both get an STD.&#160; On the back of the condom it says  'that when using this properly it prevents pregnancy &amp; STD'S &amp; HIV'.&#160;  What a lie!&#160; You could hardly read it for it had a white background with light  gray printing on it&#160;so that you really couldn't read it.&#160; How sick &amp; evil it  that!!&#160;

the like.&#160; Kathy  wasn't there yet &amp; Paul wasn't at Mass so that meant that he wasn't going to  be here today to help us out.&#160; He comes when he can &amp; we are very grateful  for that.&#160;

I went back into the center &amp; Kathy came in, she  was late because she was saying "good bye" to her daughter who was going back to  college.&#160; I asked if she could bring some water for Martha &amp; she said that  she would &amp; that she would stay with her to pray.&#160; I said that was a good  idea.&#160; Carole wasn't there yet &amp; I asked Kathy when Carole comes could she  then come back into the center, for there&#160;was much to do.&#160; Se said "yes'.&#160; I  asked Chris to work on a project of an application form, for new volunteers, so  that they can fill out the paperwork when they are interested in volunteering at  Focus.&#160; The original paperwork came from Teresa, from the Women's Care Center,  &amp; I thank her so much for it.&#160; I have received many great ideas from her to  help us at Focus to be more productive.&#160; Networking is so great!&#160; &#160;</span></div></span></strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Chris scanned the information that I just received  from Teresa, by mail,&#160;&amp; he put our Logo on the top part of the application  form.&#160; He did a great job!!&#160; Then Kathy came into the center&#160;for Carole had just  arrived to be with Martha to pray &amp; to witness.&#160; I asked Kathy to give  Carole her favorite sign, out on the front lies, which she did.&#160; Kathy came back  into the center &amp; put clothes away &amp; diapers into bags &amp; she made  new labels for our clothing baskets too.&#160; Just then Allisaya came into the  center,&#160;for she had volunteered here, many months ago.&#160; She needed a letter of  recommendation for DSS (Department of Social Services).&#160; I went into the office  to write the letter.&#160; I hope that she will be ale to come back to help us out at  Focus, in the near future, for she is a good worker, no problems with her.&#160;</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></strong></div></span><strong> <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><strong>&#160;&#160;

the one girl wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I  said I will be right there.&#160; I got up from my desk &amp; greeted the two girls  who were seated in the Rose Room.&#160; I closed the door &amp; asked who wanted the  test.&#160; The one girl say "I do".&#160; I then asked her to fill out a Intake Sheet.&#160;  She said that they had gone to Planned Parenthood &amp; she was told that her  Medicaid card wasn't working &amp; that they charged $7.00 for the test.&#160; I  asked how they found us &amp; the one girl said that she saw our sign that was  on the sidewalk.&#160; I asked if they were friends &amp; they said that they were  sisters.&#160; The test was performed &amp; it was negative.&#160; So I talked to her  about abstinence&#160;&amp; gave her a Bible&#160;&amp; other literature &amp; a DVD of  'Starting Over'.&#160; Her younger sister already had a child who was 2 years old, so  after the test &amp; counseling&#160;I brought them into the Material Aid Room to  pick out some&#160;things for&#160;her toddler son.&#160; Then they left Focus &amp; I was told  by Martha later on that they went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; She knew that  because they had a bag of clothes that they received from Focus, that she  recognized.&#160;&#160;I don't know for what reason or for how long that they stayed at  Planned Parenthood.&#160; The one sister had the Depo shot at one time &amp; she  didn't like it at all &amp; I told her what it could do to her &amp; her baby if  she gets pregnant on it.&#160; She said that she wouldn't go back on it again.&#160; I  don't know why they would go back there after they told me that their&#160;Medicaid  card didn't work &amp; that she had a negative pregnancy test.&#160; Maybe they went  in there to tell them off??&#160;

so did Allisaya, she had a  chance to pick out some nice things in the Material Aid Room for her children,  before she left.&#160; It was Kathy &amp; I still working in the center.&#160; I had to do  paperwork &amp; make copies &amp; make phone calls etc..&#160;Then all of a sudden I  heard Martha talking loudly at the front door.&#160; I got up from my desk to see  what was going on.&#160; She told me that a young guy was harassing Carole &amp; her  on the front lines.&#160; He pretended to want to join Martha &amp; Carole &amp; then  all of a sudden he has in his hands a large piece of paper which read "these two  women are lesbians &amp; they just got married".&#160; She said that he said this to  every passing car that went by too.&#160; I went outside to meet this irritating  person &amp; there he was on our parking lot.&#160; I asked him to leave our parking  lot for he was on private property &amp; that if he didn't leave I'd call the  police &amp; they could assist him.&#160; I got on my cell phone &amp; pretended to  call 911.&#160; He didn't leave &amp; he was still being obnoxious.&#160; I then put the  phone back into my pocket &amp; went over to him on the sidewalk.&#160; Martha had  gone into the center to get the Blessed Salt &amp; was pouring it onto the  parking lot.&#160; He asked what was that &amp; I told him it was Blessed Salt, for  exorcism.&#160; He bend down &amp; put his finger onto the salt &amp; then put it  into his mouth &amp; said "oh it is salt".&#160; "Yes" I said but it has power  against evil, for it's not ordinary salt.&#160; He then said something nasty to  Martha &amp; I lit into him like a match &amp; I told him to watch his  disrespectful mouth.&#160;I then saw that&#160;Carole was leaving so I went over to her  &amp; gave her a hug good bye.&#160; I realized that he would now say that I was also  a lesbian but&#160;he didn't which was fine with me because I'm not. &#160;He said "well  you call names out there, you call them murderers".&#160; I answered back to him  "yes,&#160;because they are".&#160; He looked startled.&#160; Oh yea!&#160;for "you shall know the  Truth &amp; the Truth will set you free" from the Bible.&#160; He told Martha that he  wasn't baptized &amp; Martha told him that she could tell.&#160;We will pray for his  conversion hopefully someday very soon.&#160; He asked me what time we will&#160;still be  out there today.&#160; I told him until 7pm.&#160; Then he said "I'm going home to get  some chalk &amp; then I'll be back".&#160; Just then I saw a police car coming down  University Ave. so I flagged the police over.&#160; The police car pulled over to  where&#160;Martha &amp; I&#160;were standing &amp; I knew that Martha could talk to the  police woman, who just&#160;so happened to be the same police woman that Martha took  to arbitration about 7 weeks ago.&#160; How ironic is that!&#160; I walked down Gibbs St.  to try to catch the guy to take his picture on my cell phone but he was long  gone.&#160;&#160;I think that he&#160;'flew like the wind' when he saw that I was stopping the  police car.&#160;A guy at the corner restaurant asked what was going on &amp; I told  him briefly then I walked back to our parking lot to talk to the&#160;two police  officers who&#160;came in separate cars.&#160; I explained what was going on with this guy  &amp; they said that they would stick around for a little while &amp; that they  will come back often to see if he had come back.&#160; I said "thank you officers, I  really do appreciate it".&#160; They were faithful &amp; they parked at the vets  across the street for a good long time.&#160; This guy never came back again &amp; if  he did &amp;&#160;acted badly, then I would really call 911 the next time for sure,  no pretending.&#160; </span></div></span></strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div>&#160;

she  saw our signs &amp; she said to herself "is this what abortion looks like"?&#160;  Then she went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; She asked them inside if that's what the  baby looks like after an abortion &amp; they said "no" it's nothing like the  signs that they hold out there but she felt uneasy &amp; she came back out to  look at the signs again &amp;&#160; after that she went back home.

I brought out to the sidewalk the literature box &amp; the mega phone  &amp; I&#160;asked Kathy to bring out some signs for me.&#160; I asked her if she could  make me a sandwich &amp; to bring it out to me around 1:30 or so for I needed to  stay outside this afternoon, for Martha wasn't going to be here today.&#160; She said  that she would &amp; I said "thank you" &amp; then left to go outside. &#160; She did waht she said she'd do &amp; at 1:30 she brought me out a chicken sandwich &amp; my ice tea, which I was only able to eat half of the sandwich, due to all what was going on today.&#160; At least I didn't faint, thank God.&#160; I spoke with  Sheila, who was on the out on the front lines, for a few minutes before she had to go.&#160; She gave  me some very important information that we may be blessed with two new people, that she met this morning, out on the front  lines.&#160; They came to pray for the '40 Days for Life' campaign.&#160;&#160; Also, she told me that  Bill, who prays with Pat&#160;on Thursday mornings, in front of Planned  Parenthood,&#160;had a seizure on the sidewalk this morning &amp; Pat was with him  praying when this happened.&#160; He has&#160;suffered with these seizures since he was a  child &amp; is on medication.&#160; The seizures are not life threatening &amp; they last  for a few minutes, then he's back on track again.&#160; Sheila also told me that she  thinks that it was Eric, who works at Planned Parenthood, as a supervisor, that came out of his car to assist Bill &amp; offered him ginger ale.&#160; I  will thank Eric next week when I see him either driving or walking out of  Planned Parenthood for his charity in offering help to Bill &amp;

I, who were on the sidewalk &amp; she was heading to the center.&#160; I was happy to know  that she was now at Focus so if anyone needed anything&#160;like a pregnancy  test she'd was there to do it.&#160; The cars were coming in &amp; out of Planned  Parenthood but some of them stayed for the length of the time it takes to have  their baby killed &amp; to recoup, from the taking of the life of their very own  child, about 2 to 21/2 hours.&#160; I saw that there was&#160; a young man smoking &amp;  talking to on of the Death Escorts, the one was standing &amp; the other was  sitting by the front door, in a chair that she brought with her.&#160; I called over  to him that we could both the girl that he brought in &amp; gave him lots of  information.&#160; Just then I heard him say "what about the death penalty"?&#160; "What"  I said back in horror.&#160; What!&#160;&#160;"You're&#160;killing your precious son or daughter for  a crime he or she didn't commit".&#160;I said. &#160;I went on to say that abortion is a  death sentence of a innocent human being which so happens to be your flesh &amp;  blood &amp; deserves to live &amp; not be killed.&#160; Your child&#160;shouldn't  be&#160;murdered because you had an orgasm.&#160; You just wanted your pleasure &amp; not  the responsibility of this child that was conceived from you &amp; your  girlfriend having sex.&#160; Adoption if you can't or don't want to raise your child,  not abortion in ending your son or your daughter's life.&#160; He went back inside  the building.&#160; It wasn't long after that he &amp; his girlfriend came out &amp;  into the car &amp; as the car was coming out of the parking lot she opened up  her window &amp; threw something out the window at Carole &amp; I.&#160; I hollered  that you can be arrested for throwing things out the window&#160;at people but on the  other hand I was so happy that they were leaving &amp; I said to Carole that he  might have gone inside to get her out &amp; she was angry that he did,&#160;even  though she doesn't need his permission, to have his child killed.&#160; It's all the  'so called' rights of the mother &amp; not the father.&#160; I turned to Carole &amp;  asked her what she threw out the window &amp; she said "some loose change".&#160; I  was glad that it wasn't anything that could have hurt us, that's for sure.&#160; Lord  thank you for getting her &amp; him &amp; their baby away from this place of  death &amp; please continue to protect this precious baby in her womb if she was  here for an abortion &amp; may you continue to bless &amp;

broke her foot in a few places, last February.&#160; He was representing the  Liberty Construction Company who did the street &amp; sidewalk work this year.&#160;  I think they want to sue this company for negligence.&#160; It's so funny that  Buckpitt, who doesn't like us except for Kim, one of the owners wife, the nicer one. He told me that Buckpitt told him to talk to Mary for she saw what  happened.&#160; What!!&#160; I told him, as he was writingdown my words, that Martha &amp; I saw her  after she fell &amp; was down on the ground when we went over to help her.&#160; I  said that she fell on the ice for the sidewalk had been repaired for I had  called the city to complain that the sidewalk needed to have more cement on it  for it had spaces &amp; that people could get hurt, by getting their heels caught in the spaces, with  their shoes, &amp; break their leg or worse.&#160; I had put an orange  cone that I found, where the spaces where, on the sidewalk, to protect the  public.&#160; I think that it was about 2 weeks later that this company came to  repair the sidewalk.&#160; Just to long a time when people could get hurt.&#160; But the sidewalk  had been repaired at the&#160;time that this woman had fallen &amp; it was the ice on  the sidewalk that she slipped on.&#160; I asked him to come back next Tuesday to talk  to Martha for she was with me when this incident happened.&#160; He said that he  would &amp; then he asked me to sign the statement for his report.&#160; I said that  I trusted him to have written down just what I had said, for I didn't have time to  read the report, for I need to get to my sidewalk counseling ministry.&#160; He said  "thank you &amp; good bye".&#160; I said ' you're welcome &amp; I'll see you next  Tuesday".&#160; Off he went &amp; I started to counsel, to all the cars that were  driving in, to have their baby killed &amp;

I was by the fence, calling out to the girls going into  Planned Parenthood, when this incident happened.&#160; It happens all&#160;the time &amp;  this time was the 'straw that broke the camels back'&#160;.&#160; I then&#160;called over to  him &amp; asked him to be more careful when he goes into his driveway.&#160; He  started to walk over to us &amp; then he&#160;turned back &amp; as he was walking  into the building he hollered over to us to "keep out of the street".&#160; I said  "she wasn't in the street".&#160; Then he was gone into the building fuming, for he  has a temper &amp; needs to go to Anger Management classes.&#160; As one of&#160;his  customers,&#160;drove&#160;out&#160;in his company's truck, he took our picture on his cell  phone.&#160;

Bill" ( who is our  oldest pro lifer who sits&#160;across the street from Planned Parenthood witnessing  &amp; calling out to people,&#160;it so happens&#160;he's&#160;very near to&#160;this  man's&#160;condo)&#160;"you just woke me up &amp; I have to work tonight".&#160; Here we go  again I thought to myself, I need this like a hole in the head.&#160; He was getting  nasty * I saw that Bill who is 82 years old was telling him to stop it.&#160; I tried  not to pay any attention to him, for that's what he really wants, &amp; I needed  to concentrate my efforts at Planned Parenthood, not across the street dealing  with him.&#160; But I had enough for he was relentless in calling over to me being  annoying.&#160; I pretended to call the police to hopefully intimidate him to go back  inside his condo &amp; leave us alone, for we have a right to be there doing  what we're doing, but instead he said "Mary why don't you call the police, this  time,&#160;instead of just pretending".&#160;&#160;Oop's, then&#160;I've done this before then!&#160;  Okay, have&#160;it&#160;your way,&#160;so I called 911 &amp; asked for our pro life advocate,  Officer Chris,&#160;to come to settle this nonsense.&#160; We've been in front of Planned  Parenthood for almost&#160;16 years now &amp; he's been living across from Planned  Parenthood for the last 3 years, you'd think that he'd know, by now, what we do  on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays &amp; Thursdays, across the street from where  he lives.&#160;&#160;It's confusing for he told us that&#160;he&#160;was retired &amp; he was in the  war &amp; has a Ph.D., in something, is a Catholic &amp; is pro life too.&#160; I  wish that he could prove the last two.&#160; I know that we are noisy but we're  trying to save lives which none of the other neighbors are doing.&#160; Go Figure!!&#160;  Adolf, who stands across the street, in front of the neighbors condo, but just  prays &amp; doesn't call out to the people going in &amp; out of Planned  Parenthood,&#160;went over to him to talk to him until the police came.&#160; Well it was  about 10 minutes later &amp; a police car pulled up in front of us. &#160;I looked  who was in the car &amp; said "hello Officer Chris".&#160; "What's going on Mary", he  replied.&#160; Then he got out of&#160;his car &amp; I told him briefly what was happening  with the neighbor &amp; then he went across the street to talk to him.&#160;  Well,&#160;poor Jim&#160;got it all out of his system, for he chewed the ears off of  Officer Chris for at least 10 minutes or longer.&#160; A full 3 year report he gave  him, which doesn't mean a thing because we have a right to be there &amp; to do  what we're doing.&#160; Finally Officer Chris came back over to Carole &amp; I &amp;  the first thing that he said to me was "he really doesn't like you".&#160; "This I  know" I&#160; replied.&#160; I don't really&#160;think that he dislikes me that much but the  noise that I make, with the mega phone,&#160;when sidewalk counseling. He also  complained of how I sidewalk counsel &amp; that he didn't like my tactics.  &#160;Remember that he was in the war &amp; is probably suffering with Post Traumatic  Stress&#160;Syndrome, which I feel for him for so do&#160;too suffer from PTSS,&#160;from all  the past abuses &amp; crimes that we committed against me, in my life.&#160;So I  don't hate&#160;him in the least but really I feel sorry &amp; concerned for&#160;him  &amp; I pray for him often. &#160;Officer Chris told me that there is no law to video  tape us, for that is what the neighbor does every time he come out to harass us  pro lifers.&#160; I said "yes I know that".&#160; Then he said that he reminded him of  that it was our right to be there to pray &amp; to protest, even with a mega  phone. So it wasn't a waste of Officer Chris's time to help educate the neighbor  once again of our rights.&#160; Officer Chris said "I will ask you, for I said that I  would, but it's certainly up to you Mary, he's asking if you don't&#160;use the mega  phone on Thursdays".&#160;&#160;I looked into&#160;his eyes &amp; said with sincerity, "no I  can't do that because Planned Parenthood is killing babies on this day".&#160; He  said "okay, I understand,&#160;I just told him that'd I'd ask you &amp; I did".&#160; I  said "thanks&#160;Officer Chris &amp; by the way could you please talk to them at  Buckpitt, the business next door to Planned Parenthood, &amp; ask them not to  drive so close to the curb,&#160;where we're standing on the sidewalk, it's  dangerous".&#160; Just then he received a phone call &amp; after he hung up he said  that it was the Lieutenant &amp; that he had to go but he would talk to them  next week.&#160; I said "thank you &amp; you are in our prayers too".&#160; He said  "thanks &amp; gave me a smile &amp; he was gone.&#160; Thank you Lord for blessing us  with Officer Chris as our pro life advocate in times of trouble.&#160; I noticed that  he was looking out his living room window &amp; I then picked up the mega phone  (which isn't loud, for&#160;it's on # 3 volume,&#160;which is legal) &amp; used it&#160;for the  people at Planned Parenthood,&#160;so our neighbor would see that I will not  compromising the lives of these children who are going to be killed at Planned  Parenthood. I rest my case Jim or at least I thought.&#160; A few minutes later&#160;he  came back outside with his video camera &amp; started up again &amp; then went  back inside to get a pair of red ear muffs &amp; put them on his ears, as he was  using&#160;his video camera on us.&#160; Then I did talk to him saying "what are going to  say to the Lord when you die &amp; say that you didn't save on baby of His &amp;  you lived right across the street form an abortion clinic"?&#160; I don't know if he  hear me or not for just then he went back inside &amp; came out a few minutes  later &amp; drove off.&#160; The End for at least for today.&#160; He'll be back they  always do until he's converted.&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Now the good part.&#160; As Carole &amp; I were  witnessing on the sidewalk, while Officer Chris was over talking to the  neighbor, a car stopped on the street by the curb &amp; got out of his car &amp;  walked over to us.&#160; I noticed that he had a K Love ( a Christian radio station)  bumper sticker on his car so I knew that he was going to be a nice man, as he  approached us.&#160; He said "hi, do you take donations"?&#160; I looked at him  with&#160;puzzlement &amp; said "yes we do &amp; we have pregnancy center right next  to this yellow building too".&#160; I then turned around to get our new brochure for  Focus, from the literature box&#160;&amp; I handed it to him.&#160; He said "thank you so  much".&#160; He then went on to say that he was given the same&#160;Bible passage twice  &amp; that convicted him &amp; his wife to help those who are doing God's work,  at the grassroots.&#160; I said that we appreciated this donation very much.&#160; He  asked me how to make out the check, after he asked for a pen.&#160; I said "to the  Focus Pregnancy Help Center".&#160; He wrote the check out&#160;&amp; then handed it to  me.&#160; I didn't look at it then&#160;&amp; I thanked him &amp; his wife, for their  kindness,&#160;in our work for the Lord.&#160; He said "good bye" &amp; then walked back  over to his parked car on the street.&#160; Just at that time did I look at the check  to see that it was for $380.00.&#160; I almost flipped &amp; I&#160;called over to him,  for I saw that&#160;Officer Chris was walking back from talking to the neighbor,  asking if he was sure of this check that he just gave me.&#160; He replied "I'm sure"  &amp; he got into his car &amp; left.&#160; An angel was just sent down from heaven  to give us this check today.&#160; He didn't even know us or anything.&#160; Thank God for  our new brochure which tells about all our ministries that we offer.&#160; Thank you  Lord for this wonderful surprise for I had gone to the bank this morning before  I came to the front line &amp; made a deposit &amp; then I asked for our total  amount in our account&#160;&amp; saw that we were okay for the next months rent,  which I was grateful for,&#160;but I didn't have a lot of wiggle room to purchase  more literature for our Truth packets.&#160; Now everything has changed &amp; I can  now order more brochures that we're running out of, for the packets that we hand  out to the people.&#160; Thank you Lord for answering my prayer for more wiggle room  for the center.&#160;&#160;When Officer Chris had come back to our side of the street the  first thing that&#160;I said to him, before we started talking was, "guess what, the  man that just left just gave me a check for $380 for our pregnancy center"!&#160; He  said "great" &amp; he meant it too.&#160; Praise God, for such a nice &amp;  unexpected surprise, as we were being persecuted, by the neighbors today, on the front lines.&#160; Lord please  have Mercy on them all!&#160;</span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">But Jesus was  saying, “ Father, forgive them;

When the car came from behind the  bushes to pull out&#160;I saw that it was the president &amp; CEO of Planned  Parenthood, James Stewart.&#160; I said to him "you almost killed that man, see you  have the spirit of death with you".&#160;

She  doesn't know the Lord so how can she love him.&#160; As she was pulling out her mouth  was going a mile a minute &amp; thank God that I can't read lips for she was  very angry.&#160; I showed her the Crucifix that I was holding along with a graphic  picture of a baby that was killed by abortion.&#160;

She was concerned that I  would be alone for I hour.&#160; I said that I've been alone before&#160;&amp; that the  dear Lord is protecting me out here from danger &amp; harm.&#160; She reluctantly  left to go home to let her dog out which she loves but he&#160;takes some of her  freedom away.&#160; That's love for you!&#160;&#160; Just after she left Kathy came out to say  "good bye &amp; told me that the center looked great.&#160; I thanked her for all her  hard work in there today &amp; every day that she comes.&#160; She said 'thank you"  &amp; gave me a big smile &amp; left.&#160; A few minutes passed &amp; then I saw two  women who were walking up the sidewalk with a&#160;side by side double stroller, with  two small children in it.&#160; When they got closer to me the one woman said "hi".&#160;  I said "hi" back.&#160; Then I saw that one of the toddlers had a yellow Rosary  around his neck.&#160; I took it off of him &amp; told her that the Rosary wasn't to  be worn around the neck &amp; especially around the neck of a small child who  might be strangled by it. That it was a prayer &amp; should be prayed.&#160; She said  "okay".&#160; Then I asked if they were going to Focus &amp; the one woman said  "yes".&#160; I still saw Suzanne's car in our parking lot so I said just go right  over &amp; get some nice things.&#160; They said "okay" &amp; off they went.&#160; I  resumed my sidewalk counseling then about 10 minutes later my cell phone rang  &amp; it was Suzanne informing me that she had to go right away.&#160;&#160; I was trying  to think &amp; then she said "I have to go good bye &amp; hung up the phone".&#160;  This is the time that I really missed Martha just being the only one on the  front lines &amp; now I need to be in the center was just too much.&#160; I had to  act quickly for I didn't want them in the Material Aid Room alone for to long  &amp; I needed to bring everything into the center so that no one would steal  anything.&#160; I took as much as I could handle &amp; made my first trip to the  center &amp; made another trip &amp; another until everything was now in front  of the door or inside the door of the center.&#160; Suzanne waved good bye as I was  making these trips by myself but she had to go &amp; I am responsible to what  goes on in the center.&#160; I then saw that the two women were busy shopping for  their children.&#160; I talked to them for a few minutes &amp; then went into my  office to see what was going on in there.&#160;I would have to take care of the paper  work later on, certainly not now.&#160; I went back to the Material Aid Room &amp;  the two women were leaving.&#160; They had taken what they needed for their children  &amp; thanked me &amp; I said you are more than welcome &amp; come back when you  need to.&#160; They said "okay&#160;&amp; thank you".&#160; I then decided to go back to the  front lines again but just with the one sign &amp; the literature box &amp; the  mega phone.&#160; When I got back out on the sidewalk I was just in time to tell the  Death Escort, Sylvia Rose to repent for the thousandth time, as she was leaving  the parking lot to go home. I guess.&#160; Earlier when Officer Chris came, she  peeped (definition: to look quickly and  furtively at something, esp. through a narrow opening) her head, through  the bushes, to give me a grin, from hell.&#160; It made me quiver it was so evil  looking.&#160; Ick!!&#160; &#160;I later told her, as she was cleaning&#160;up the front of Planned  Parenthood of dead foliage that it was I who called the police &amp; not the  neighbor &amp; that she needed to clean up her own soul &amp; not to worry about  the clean up at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Earlier, I did call her a&#160; Sylvia Rose  a&#160;witch, when she was talking to the young man that was&#160;waiting for his baby to  be killed.&#160; I said to him that he was talking to a witch.&#160; He then went inside  but that doesn't matter for his baby was murdered in there today.&#160; How cold  &amp; evil is that.&#160; I do try not to call names &amp; have been criticized for  doing so but sometimes it's just the plan truth.&#160; I will not make a habit of it  though.&#160; I do want to represent Christ, to the people out there, on the front  lines.&#160;

 that God would forgive him &amp; He will give him the grace to go on &amp; to  lead&#160;a better life.&#160; He looked surprised&#160;&amp; then drove away.&#160; This message is  so foreign to people, the notion that they must ask God to forgive them for  their actions (sins), that offend Him, for He is a forgiving &amp;

I said "that's how they get you into their trap".&#160; I asked if called  Fidelis Care @ http://www.fideliscare.org/ . the information that I gave her  when she was at the center, &amp; she said that she didn't &amp; I&#160;asked her to  make the phone call as soon as possible.&#160; She said that she will.&#160; I told her  that Martha &amp; I are concerned about her.&#160; She can't get any help from  Department of Social Services because of her age &amp; that she has no children  &amp; her mother won't sign for her for there is problems between them.&#160; Poor  sweet girl.&#160; I told her to call us at Focus whenever she wants to talk &amp; she  said that she would.&#160;

I asked if he could just drive  further back as he&#160;enters his driveway &amp; I said that it feels like you're  talking off&#160;our legs.&#160; He hollered back "what did you say, what did you say".&#160;

she had made a face  &amp; then she said "when I went over to the car to talk to the girls I noticed  that there was a piece of paper, on the lap of the girl who was on the passenger  side, that said ' What you do after an abortion'.&#160; Poor Martha for she felt sick  to her stomach after seeing that &amp; then so did I.&#160; So were figured that this  was a 'Death Day' today plus on Thursdays too.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Two young girls were coming up the sidewalk &amp;

She gave me a puzzled looked &amp; kept on  walking.&#160; It looked like they were passing Planned Parenthood but they went into  the parking lot &amp; went into the door which was opened by no other that  Syliva Rose, the dedicated Death Escort, who loves her death job,  unfortunately.&#160; They came a few minutes later &amp; then sat on the bench for a  few minutes &amp; then left.&#160; As they were walking up the sidewalk they spoke to  a young girl &amp; a young guy as they passed by them.&#160;

 Off he went into the street.&#160; Creepy man!!&#160; Then a young girl was coming out of  the parking lot on&#160;her cell phone.&#160; I reminded her that it was against the law  to be on the phone while driving &amp; that she could cause an accident &amp;  even cause a death, maybe&#160; her own.&#160; I also told her that the ticket&#160;is  expensive &amp; it's like throwing money away.&#160; Be safe rather than  sorry.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I said to Martha that I was going to go across the  street to see if I could here her on the mega phone, for I was tired of the  complaints of the neighbor across the street.&#160; I crossed the street &amp; stood  in front of the neighbor's condo.&#160; I was assessing the situation when the  neighbor drove into his driveway.&#160; He immediately got out of his car &amp; came  up to me, of course.&#160; He said "Mary, what brings you to my side of the street"?&#160;  I said "I'm standing on my sidewalk &amp; I then paused &amp; continued &amp;  said "your sidewalk too".&#160; "Yes it is" he replied back.&#160; He&#160; then went on to  tell me that he doesn't object to me doing what I was doing but it was just to  noisy &amp; he didn't like my style of doing it.&#160;I said "what, are you judging  me"?&#160; I said that I wasn't here to please&#160;him but&#160;I was here to give the Truth  to the people that don't know it.&#160; He said that he has me on tape &amp; has  recorded many hours of my sidewalk counseling.&#160; I felt a little uneasy &amp;  then said "I hope that you enjoy the reruns".&#160; I said to him "you say that  you're Catholic, do you go to Spiritus Christi"?&#160; He answered back that he does  at times but that he goes all over even to Brockport.&#160; I said that Spiritus  Christi wasn't Catholic.&#160; Then I said to him "you're just mad because you bought  a condo right across from an abortion mill".&#160; "Oh now you're blaming me", he  responded back.&#160; I said "didn't you first check to see what Planned Parenthood  was all about first before you bought your condo"?&#160; He said back to me "I agree  with 90% of what they do in there".&#160; I was feeling sicker in my gut.&#160; I then  said to him "do you believe in contraceptives"?&#160; He answered back "yes".&#160; I then  said to him that he wasn't a Catholic then because contraceptives takes lives  &amp; ruin lives too".&#160; He disagreed.&#160; I said to him to go to Confession to  confess this sin.&#160; He said that he goes to Confession &amp; I said "do you  confess this sin"?&#160; He said that I was antiquated.&#160; What does that mean??&#160; I  believe in the True Teachings of the Catholic Church &amp; I don't make up&#160;my  own rules, like so many other so- called Catholics do.&#160; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Check out:&#160;http://www.ewtn.com/library/marriage/cclbc.txt</span>.&#160; I then mentioned about  hell.&#160; He said "I'll take my chances".&#160; What!!!&#160; I said "Why would you take a  chance of spending all eternity in hell"??&#160; I then walked away from him back on  over to my side of the sidewalk for this discussion was going no where.&#160; He went inside of his condo only to be  prompted to come back outside by one of the neighbors on the side street.&#160; What  a disaster that was.&#160; As he was waiting for Jim to join him in the school of  harassment I asked the neighbor for across the street with my mega phone "how  many children have you saved"?&#160; "None he replied "how many have you saved"?&#160; I  &amp; Carole hollered over to him "many".&#160; I said "what are you going to say to  the dear Lord when He asks you, after you die, for you do live so close to a  Killing Mill, of how many babies did you save"?&#160; &#160;I said "you &amp; the other  neighbors never came against Planned Parenthood from coming into your  neighborhood you all just let it happen &amp; know you complain that there is  pro lifers protesting this Killing Mill"&#160;&#160; How strange it that.&#160; &#160;I was then  talking to someone on the sidewalk as they passed me by &amp; then Carole said  to me "Mary he just called you a bitch to the neighbor with the dog who just  came up the street".&#160; I hollered over to him "how dare you call me such a name,  you don't respect women"&#160; I then heard him call me a 'she devil"&#160; He has the  wrong person.&#160; These men are so confused &amp; disrespectful towards women &amp;  I hope that they treat their mothers &amp; wives better then how they treat me.&#160;  Lord have Mercy on them!!&#160; &#160;As I was talking to the girls going into Planned  Parenthood or coming out they would holler to them "don't pay any attention to  her".&#160; I just gave them "a you're crazy sign, by twilling my finger over to the  right side of my head, sometimes words just don't work, maybe they'll understand  this better.&#160; I don't really want&#160;to&#160;go down&#160;to their level &amp; I want to stay  a Christian&#160;in a Christian matter.&#160; Lord please forgive me.&#160; Off they went, all  three of them over to the neighbors house with the dog, to continue there talk  about me.&#160;

requests  &amp; phone numbers on the new white board that Tim put on the wall, in the  office.&#160; This new white board Kathy gave us, as a donation to the center.&#160; What  a difference it makes, for it's larger than the other white board &amp;

great grandmother, of a total of 8 children.&#160; She was coming in for some  brand new children's clothes for her great grandchildren, that we just received  from the Church of the Holy Spirit.&#160;&#160; I told her a few days ago that we going to  be getting in&#160;some new clothes &amp; for her to come in to get what she needed  for her family &amp; the rest we were going to save for our clients for  Christmas time.&#160; She was so happy &amp; just took what she needed.&#160; We asked if  she would like supper with us &amp; she said "yes".&#160; So Martha set her up a  plate &amp; we had chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, a mixture of white egg plant  &amp; yellow squash &amp; a mean tossed salad with lots of good things in it.&#160;  She was happy to be blessed this way.&#160; We all got to spend time together &amp;  to talk.&#160; It was getting late &amp; she had to go.&#160; We said "good bye" to her  &amp; offered her some cake to take with her but she said "no thank you".&#160;  Martha &amp; I cleaned up &amp; then she left.&#160; I'm always the last one to  leave, but that's okay, for I have lots to do in the office.&#160;

When I arrived to the  center there was a gentleman, from the carpet company, to fix the carpets at the  entrance of each room that was starting to fray.&#160;I said "hi" to him &amp; then  said&#160; "I thought that&#160;you were coming around 3pm, for that's what I was told,  but that's okay I'm&#160;glad that you're here now".&#160; He smiled &amp; I brought him  into the center &amp; showed him what the problem was.&#160; Martha &amp; I were busy  putting things away, so we were everywhere.&#160; The gentleman was&#160;at the center for  a short time &amp; when he left, after fixing the carpet, he&#160;said "keep up the  good work that you're doing here".&#160; I said "thank you &amp; we will".&#160; He then  said that the carpet had a year warranty &amp; if we had anymore problems just  call us back.&#160; I said "thank you for this information &amp; good bye &amp; have  a great day".&#160; Off&#160; he went &amp; a few minutes later the door&#160; bell rang &amp;  it was Lucy, she's our newest volunteer, &amp; she came to help us at the  center.&#160; I went to get my blue stand up bag, that I have everything in, that I  had put behind my desk after Mass this afternoon.&#160; I was going to give her a  project to do for me in the office.&#160; When I got to the bag I thought that I  would now make the copies of the 6 checks that I had received yesterday at the  Post Office &amp; brought in today to&#160;make copies &amp; then Martha &amp; I  would write out the Thank You letters for their generosity.&#160;&#160;The total&#160;of the  checks was a little over $1,000.&#160; I had put the envelop on top of all the papers  that were in the bag, so when I&#160;looked in the bag &amp; didn't see it I  panicked, to say the least.&#160; The feeling was horrible.&#160; I asked Lucy if she  would help me to find the envelop &amp;&#160;I dumped the contents of the bag onto  the floor&#160;but it wasn't there.&#160;

I didn't know what to do now, so we  looked again, it just wasn't&#160;in the bag &amp; I knew that I didn't take it out  of the bag.&#160; I unfortunately called the carpet place &amp; asked the man  who&#160;answered the phone, who was one of the owners, that we had some checks  missing &amp; I don't what to do, for this is&#160;a very difficult phone call.&#160; He  said that no one would put his job in jeopardy for some checks that he couldn't  cash.&#160; I said okay thank you &amp; hung up.&#160; I felt badly making that call.&#160; I  told Martha &amp; Lucy&#160;that I was going to go back home &amp; look in the closet  to see if it dropped in there, though I didn't think that it did but I had no  more options.&#160; I asked Martha to keep the Three Elim Students busy while I go  back to my place to look &amp; she said that she would.&#160; The girls come&#160;from  2:30pm till 4:30pm.&#160; I said good bye to both Martha &amp; Lucy &amp; off I went  back to&#160;home to look, feeling sick to my stomach.&#160; I prayed in the Holy Spirit  all the way home.&#160;&#160;When I got there&#160;I quickly went up the stairs &amp; opened up  the&#160;front door.&#160; I immediately went over to the closet &amp; took everything  out.&#160; It wasn't there!!!&#160; I then went to the trash can &amp; opened that up  &amp; took everything out &amp; it wasn't there!!&#160; I felt sicker to my stomach.&#160;  I then called&#160;the bank, where I have our pregnancy center's account, &amp; asked  Heather, who I know from the bank if anyone could cash the checks &amp; she said  "no" but they could use the bank account number at the bottom of the check.&#160;  Well, hearing this didn't make me&#160;feel&#160; sicker, if that was possible.&#160; Then she  said that you should call the people up &amp; put a 'stop payment on the  checks.&#160; I said "no" that would work &amp; then the phone went dead.&#160; I&#160;though  that she hung up because I'm going on &amp; on with this &amp; that she had to  go but I do know&#160;her &amp; she is a professional who works at the bank &amp; she  would always say "good bye"&#160;&#160;to her clients first before hanging up.&#160; I was to  stressed out to call back again to find out what happened.&#160;&#160;(When I went to the  bank the next day I asked her if she had hung up on me &amp; she said "no,  the&#160;bank has a problem with the phone lines &amp; will be getting them replaced  real soon".&#160;&#160; I felt better after speaking with her.&#160; All is well there)&#160; After  that call&#160;my cell phone rang &amp; it was Martha I was so hoping that she had  found the checks but she called to say to me "why don't you put a stop payment  on the checks".&#160; "Martha I can't &amp; I have to go so please keep on praying"  &amp;&#160; I said "good bye" &amp; hung up.&#160; Then I looked the number to the carpet  store on the Internet &amp; called them back but this time with more panic &amp;  stress.&#160; I asked the owner to now call the person who came to fix the carpet if  he took it to just give it back with no questions asked".&#160;I also said if I do  find the checks that I would call back to apologize for my acussion. He did call  the man said that he didn't.&#160; I said "okay &amp; thanks &amp; good bye" &amp;  hung up.&#160; I walked around the apartment for a few minutes &amp; I heard a soft  voice to go to the trunk to look again.&#160; I didn't want to argue with the Lord  &amp; I grabbed my keys &amp; went downstairs to open up the trunk, which I  looked inside earlier when I was at the center.&#160; I hesitantly looked in my  purse, which I did before &amp; it wasn't there &amp; just then my eye caught  our brochure that was in the see through bag that I carry to church with me  which has rosaries &amp; prayer books &amp; the like.&#160; I quickly opened up that  bag that earlier I didn't see &amp; there the envelop was with all the checks in  it.&#160; I screamed at the top of my voice on the street.&#160; "Thank you Lord &amp; St.  Anthony for finding this envelop.&#160; I remembered what I promised the Lord when I  found it was that I would NEVER bring any checks that I get from the Post Office  to the center to make copies of , that I will let the bank do that on Thursdays  which is my banking day now.&#160; I quickly went back to my apartment &amp; called  Martha &amp; she was so happy &amp; Lucy was to.&#160; I said that I was coming on  back tot the center after I make one more call.&#160; I called the carpet store &amp;  apologized &amp; asked the name &amp; phone number of the man that I accused.&#160;  They gave it to me &amp; I thanked him &amp; said "good bye" &amp; hung up.&#160; I  quickly called Rick up &amp; started crying with my sorrow for what I did to  him.&#160; I asked him to please forgive me for what I did to him &amp; to please not  to hold it against me.&#160; He sweetly said "I do forgive you &amp; don't worry I  won't hold it against you &amp; no problem".&#160; I was still crying &amp; I said  "thank you so very much &amp; God bless you &amp; have a nice day &amp; good  bye".&#160; I was still sobbing when I got into my car heading back to Focus with the  checks safe on top of my desk in my home office.&#160; What happened was, before I  left for Mass I remembered that at the back of the church there were no more  Focus brochures so I went to my purse &amp; took out out 4 of them &amp; put it  on top of the envelop in the blue bag, which I forgot that I did, for I do  things so fast that it doesn't register in my brain.&#160; When I went to church this  afternoon I grabbed&#160;them to put in my clear plastic bag which I bring to Mass  which holds my rosaries that I pass out to people &amp; my prayer books.&#160;&#160;After  Mass I scooped up three of them * put them on the table&#160;at the entrance &amp;  exit of the&#160;church.&#160; What I didn't know was&#160;that I&#160; grabbed the 3 brochures  leaving one on top of the envelop in the clear plastic bag.&#160; How unthinkable on  my part!!&#160; Thank you again dear Lord &amp; Mother Mary &amp; St. Anthony for  finding the envelop with all the checks in it &amp; teaching me a valuable  lesson too.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I</strong></span><strong> <span style="font-size: medium;">was so happy to see Martha, Lucy &amp; now the  three Elim students, Danielle, Bee, &amp; Amy, we all grouped hugged.&#160; I then  talked to Martha, Danielle &amp; Lucy for another 20 minutes &amp; Lucy had to  go.&#160; I thanked her for all that she did for me today &amp; that I will see her  again next week.&#160; I got busy doing what I needed to do in the center &amp; at  4:30pm the Elim girls had to go.&#160; I thanked them &amp; said that I will see them  again next week &amp; thanked them for their prayers too.&#160; I gave each of them a  hug &amp; said good bye to them &amp; waved to them as they were getting into  the car&#160;saying for them to have a safe drive back to school.&#160;I had to make a  phone call on my cell phone &amp; the message was, which I para phrased 'put&#160;some  $ on the phone for you have no more minutes left'.&#160; What!!!&#160; Hear we go again,  this day is not without it's problems.&#160; I called the cell phone company &amp;  told her that I just spent $34.00 about a week ago which put on 1500 worth of  minutes &amp; I didn't call that many people in a weeks time so please look into  this problem.&#160; She did &amp; all was right with T mobile now.&#160; I just want this  day to end &amp; hope that tomorrow will be better but I knew that it wasn't  going to be because it was Thursday &amp; it's the day that they murder little  babies in their mother's womb's, without mercy. So I knew that it was going to  be a painful day, without question. &#160;Martha &amp; I worked at the center, she  taking care of clients &amp; I doing paper work in the office.&#160; We ate supper  together &amp; then&#160;went home.&#160; </span></strong></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Thursday,&#160; October 20, 2011 in front of Planned  Parenthood</strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I received a phone call from a woman asking for a  pregnancy test.&#160; I looked at the clock to see that it was 10:20am &amp; I knew  that Sheila would be there at 10:30 so I told her that a counselor would be  there at 10:30am to administer one.&#160; I described what Sheila looked like &amp;  just then the woman said "I think she just got out of her car".&#160; I said "great  &amp; have a nice day, good bye" &amp; hung up.&#160;I was so happy that it worked  out so well.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160;&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I arrived at the center&#160;a little&#160;before 1pm, just  after I went to the bank to deposit all the checks, from&#160; yesterday.&#160; I asked  the bank teller to make me copies of the checks then I black out the account  number on the bottom of the check.&#160; I use these copies, of the checks, to write  out the Thank You letters.&#160; As I was driving into the parking lot I beeped to  Sheila, out on the front lines, to let her know that I was here.&#160; I was hoping  that Martha wasn't going to be to late today, for I'm so stressed out on  Thursdays &amp; now on Tuesdays, for we think that they are doing abortions, on  that day too.&#160; I saw that one of our regular clients was in the center &amp; I  figured that the taxi man let her in but later found out that it was Sheila.&#160;  Which is okay for I need to start to trust people &amp; Donna has been with us  for several years now.&#160; I don't want to be paranoid for all the other things  that people have done to us by stealing.&#160; She had made coffee &amp; said that  she could help&#160;us for a little while before she had to go.&#160; I said that would be  great.&#160; Just then the doorbell rang &amp; it was Kathy, our volunteer &amp; I  let her in.&#160; I had gotten more donations for her to put away &amp; to sort some  of the clothes in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Just then Paul came in, which was  great for we haven't seen him in awhile.&#160; He was also hear to help us out.&#160;  Great!!&#160; I knew that Carole wasn't going to be on the front lines today for she  had to work so it would be Martha, Adolf, Bill &amp; I for a couple of hours to  defend life.&#160; I asked Paul&#160;to help me bring the literature box, signs, stools  &amp; now the orange small cones, about 10 of them,&#160;that we put out on the edge  of the sidewalk near the street so that the cars won't come by us to closely  &amp; hit us as we protest out on the front lines.&#160;It does make a statement  &amp; because they're orange people will look at them &amp; see our signs that  we have out there on the sidewalk. &#160;He did &amp; I was&#160;appreciative of it.&#160;  Sheila talked to me for a few minutes, to inform me of what went on,&#160;during her  time.&#160; She told me how the pregnancy test went &amp; more about the client &amp;  then told me of what went on the front lines too. &#160;Then she had to go.&#160; I said  "thank you Sheila &amp; thank you so very much &amp; have&#160;a great day too".&#160;&#160;  There was Dan &amp; Addison praying the Rosary so I was happy to have them for  about a half an hour more on the sidewalk.&#160; Then Adolf came &amp; Bill was  already on the sidewalk across the street witnessing with the graphic sign  Malachi who was torn to pieces at 20 weeks, in utero.&#160; Thanks mom for killing me!&#160; I wonder what her life is like now &amp; all the other women, that have  had their precious baby killed, in such a gruesome way.

I was so  glad to see her &amp; then about 10 later Suzanne came to be in the center so I  was happy about that too.&#160; I had asked Kathy if she would make me a sandwich  &amp; to bring it out about 1:30 or so but today it was about 2pm because she  was helping out one of our regular clients in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Which was  fine with me.&#160; Our clients come first.&#160; I wish that I didn't need to eat out on  the front lines but as I said before I start to feel very faint around that time  &amp; I don't want to so I eat a fast sandwich instead.&#160; I try to be discreet  about it.&#160; I go in the corner near the fence by the bushes &amp; I will have  another sidewalk counselor there, to speak out to the people going into Planned  Parenthood,&#160;before I start my sandwich.&#160; Martha took over while I ate quickly.&#160;  It wasn't busy at all &amp; it was 2pm &amp; I said to her "it's quiet before  the storm", which happened about 15 minutes later.&#160; Rachael Phelps wasn't there  because her car wasn't parked where it's usually parked, so I knew that there  was another abortionist, talking her place over these last three weeks.&#160; Now one  car after another pulled into the death parking lot.&#160; Mostly couples.&#160; As one  car pulled in the male driver smiled at me.&#160; I remember when he left with his  girlfriend that just killed his baby&#160;he wasn't smiling.&#160; That's what abortion  does, it makes you a father &amp; mother of a dead baby, that YOU had killed.&#160;  Paid murder!!!&#160; His &amp; her life &amp; all of them, that come here to have  their baby killed, will never be the same again &amp;

when some of the  guys started to realize what they were doing, it was to late.&#160; One guy walked  passed me &amp; I spoke to him &amp; he said things that I can't repeat here.&#160;  But when he was driving his girlfriend out as she was screaming at me, who was  standing there holding a graphic sign, he looked like the spunk that  he&#160;had&#160;earlier, was gone.&#160; I was in the center talking with Suzanne when he  walked back into Planned Parenthood&#160; Martha said &amp;&#160;that she didn't say  anything to&#160;him, for I had told her&#160;what he said to me earlier.&#160; She said that  as he walked by he looked at the signs.&#160; But it was to late at that time.&#160; How  sad.&#160; Another car came out &amp; the two young people were so cold &amp; callus  about just murdering their own flesh &amp; blood.&#160; They came back about 5  minutes later &amp; as they were&#160;driving back into the parking lot I said to  them"did you forget something, your baby"?&#160; But they didn't care, they had come  back because they had forgotten something &amp; it wasn't their baby, for they  wanted their baby dead.&#160; I said to the guys who were smoking &amp; waiting for  their 'problem to go away', "do you always kill people that are inconveniencing  you"?&#160; "If people get in your way that you don't want to be there do you have  them killed"?&#160; "Then what is the difference of what you're doing here today"?&#160;  "You're killing you own child because he or she is inconveniencing you in your  life".&#160; "How selfish &amp; self centered is that plus you're jeopardizing your  soul &amp; could dam it to Hell for all Eternity, if you don't repent for the  sin of murder".&#160; Just then a young girl was being driven out by, I suppose her  mother.&#160; I told the mother that she was an accessory to murder &amp; to repent  for it.&#160;The girl had a far away look on her face. &#160;Anyone who helps a woman or  young girl to have an abortion is an accessory to murder &amp; must repent.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Later on around 5pm, Pat came to join me,&#160;for  the&#160;'40 Days for Life' campaign &amp;

great  grandmother Pat, yes there are two Pat's, came to get some money that was given  to me to give to her.&#160; Martha &amp; I visited with Pat for about an hour.&#160; We  all even ate together, we had a chicken &amp;

I had to  stay in the center.&#160; Martha drove to Victor to get the Fatima stature from her  fiends &amp; we will be blessed at Focus, for two weeks with the stature, of the  Blessed Mother.&#160; We had many clients come in today.&#160; Martha had a hairdressing  appointment so she was going to come a little&#160;later today, so after Mass I went  directly to the center, after saying "hi" to my friends&#160;first.&#160; I saw that two  young girls were&#160;walking into Planned Parenthood so I walked up the sidewalk to  talk to them but I was to late, for they already went in, but there was a man  that was standing there praying from the "40 Days for Life campaign.&#160; I  introduced myself to him &amp; he said that we had meet before.&#160; Sorry about  that.&#160; He was so nice &amp; he said that another prayer person was on the other  side of the building by the brick.&#160; She was hard to spot for she was on her  knees &amp; praying.&#160; I told him that I had to go back to the center for one of  our regular clients was asking me if we were open now &amp; it was 12:45pm.&#160; I  told her that we open up usually around 1pm but I would open up the Material Aid  Room for her.&#160; Thank God that Kathy came soon afterwards, for I was busy talking  things out of my car &amp; bringing&#160;everything into the center.&#160; I got her  settled in&#160;the room where she could get things for 'free'.&#160; I then went back  outside &amp; saw that the man who was from the '40 Days for Life' was giving a  Truth packet, to one of the girls that I saw about 10 minutes before, going into  Planned Parenthood.&#160; I called over to them from across the street &amp; asked  them if they needed a 'free' pregnancy test that we could help them at Focus or  if they needed any 'free' baby or children clothes.&#160;They shook their heads "no"  &amp; then I went back into the center to see how our client was doing.&#160; She was  doing fine &amp; Kathy was there helping her pick out clothes for her children,&#160;  I was grateful.&#160; After she left many other clients came in. There were two  pregnant moms who needed something's for their babies..&#160; One of the moms is due  December 22 &amp; we gave her a car seat.&#160; She was happy about that.&#160; Another  most recent client came in with her little girl &amp; she is pregnant &amp; is  due in April of 2012.&#160; She wants to volunteer at Focus.&#160; I asked her to fill out  an application &amp; I interviewed her even though I spoke with her as a client  not to long ago for this is different.&#160; She said that I helped her to 'choose  life'.&#160; I said that I thank God that she did.&#160; She will start on Thursday &amp;  she will give me 3 or 4 hours then to help out at Focus.&#160; Thank you Lord for we  do need more help in the center.&#160; After she left there were about 4 other women  who came in for assistance.&#160; Kathy gave&#160; a pregnancy test to a young girl &amp; it was negative.&#160; She did some teaching too.&#160; I did some much  needed office work until I ran out of ink, making the copies.&#160; I will  have to go  later tonight, before I go home to Staples, &amp; buy somemore ink cartiages, so that I can finish my  work tomorrow.&#160; I will ask Lucy tomorrow to type out two 'ThankYou' letters to  the two churches that recently blessed us with tithing money, from their parishes.&#160; It will look more professional.&#160; I finished the application to St.  John&#160;of Rochester parish for tithing money, to help Focus out, with our needs.&#160;  They blessed us last year but it took a little longer this year to fill out the  application &amp; to sent it back to them.&#160; It's never to late, for it will come  when we need it the most, for God is good &amp; God is great!&#160; </span></span></strong></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></strong></p><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wednesday, October 26, at Focus</strong></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>We were so very bust at&#160;the&#160;pregnancy center&#160;today  &amp;

going out,&#160;of the parking  lot,&#160;when he stopped me to tell me that he would be back after lunch, for he's  on the front lines with Sheila on her time.&#160; I asked if he would get me a  hamburger &amp; Martha a chicken sandwich for our quick lunches later in.&#160; I  asked him if he wanted some money now &amp; he said to pay me later.&#160; I said  "okay" &amp; off he went.&#160; I went into the center to go get the signs,  literature box &amp; the mega phone&#160;&amp; then Kathy came in to work in the  center this afternoon.&#160; Carole had to work so she won't be with us again today.&#160;  I was now outside &amp; started to get an update of what was going on at Planned  Parenthood.&#160; Sheila gave me a report &amp; then had to go &amp; as she was  leaving she told me that she would call me later.&#160; I said "okay &amp; have a  blessed day".&#160; I was hoping that Martha would be there with me at 1pm but she  came around 1:20pm &amp; said that there was an accident on the expressway.&#160; I  was so glad that she was here now, safe &amp; sound.&#160; Addison, Dan &amp; Adolf  were with me praying the Rosary &amp; they went across the street to continue to  pray &amp; I was alone on the side where the bushes are in front of Planned  Parenthood.&#160; We called out to every car that came in &amp; went out of the  parking lot.&#160; Paul indicated that the lunch was ready but it was another 45  minutes later &amp; now about 2pm&#160; when I asked Martha if I could run into the  center to woof down the Wendy's hamburger &amp; said "yes".&#160; I went into the  office &amp; started to talk to Suzanne our Thursday client advocate when I  heard&#160;someone walking down the hallway.&#160; I peeked out the door to see two police  officers walking towards me.&#160; Hi officer Chris how are you.&#160; "Fine" was the  response back.&#160; I then said "now what did I do"?&#160; The officer Chris said  "nothing Mary this is officer Vincent &amp; he's with the Crime Prevention  Unit.&#160; "Hello" I responded back.&#160; "Can we talk in your office Mary, there's no  problem" officer Chris stated.&#160; I walked in &amp; said to Suzanne "could you  leave for a few minutes Suzanne.&#160; Then officer Chris said :that's not  necessary.&#160; I then introduced Suzanne to the two police officers.&#160; Okay what's  up I stated.&#160; The officer Chris said that the business Buckpitt who is next to  Planned Parenthood wrote a letter to the Mayor.&#160; "Oh really" I said back what  about?&#160; Then officer Vincent told me all the bogus complaints which said that we  we're nice &amp; that they didn't like the graphic pictures that we have out  there on the sidewalk.&#160; I know that we are really right in front of Buckpitt  &amp; not Planned Parenthood but that's because of the Buffer Zone, which isn't  our fault.&#160; They were told that we had a right to be there &amp; to protest the  way that we want to &amp; they couldn't do anything about it legally.&#160; Officer  Chris also asked them to drive their vehicles not to close to the sidewalk where  we stand on the sidewalk.&#160; I said "thank you officer Chris" for he is our  advocate &amp; go between if we have any problems on the front lines.&#160; Then  officer Vincent said that you wrote a boycott message on a sign &amp; put it on  your car in front of their business.&#160; I said that was about 2 years ago &amp; I  had written on it:&#160; 'Boycott Buckpitt for they don't care that children are  being killed'.&#160; Then officer Vincent said that wasn't in the letter, for in the  letter it stated something different &amp; trust me it wasn't nice &amp; I would  never talk that way, so I'm really mad now.&#160; I asked if I could write a letter  to the Mayor &amp; officer Chris said that anyone could write a letter to the  Mayor so I said then I will.&#160; Then I said "what about mediation"?&#160; Then officer  Vincent said that he wasn't interested in that &amp; I then said "well I am very  interested in that &amp; I hope that will take place in the near future".&#160; I  thought please writ that down in your report &amp; that I didn't write what he  said that I wrote on the sing too, to clear my name.&#160; Then officer Vincent asked  if Buckpitt opens it's gate by where we stand we know not to be in front of the  entrance way.&#160; I said that we knew that &amp; they have opened it up on occasion  &amp; we don't stand in front of it or have signs in front of it.&#160; Then officer  Chris sated that we've been out there protesting for the past 16 years.&#160; I said  "yes we have &amp; we know the rules".&#160; I said that we used to talk to some of  the men who come into Buckpitt but we don't do that anymore or haven't for years  &amp; that we took the sign down from the tree which is in front of their  business which is on the public sidewalk &amp; now the pole which is right near  the entrance of Buckpitt&#160;&amp; now have it on a stool by the fence.&#160; The officer  Vincent stated that a car was leaving Buckpitt &amp;&#160; he said that he couldn't  see &amp; Martha told him to move a little further out, it sounded like good  advice to me but the driver complained to Buckpitt about it.&#160; I said that Martha  isn't rude to anyone &amp; it probably was me that said it.&#160; I said you have no  idea what some of the guys in there say to us as they come in &amp; as they get  out of their car &amp; when they leave &amp; we put up with the abuse &amp;  don't bother the Mayor with this nonsense.&#160; It's all kid stuff &amp; when we  want to concentrate on talking to the girls &amp; guys going into Planned  Parenthood where they're murdering little babies.&#160; We want to save lives &amp;  not to be bothered with Buckpitt whose mad because we're in front of their  business.&#160; Okay thank you Mary &amp; if you need me for anything then just call  911 &amp; tell then that I'm the advocate for you.&#160; I said "thank you so very  much officer Chris for all that you do for us pro lifers".&#160; Then he said that he  tried to contact the par legal with Judge Morris's office in regards of the  woman who made a threat to my life about a month ago, as she was driving into  Planned Parenthood.&#160; The Judge doesn't look at a threat as a reason for a  warrant.&#160; I disagree with him that's for sure &amp; he looked down &amp; said  "yes I know &amp; gave me the definition of harassment &amp; that was one of  them.&#160; Judge Morris (Rainbow) is pro life but much mistaken about this  decision.&#160; When one threatens your life one should be held accountable  especially if one is going into Planned Parenthood to have her baby killed by  the abortionist in there. What's wrong with this picture?&#160; I took my hand out of  my pocket &amp; said "my hand is sweaty &amp; then I shook each of their hands  &amp; said then I said "thank you again officer Chris&#160;for trying to make the  arrest happen, good bye &amp; have a great day".&#160; "Good bye they both said back  to me" &amp; left.&#160; I quickly ate my hamburger &amp; then left to go back  outside &amp; when I did I saw that the two police officers were parked on the  other side of the vets who are across the street.&#160; I then went around the corner  &amp; only to hear someone shouting from across the street, it was a woman who  was screaming "woman's rights, women's rights", she was standing near Adolf.&#160; I  observed for a few minutes then I saw that she had hit his sign that was  holding.&#160; I walked over to the 2 police cars &amp; hollered Office Chris is  Officer Chris hear.&#160; "I'm hear Mary", he was in the car on the right.&#160; I said  "there's a woman on the sidewalk who's hollering &amp; I know that she has a  right to do that but she just hit Adolf's sing &amp; there might be a problem".&#160;  "Okay, I'll be right over" said Officer Chris.&#160; The two police cars went over to  where the woman was standing next to Adolf who appeared calm.&#160; A few minutes  later the one officer's car left &amp; Officer Chris was getting back into his  car.&#160; The woman kept on saying to him "women's rights they have a right".&#160; As  officer Chris went back in his car he turned his head around to say to me "every  thing is all right Mary".&#160; I hollered back to him "thanks Officer Chris".&#160; He  drove off &amp; Martha informed me that she was trying to talk to her but all  she did was swear &amp; say some very not so nice things back to her.&#160; The woman  hollered to Martha that she had been raped twice &amp; that she married her  second rapist.&#160; Why I don't know why she did that what reason did she have &amp;  it sounded that they're not together any longer.&#160; Martha told me that the mega  phone just gave out so she said that she would go back in the center to get the  other one &amp; bring it out.&#160; In the meantime &amp; tried to holler over her  voice saying "choose life, choose life over her "women have a right , women have  a right".&#160; Then I set off a mental shock to her, I mentioned that I was gang  raped &amp; conceived twins in that rape &amp; that I didn't abort them".&#160; I  could see that she was taken back &amp; we connected.&#160; She was now leaving to go  to her car that was parked in the vets parking lot &amp; the doctor was now  outside in his parking lot talking to her &amp; showing her the sign parking for  Customers Only all others will be towed.&#160; Then he pointed over to our parking  lot &amp; I thought on no that's to close to us if she's on the verge.&#160; I pray  that she gets help but she won't listen to Martha or I at this time maybe later  on we can try if she comes back again which she told Martha earlier that she was  planning to come back again.&#160; She got into her car &amp; drove away.&#160; I fell so  sorry for her &amp; I know her pain but she can't advocate for the victimizers  that are killing&#160;children, in cold blood, in Planned Parenthood.&#160; I wish her the  very best &amp; lots of healing &amp; for her to find the Lord, first &amp; for  most, who loves her with an everlasting love.&#160; Martha was now back with the  other mega phone &amp; we continued to sidewalk counsel, to try to save lives.&#160;  Now it was time for all the people&#160;who came in to  kill their precious babies were coming out now, with their sweet &amp; innocent  babies dead,&#160; who are now in the refrigerator in Planned Parenthood.&#160; How  horrible is this to process.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Just about an hour later the UPS truck with the  driver that doesn't like us either drove so close to the curb&#160; &amp; stopped his  truck right in front of Buckpitt front door on the street.&#160; Martha said that she  was going over to talk to him &amp; tell him to keep away from the curb where we  are standing.&#160; I said "Martha I don't know about that" &amp; she said "I'm  already in Dutch", she was referring of me telling her that her name was  mentioned in the letter that Buckpitt wrote to the Mayor.&#160; Over she goes to  where he was &amp; asked him to drive more&#160; carefully &amp; not so close to the  curb.&#160; He just looked at her with a blank face &amp; didn't say a word &amp;  walked into Buckpitt with the packages.&#160; After we went into the center later on  I called to make out a complaint against him &amp; his driving &amp; his  attitude &amp; that this was a second compliant that I have made.&#160; He will be  called into the office to explain his behavior &amp; hopefully he won't get to  close to the curb when we're standing there anymore.&#160; Hopefully we won't have  any more trouble with him again better yet just get another driver for this  route for I'm tired of fighting him too over all these years.&#160; Nothing seems to  change.&#160; Same old, same old problems with the same old people.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">When I went into the office, for Suzanne was  gone now, I saw a note on&#160;the desk&#160;that one of our babies were born.&#160;Beautiful  baby girl, Leah Rochelle, was born.&#160; Mother &amp; daughter are healthy &amp; mom  is back in school.&#160;Praise God!!&#160; See it's worth the good fight to try to save  lives.&#160; This was baby #17, who was born from our center.&#160; Not all the moms were  abortion minded but they did come into Focus for a pregnancy test &amp; we  assisted them during their pregnancies &amp; we are proud to know that their  babies are now being born.&#160;

the Mass downtown was going to be  longer than usual.&#160; I was glad because Marianne came to drop off some big items  to us at the center for our clients.&#160; Both Kathy &amp; Miss T called me saying  that they were both coming a little late today &amp; I said that was fine.&#160; Then  Kay &amp; Jack came from St. Pius X Church &amp; dropped off many bags of girl  clothes from a parishioner there.&#160; I said that I would sent a 'Thank You' letter  to her &amp; Kay said that she would appreciate it very much.&#160; Then after they  left our Landlord came to get his rent check &amp; Martha &amp; I asked him for  a deal which he took.&#160; So really he has paid for the new carpet that was  installed recently at the center.&#160; We will be going back to our usual rent&#160;of  $1,800 in January of 2012.&#160; He was very nice.&#160; While he was there I asked him if  would turn the heat down, for it was to&#160;warm &amp; it was uncomfortable for us.&#160;  He did.&#160; Someone had put it up to 73 degrees &amp; he put it down to 69 degrees  which was better &amp; if someone puts it back up again then he asked me&#160;to call  him.&#160; Okay, but I hope that we all can get along,&#160;in the building&#160;&amp; not be  angry about this.&#160; Then another drop off of occurred.&#160; It was a nice lady &amp;  her husband came &amp; dropped off 3 car seats &amp; some other things for the  center.&#160; I said "thank you' so very much for your kindness to us.&#160; In the  meantime Martha was giving a pregnancy test to a young girl that came in for  one.&#160; She was also educated &amp; was grateful for Martha's help.&#160; Then Carole  came in &amp; Kathy &amp; Miss T.&#160; I was glad to see them all.&#160; Carole said she  had some clothes for Cleveland, our street friend,&#160;like pants, a shirt, shoes,  socks &amp; a jacket.&#160; So when we see him again we'll get him ready for the  colder days ahead.&#160; Then Carole told Martha &amp; I that she got a job &amp;  won't be with us for the next 3 weeks.&#160; I was so disappointed but she has to do  what she has to do.&#160; She's working on pricing a whole house for an Estate Sale  &amp; once it's over she'll be&#160;back with us,&#160;unless she gets another job, but I  doubt it because of the winter coming, probably not until next spring.&#160; She says  that she doesn't like to drive in the winter.&#160; Oh no!!&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Martha was heading out to the front lines with Miss  T while I was going to help Kathy in the center but somehow it got reversed.&#160;  Martha was inside &amp; I was outside.&#160; I was with Miss T for awhile but she got  hungry &amp; wanted to go in to eat lunch, for she said that she &amp; her  unborn baby were hungry.&#160; She's over 2 months pregnant, how sweet.&#160; I was by  myself for about an hour or so.&#160; I wasn't prepared to stay outside so I had my  reading glasses on &amp; not my sunglasses.&#160; Ick!&#160; I talked to a young guy that  was sitting on the wooded ledge to where I was sidewalk counseling.&#160; I gave him  a Truth packet &amp; some other pieces of literature for him to read.&#160; Then he  went back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; He said that he brought his girlfriend here  but he didn't know why.&#160; I told him before he left that they do abortions here  &amp; the abortionist is here right now.&#160; He asked if they did other things  too.&#160; I said "yes, but they are evil".&#160; I was glad that he took the packet to  give to his girlfriend.&#160; Then I looked down on the sidewalk &amp; I saw a lot of  disturbing phrases, that someone wrote in chalk,&#160;on the cement.&#160; They were to  disturbing to share with you.&#160; So&#160; when Martha came out on the front lines I  went into the center to get some hot soapy water to get rid of all that  disturbing stuff that was written.&#160; Some very sick dude, that's for sure.&#160; As I  was about to rejoin Martha, three girls came into the center asking for a  pregnancy test.&#160; I asked if all three girls were planning on getting a pregnancy  test &amp; the one replied that it was just her.&#160; I asked her if she wanted the  other two girls in with her when she takes the test &amp; she said "yes they can  stay".&#160; I said back "okay, lets get started".&#160; Before &amp; after the test  I&#160;gave&#160;them some educational brochures &amp; DVD's &amp; a CD for free.&#160; The I  talked to them about birth control &amp; how dangerous it was &amp; to live  lives of Chastity that would please the Lord.&#160; As the one girl was leaving she  said that she wanted to be a OB/GYN doctor someday &amp; to save lives.&#160; While  the girls were there the on girl said that she had a daughter &amp; she liked to  be pregnant &amp; to feel the baby grow &amp; kick.&#160; They were not abortion  minded, thank God.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I hurried to get the pail of water with the soap  suds to go back out to be with Martha.&#160; Boy was I shocked to what she told me  when I returned to the front lines after being away for 40 minutes.&#160; Poor  baby!!&#160; First the guy came back with the chalk &amp; wrote more junky stuff on  the sidewalk where Martha was standing.&#160; He even said some really bad things to  her too.&#160; It figures.&#160; She kept on praying.&#160; After he left harassing her then  one of the Buckpitt workers came so close to the curb where Martha was standing  that her burned rubber.&#160; I said that I was going to call 911 on this.&#160; About 10  minutes later Officer Mike came &amp; took the report right in front of Buckputt  &amp; Co.'s business.&#160; I hope that they heard us taking through the windows.&#160; I  asked if Officer Chris was on duty, for he is our advocate, but he wasn't on  duty.&#160; the officer said that he will look up the license number &amp; then call  the guy on the phone.&#160; Thanks officer Mike we really do appreciate it.&#160; Then  Martha told him of the creepy guy with the chalk &amp; the obscenities.&#160; He said  if he comes back again just call the police &amp; we will talk to him at that  time.&#160; I said" thanks Office Mike, we will".&#160; He said "good bye &amp; went back  to his car, hopefully to call this nasty guy at Buckpitt who has bothered us for  many years.&#160; What's wrong with these people in there????</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Martha went into the center &amp;  I stayed outside  for another hour &amp; then Miss T helped me bring everything back into the  center.&#160; Today I saw so many cars come out of Planned Parenthood with the mother  driving their daughter.&#160; One young girl made a freaky face at me.&#160; It was so  disturbing, to say the least.&#160; How sad was all of this.&#160; We think that Planned  Parenthood changed their abortions days to Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays.&#160; We'll just  have to keep on being out there to try to save lives, for Christ, of both the  babies &amp; their mothers &amp; fathers too.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Kathy &amp; Miss T had left &amp; the door bell  rang &amp; it was on of our regular clients.&#160; She came to get some diapers &amp;  clothes for her 4 children &amp; to spend some quite time with us.&#160; We invited  for a chicken supper which she accepted.&#160; We had a nice three way conversation.&#160;  Then she went into the Material Aid Room to look at the clothes &amp; to look at  the books for herself &amp; for her older boy who's 12,&#160;for she has a 2 year old  &amp; she just&#160;had twins about 6 months ago.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; it  was Rick at the door for the last '40 Days for Life' meeting.&#160; We talked about  the Victory celebration at Focus this Sunday, which is the last day of the  campaign, at 12 noon.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was Pat coming to the meeting  so there was us four.&#160; After the meeting ended Martha took our client home &amp;  I did some last minute things in the office &amp; went home too.&#160;
