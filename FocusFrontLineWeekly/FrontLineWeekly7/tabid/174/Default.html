The abortionist was there killing babies today.&#160; We had a large team of pro lifers out this afternoon.&#160; There was Rona, John, Tony (he stayed in his van &amp; said the Divine Mercy prayers), Jerry, Bill, &amp; then Rob came around 2pm &amp; myself.&#160; We had 3 huge signs ( 2 were graphic &amp; the other one was of a baby that said 'LIFE' at the top of the sign) out there today plus our smaller graphic signs.&#160; It was very effective.&#160; A young man walked by &amp; told Rob &amp; I that his girlfriend snuck an abortion behind his back &amp; he still was upset about that.&#160; I went &amp; got some post abortion literature for men in the center &amp; gave it to him.&#160; Rob brought him into the center to show him around.&#160; He was one hurting man &amp; said to him, as he passed by me on the sidewalk, that I was sorry for his loss.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Please check out: </strong></font><a href="http://www.postabortionhelp.org/Men/article2.html"><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>http://www.postabortionhelp.org/Men/article2.html</strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong><font color="#0000ff">.</font> </strong></font></p><div><font size="4"><strong>A car pulled into Planned Parenthood &amp;

I didn't want Planned Parenthood to measure &amp; to take us further away from the entrance.&#160; Don't trust Planned Parenthood.&#160; I the noticed the old coot neighbor Jim Bovay, who lives across the street looking at us.&#160; He then decided to come over to us &amp; stand right in front of our faces.&#160; I picked up the phone, just in case I had to use it, &amp; told him to go away from us, for he didn't need to be over here &amp; in our faces causing trouble.&#160; He smirked at me &amp; said that it was his sidewalk too.&#160; I said back to him "you are harassing us &amp; you have no right to do that on your sidewalk".&#160; "You're&#160;nuts Mary".&#160; This&#160;is his usual reply to me.&#160;Good bye Jim.&#160; He walked back over to his condo, across the street,&#160;&amp; went in &amp; closed the door.&#160; Good boy.&#160; Some people&#160;never change, I do hope he does, for he will be surprised when he dies.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.kidscareguide.com/wp-content/uploads/baby-clothes.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Then between the bashes I saw that he was walking over to Martha &amp; I.&#160; He came around the bushes &amp; sat down on the bench with his cigarette in his mouth.&#160; Comfort weed, so they think.&#160;He began to talk,&#160;asking why we were bothering these people.&#160; I said to educate them for they are killing little babies in there.&#160; Then he began to say all the wrong things.&#160; He exclaimed that it wasn't a baby it was just an Embryo, with no rights because it isn't a baby, free to dispose of at will.&#160; How sad.&#160; He asked me if I was a foster home child.&#160; I said no but I was a abused home child.&#160; I then said to him that he was saying that unless everything was great for the child he or she should die if it didn't look to good for him or her.&#160; I said then we all should be dead then.&#160; There is no one living that has a perfect life.&#160; He said that his mother&#160;had an abortion.&#160; I said that I am sorry for your loss of your brother or sister.&#160; He smirked &amp; said to me that "it was only an Embryo".&#160; Oh brother, how very&#160;sad is&#160;this case.&#160; I&#160;said to him that I was raped &amp; molested &amp; an incest survivor &amp; he got up &amp; left, right away &amp; went back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; See dear man, no one's life is perfect, but life is precious never the less.&#160;</font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/5_7/flash/nice.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

told her that I had her $200 for her that was given by a generous donor.&#160; She said that she was&#160;coming over for she had to be careful for she had sprained her ankle.&#160; Oh no!!&#160; Poor Pat.&#160;

They came back with me to the center.&#160;As&#160;I was pulling in the driveway to the center I noticed that Maria was standing on the brick side of the building of Planned Parenthood holding her sign that read "I REGRET MY ABORTION".&#160; I waved at her &amp; went into the center to show Anne around &amp; to talk with her for awhile.&#160; It was about 12:40pm &amp; I was expecting Martha there around 1pm so I wasn't worried.&#160; Anne said good bye &#160;&amp; then I went to the sidewalk to say to Maria &amp; o tell her that I would be right out but when I turned the corner she wasn't there.&#160; I looked in the parking lot &amp; saw that the abortionist was there for her dark blue car was parked by the back door.&#160; It made me sick &amp; I wanted to get out on the sidewalk as soon as I could.&#160; I went back into the center wondering where Martha was &amp; why did Maria go before her 2 hours were up?&#160; I started to put the food away &amp; went on to make 2 ham sandwiches for Martha &amp; I for lunch.&#160; As I was finished making up the sandwiches the doorbell rang &amp; went to answer it &amp; there was Maria standing there.&#160; I said "what happened Maria where did you go"?&#160; She said that she left to go Subway to get a sandwich.&#160; I said that I was making sandwiches for Martha &amp; I for I didn't have time to make them at home this morning for I was running late for church.&#160; So it made sense to me to eat my sandwich with Maria instead of eating I outside on the front lines.&#160; As&#160;I was finishing the sandwich&#160;my cell phone rang.&#160; I answered the phone thinking that it was Martha calling to say that she wasn't coming today but it wasn't Martha it was a woman who told me that her friend's daughter was going to have an abortion at Planed Parenthood at 1pm.&#160; What!&#160; It was now 1:20pm, my heart sank &amp; I felt sick.&#160; I asked her why she didn't call me earlier &amp; she said that she just found out &amp; her friend told her to call the Focus Center to intervene.&#160; I said I needed to go &amp; then hung up.&#160; I dropped everything &amp; went out to the sidewalk with the literature box &amp; one sign &amp; the mega phone.&#160; No one was going in so I just hollered to everyone who was in Planned Parenthood already.&#160; I went over to the brick side of the building so I could be closer to the waiting room.&#160; I then saw Martha walking up the sidewalk &amp; used the mega phone to tell her what just happened.&#160;She went back into he center to get the Our Lady of Guadeloupe sign &amp; the picture of Jesus holding the aborted baby crying.&#160; The wind was blowing so hard that we couldn't putout any more signs today.&#160; I called out saying that we could help everyone &amp; that abortion was taking a life &amp; that the baby's heartbeat was taking place just 18 to 20 days after conception &amp; so on.&#160; After about an half hour I went back over to be with Martha &amp; told her that I was going into the center to see if Maria was still there.&#160; She said okay &amp; that she would be fine out there alone.&#160;I went into the center &amp; saw that Maria was there sitting at the desk folding up our new brochures.&#160; I said "thank you Maria"&#160;&amp; spoke with her for a few minutes then left.&#160; She said that got to the sidewalk around 12 noon &amp; stayed until 12:45pm to go to get a sandwich.&#160; I said that there was a good chance that the girl that I got the phone call about saw you holding&#160;your&#160;sign&#160;&amp; went back home, without having an abortion.&#160; That could have happen I said to her.&#160;&#160;Maria said that she felt lead to go out to the sidewalk early today.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; I went back outside to be with Martha.&#160; A few minutes later I saw 3 young girls walking up the street going towards Planned Parenthood on the brick side of the building.&#160; Martha flagged them over towards us.&#160; They walked over to us &amp; I lead them to the center to talk&#160;to Maria who is African American &amp; so were the girls, so they could relate to one another.&#160; I rang the doorbell to give Maria a heads up &amp; then brought the 3 girls into the center.&#160; Maria brought the girls into the new Rose Room for counseling &amp; a pregnancy test for one of the girls.&#160; I turned on the TV which had a DVD in it that showed the pictures of a baby in the womb.&#160; It is an excellent DVD that Father C. burned for us.&#160; I set up the pregnancy test for Maria &amp; gave the girls the Truth packets, for each of them then left for Maria to counsel.&#160; I&#160;went back to the front lines&#160; to be with Martha.&#160; The wind was blowing her away at times.&#160; She said that the sign she was holding blew up the street a ways but she retrieved it.&#160; She also said that she handed out 2 Truth packets to 2 girls that were walking out of Planned Parenthood&#160;&amp; spoke to the girls for a short time.&#160; About a half an hour later we saw that the 3 girls were walking up the sidewalk &amp; as they passed us on the sidewalk they said to Martha &amp; I that they wanted to volunteer.&#160; We said that would be great &amp; that we will be on the sidewalk again tomorrow from 1-5pm.&#160; "Okay" they said with smiles on their faces &amp; then walked up the street towards E. Main St., probably to catch the bus.&#160; They were so young.&#160; &#160;Great job Maria!!&#160; As we were talking to the girls Maria was driving by &amp; gave us a honk to say good bye.&#160; See you next week my friend.</font></strong>&#160;</p><font color="#ff0000"><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><strong>The school bus driver passes us by, when we are out there on the front lines &amp; gives us a honk &amp; a wave &amp; so do some of the children on his bus.&#160; It's great to experience the love.&#160; A young woman was coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I called over to her from the fence by the bushes.&#160; I noticed that she was coming over to Martha &amp; I, so I told Martha to get ready.&#160; Just then the woman arrived from around the bushes &amp; stopped to talk to us.&#160; The first thing she said was "why are you hollering at these girls most of them are hear for contraceptives".&#160; I then said to her that some contraceptives can cause an early abortion .&#160; I then offered her the Truth packet to which she replied that she was a medical student &amp; she didn't need it.&#160; I then said to her that that was scary for me to hear that a medical student didn't want to learn the truth about something that is pertaining to medicine &amp; that if you become a doctor I don't want you to take of me.&#160; Well how's that for an ear full.&#160; After that scolding she seemed to change her attitude towards what Martha &amp; I were trying to tell her. She then said that it scares the girls when we holler &amp; for us to go into Planned Parenthood to talk to the staff &amp; look around.&#160; Gulp, my stomach turned around inside me.&#160; I then said&#160; Planned Parenthood has tried to sue us&#160;that for they are the ones that have put up the bushes &amp; made the Yellow Line, on the sidewalk, for us not to cross over to be able to speak calmly to the people going into Planned Parenthood, to be lied to &amp; deceived &amp; to have their babies killed.&#160; They don't want the girls to know the truth &amp; to get the right kind of help for them.&#160; We have a pregnancy center right next to this yellow building &amp; I pointed over to where we are located &amp; at the center we help our clients with free pregnancy test &amp; counseling, referrals &amp; free baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; We don't kill, they do.&#160; She said that she agreed to that we were doing at the center.&#160; Martha mentioned that abortion is against God's law that says "Thou shall not kill", she also agreed to that statement, for she seemed to know God.&#160; Then the medical student said "I have spoken to Rachel Phelps, who is the abortionist at Planned Parenthood, &amp; she is a nice person &amp; thinks that she is doing good".&#160; I quickly replied saying "no she is not a good person for a good person would not take a life, &amp; that you don't do an evil to bring forth a good, she is greatly misguided &amp; we pray that she will stop killing babies &amp; do good with her degree".&#160; She seemed to understand so much more then she did when she first arrived on the sidewalk.&#160; I then took a chance &amp; re offered her the Truth packet &amp; said to her that it would make me very happy if she took it.&#160; She smiled &amp; reached out her hand to take it.&#160; I got greedy so I offered her the DVD of Growth &amp; Development, in the womb, &amp; included in the case was the Maafa21:Black Genocide in the 21st Century DVD &amp; also our Focus Center brochure &amp; the rubberized 12 week old baby.&#160; She took it all.&#160; WOW!!&#160; Praise God for the grace for her to turn around.&#160; Now she is an educated medical student&#160;&amp; I told her that I would not mind being her patient.&#160; She smiled again.&#160; Martha asked her her name &amp; she said it was Julia.&#160; So when she was leaving we both said "good bye Dr. Julia" &amp; she waved as she was leaving the parking lot of Planned Parenthood.&#160; What an experience this was this afternoon.</strong>&#160; </font></font></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><strong>A car stopped on the street &amp; the woman driver hollered out the window "do you have any of those beads, meaning the Rosary"?&#160; Martha said "yes we do &amp; we have baby clothes too for your baby, so turn around &amp; come follow me".&#160; She turned her car around &amp; followed Martha into the parking lot to the center &amp; then to the Material Aid Room.&#160;&#160;She&#160;helped them to get some nice things.&#160; One of the young girls then asked for a pregnancy test, so Martha gave her a pregnancy test.&#160; Then the other woman said that she will come back another time to get a pregnancy test.&#160; Martha said "that's fine we will be here".&#160; They both received a Truth packet &amp; some Rosaries &amp; some nice things for the cute little baby girl.&#160; They left saying "thank you" to Martha.&#160; Then Martha came back to the front lines &amp; Tucker had just arrived for his 4-6pm shift. &#160;A few minutes later, a woman with two children, a boy &amp; a girl about 6 &amp; 7 years of age came from behind the bushes.&#160; We approached her &amp; offered a pregnancy test.&#160; She made it sound like that she needed one &amp; we lead her into the center for one.&#160; But once she got to the center she changed her mind &amp; wanted condoms.&#160; Martha told her that we don't hand out condoms &amp; she told her the truth about them.&#160; I came in to the room &amp; heard what they were talking about &amp; then went to the counseling room to get her brochures about condoms, to educate her.&#160; She also picked up a few things for her children then left.&#160; After she left Martha clued me in that she wanted condoms &amp; not the literature talking about them.&#160; Martha educated&#160;her the best way she could &amp; she did take the brochures, so we felt that there was a job well done, though she left a bad taste in Martha's mouth,&#160;it was probably her attitude.&#160; Hope all goes well for her &amp; that she doesn't have anymore sex outside of marriage, that will&#160;affect the lives of her 2 precious children, that she is responsible for.&#160; Martha went back outside to be with Tucker &amp; I went into the Material Aid Room to start to put things away, that I had in my car, from the second hand store that dropped them off in my garage to bring to the center for our clients.&#160;

of course brownies.&#160; Yummy!&#160; Finally the pizza &amp; wings came &amp; the delivery man said that he was stopped by the police, I guess for speeding.&#160; I hope it wasn't because of our pizza.&#160; They knocked $3.00 off the price, which was a deal.&#160; The pizza &amp; wings were a hit, thank God.&#160; Worth waiting for.&#160; Martha had made her famous macaroni salad &amp; that tied us over too, before the pizza came.&#160; Anne had brought us a fairly new computer given to us by my former boss which is her husband.&#160; They will deliver us a refrigerator this coming week for the center.&#160; How nice of the Orlando's.&#160; We were blessed with a good monetary collection for the work of the center.&#160; We are blessed with generous people to help us.&#160; The&#160; Landlord came by for the rent &amp; I asked him if I could get a $30 reduction for buying the paint, for the counseling room.&#160; He said "yes".&#160; Thank you Lord for melting his heart.&#160; There was great conversation &amp; a happy time, in the love, of friends.&#160; I showed the people the new Rose Room &amp; they all loved it.&#160; After everyone had left &amp; there was only Martha &amp; Pat &amp; I left, I took some time to talk to Pat.&#160; Martha then went into the bathroom &amp; was there for awhile when Pat had said loudly to Martha if she was okay.&#160; Martha replied "no".&#160; I went to the door of the bathroom &amp; Martha came out.&#160; She said that she was very dizzy &amp; had vomited.&#160; Oh no!&#160; She went &amp; sat on the sofa to get her barrens &amp; Pat &amp; I tried to comfort her.&#160; She finally said that she was feeling better but needed to go home.&#160; I understand poor Martha.&#160; After she left I again sat down to talk to Pat again &amp; then I gave her some things, for her two great grandbabies, given to Pat from Anne.&#160; It was diapers &amp; formula.&#160; I gave Pat all the leftover deserts to take home to her family, which I know they would enjoy, especially her grandson Aaron, who is a growing boy.&#160; After Pat had left, my friend in the Taxi company, which is located in the room next to the office, &amp; asked me if he could help me.&#160; I quickly said "yes".&#160; He put back the chairs &amp; vacuumed &amp; washed the dishes.&#160; I said that I would wash the dishes &amp; he said "I know how to wash dishes".&#160; Tickabu, do you have a brother?&#160; The Taxi company is owned by nice people from Ethiopia.&#160; What a blessing they are to us.&#160; What a beautiful morning &amp; afternoon, in the Lord.&#160; Hope that you feel better dear Martha.&#160; Off I went for the 4:30pm Mass.&#160; I went back after Mass to do some more things at the center &amp; then I went over to my friends house,&#160;to babysit.</font> </strong></font></font></p><p align="left">&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff">Monday, May 3, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://wordincarnate.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/silhouette-of-woman-praying.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I waved back to her wishing that she would stop to help me.&#160; My prayers got answered real fast.&#160; There she was turning around &amp; parking at the brick side of Planned Parenthood where this girl was standing.&#160; I went over to greet her &amp; to give her a heads up on the situation.&#160; Maria approached the girl to tell her that abortion was wrong.&#160; She said to Maria &amp; I&#160; "I've got a child &amp;&#160;I have had&#160;an abortion &amp; if&#160;I get pregnant again&#160;I would abort that baby too".&#160; So also said that&#160; if her young sister ever gets pregnant she would kick her stomach in.&#160; Oh so rough &amp; tough.&#160; It sounds horrible, which it is, but you really know that she is in so much pain from her past abortion &amp; she is lashing out.&#160; I handed her a Truth packet which she took &amp; then I&#160; was planning to go back into the center, to wait for Chris to set up&#160;our new computer, so I was going to leave her to talk with Maria, for Maria is post abortive x2 &amp; she would be able to counsel her, in getting&#160;the help that she really needs.&#160; She holds her sign, on the sidewalk,&#160;that reads "I REGRET MY ABORTIONS".&#160; It is powerful message for people to see &amp;

the tests indicated that she was carrying a baby with dwarfism.&#160; The doctors in England wanted her to abort her precious daughter &amp; she couldn't find a doctor that would take her pregnancy on without suggesting for her to have an abortion until she finally found a good doctor that cared for her during her pregnancy, that didn't suggest for her to have an abortion.&#160;

I said that we at the Focus Center do free pregnancy tests &amp; that we were located right next to this big yellow building.&#160; I gave a Truth packet &amp; told him not to give it to anyone in there if they ask to take it.&#160;

was going to have an abortion this week, her mother was making her, &amp; she was crying.&#160; He said that she was walking up Gibbs St. probably to get a bus on Main St.., I walked over to see that she was so far away, for me to reach her, so I said to this 'White Knight' "go run &amp; give her this package of information &amp; save her baby"!!&#160; He did, he ran like the wind &amp; he caught up with her to talk to her &amp; to give her the packet of information. It also had the rubberized 12 week old baby &amp; the growth &amp; development chart on the back of the card,&#160;in the literature bag.&#160; He came back into the center about 5 minutes later saying that he wanted to work for me.&#160; I said "you have&#160;a job".&#160; He smiled.&#160; He joined his girlfriend in the Rose Room &amp; I&#160;went back in&#160;&amp; spoke with them for a few more minutes &amp; then we all said good bye.&#160; I thanked him again for all that he did this morning in 'saving lives'.&#160; I think that he felt real good about himself too.&#160; Thank you Lord!!&#160; What a morning &amp; I never come on Monday mornings, maybe I should.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.old-picture.com/indians/pictures/Indian-Woman.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="59" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:vPDDyK0OERTCIM:http://www.old-picture.com/indians/pictures/Indian-Woman.jpg" /></a></font></strong></p><div><p><font size="4"><strong><font color="#000000">After they left I peaked my head outside to see if Maria was okay &amp; she waved at me indicating that she was fine so I went back into the center to see how Chris was doing.&#160;&#160;He also was doing fine &amp; was please with our new gift from our former boss, Matt.&#160; I wanted to go to go to Mass at 12:10pm &amp; it was now about 11:45am when the doorbell rang.&#160; I went to the door to see a woman standing there.&#160; I opened the door &amp; said 'hello, can I help you"?&#160; She answered back to me "the lady outside said that you do free pregnancy tests &amp; I would like one".&#160; I replied "yes, come follow me".&#160; I led her to the Rose Room &amp; she filled out the Intake Sheet, like all the clients do, &amp; I got the test ready for her to take.&#160; She did &amp; she was negative so I spent a few minutes teaching her abstinence &amp; chastity &amp; gave her specific pieces of literature to read that would help you to achieve her goal.&#160; I also gave her the Truth packet with has a Rosary in every packet.&#160; She thanked me &amp; off she went.&#160; I said good bye to Chris &amp; thanked him &amp; gave him a big hug &amp; off I went to Mass.&#160; As I was leaving I waved good bye to Maria up the street.&#160; She said earlier that she will be back next month to counsel in the center &amp; to be out on the street to witness.&#160; Great Maria, we'll miss you.&#160; What a morning, in less than 3 hours, I gave 3 pregnancy tests &amp; counseled &amp; gave away a lot of literature &amp;&#160;I believe, in my heart, one life saved, through the grace of God.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I need to descern if the Lord wants me or someone else to be there, on the sidewalk in front of Planed Parenthood, on Monday mornings?&#160; My goal, which is my prayer,&#160;is to have someone there, all the times that Planned Parenthood is open, from 7:30am to 7pm, Monday through Friday.&#160; Please Lord please sent in your troops!!</font></strong>&#160; </font></p></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Tuesday, May 4, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Martha, John, Jerry&#160;&amp; I got to the center after Mass &amp; Sandy was already there waiting to be let in.&#160; I asked her if she could get the things, that were in my car that needed to be sorted out, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I gave her&#160;my car&#160;keys after I opened up all the rooms in the center.&#160; Martha &amp; John were getting the sign &amp; mega phone &amp; signs to take to the front lines to witness.&#160; I was planning to join them but I never was able to get out to the front lines until about 3:30pm for I &amp; Sandy &amp; later on Melody, when she arrived, were keep very busy, in the center today.&#160;</strong></font></p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs1743/hji/medium/1987-men-beard.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="60" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nWzVIBuFq_P5OM:http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs1743/hji/medium/1987-men-beard.jpg" /></a></strong></font></p><p>&#160;</p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>I saw that a woman&#160;had walked into the center from outside, for we have a landlord that won't fix anything, so the door doesn't catch behind anyone who is leaving unless they shut the door tight which they usually don't.&#160;&#160;So anyone can walk in at in any time.&#160; I saw that she was heading to the Material Aid Room so I figured that she had been here before.

She was appalled at such a sight.&#160; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; also some other pieces of literature &amp; also the cherry on top I gave her the Bella movie to take with her to watch.&#160; I called Compass Care to make an appointment for her to get a free ultrasound of her baby.&#160; She was smiling &amp; so was I.&#160; I opened the door to find her boyfriend in the hallway along with her sister &amp; her baby &amp; her grandmother.&#160; I spoke to them all &amp; encouraged them to be supportive of her.&#160; They agreed.&#160; Thank you for the grace dear Lord to change hearts &amp; minds.&#160; As they were leaving I again reminded them to watch the movie Bella.&#160; All their worries can change in a flash but you can't put the baby back again once you've torn him or her apart.&#160;

walked back into the office to see how Sandy was coming with the packets.&#160; She had made up quite a few so I said that I would go out to give them to the warriors on the sidewalk.&#160; I walked over to the pro lifers when Martha told me that they had to call the police on someone who came into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood hollering "I'm going to kill &amp; there's nothing you can say or do to change my mind".&#160; Lord have Mercy.&#160; The girl &amp; guy came over to John &amp; got into his face &amp; took a packet then throw it at him.&#160; Mary S. called the police &amp;

He was using free speech and a group was angry and started cursing.&#160; It went back and forth a little then a woman got really hot and got in his face pointing her finger.&#160; I was actually on the other side of the building today but saw the whole thing develop, Jerry was across the street facing the PP exit (all could see his sign and crucifix) they saw us all left, right and center and there was&#160; a lot of traffic.&#160; </font><font face="Arial">Anyway, back to John.&#160; The woman started to get physical and touched John, jabbing and finally throwing the packet into the street. Two other women came over and finally with the commotion (caused by them) the young man came tearing around the corner but it did not appear that he touched John. Since there were four of them and I did not know how bad it would get,&#160; I called 911. The young man glanced at me and I felt he knew what I was doing. I calmly asked the operator for a police drive-by as I explained that&#160; a Planned Parenthood patron was getting physical with a protester on the street.&#160;</font><font face="Arial">Two police cars came and went directly into the parking lot. No one came over to any of us.&#160; Believe it or not, three more cops showed up, all going in to the parking lot. We all kept back to a legal position so I don't know if the police spoke to anyone ( maybe Jerry knows)?&#160; No they didn't I found out later.&#160;</font><font face="Arial">They left and then I had to leave. When I left, John was still in the center probably having told you ( Mary) what happened. I told Martha that I was concerned about when the group leaves that they might get crazy again and the police had left. I just wanted you to know and I pray that all protesters stay safe. </font><font face="Arial">I have to say John sure kept his composure and it helped that Martha had sprinkled blessed salt on the sidewalk where he stood.</font></font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/images/300/mother_toddler_play.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

She said that&#160;it&#160;was difficult in getting to the city from Greece, with her health problems, &amp; she &amp; others needed the bus situation to change &amp; so she got a petition that she wanted to give to Mr.Gantt.&#160; Just then a car was driving into Planned Parenthood &amp; she&#160; called over to the driver that this was a slaughter house &amp; for her not to go in.&#160; The girl just looked at her&#160; but&#160;seemed like she was deeply touched by her statement, Martha said to me.&#160; She just kept on saying that this was a slaughter house.&#160; How right you are dear lady.&#160; I hope that Mr. Gantt can help you &amp; please tell him, when you see him, that Planned Parenthood is a slaughter house &amp; to do something about it.&#160; Wishful thinking on my part but one can only dream.&#160; Martha invited her back to come out on the front lines with us &amp; she said that she would when she has more time.&#160; We'll see.</strong></font></p><p><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.graphicsbydezign.com/images/clip-art/food-fast.gif"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="79" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nJuZNnFqsNbFEM:http://www.graphicsbydezign.com/images/clip-art/food-fast.gif" /></a></strong></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">It was around 4:30pm &amp; I reminded everyone that we needed to come in &amp; to eat supper &amp; to get ready to go to the Women's Care Center, for the Bella Hero talk at 6pm.&#160; They gathered up everything &amp; went in for supper.&#160; We had supper &amp; left to go the lecture at 5:30pm we all arrived at 6pm.&#160; I was well attended &amp; it was a blessing of an evening.&#160; Terri, the material aid person, blessed our center with a car seat &amp; 2 bases &amp; baby formula &amp; diapers etc., how nice is that.&#160; The talk was very interesting &amp; then we saw the movie.&#160; Anne cried at the end, how could you not.&#160;</font></strong></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://bestof.provocateuse.com/images/photos/eduardo_verastegui_98.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="113" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:lLsYRaE43ajxbM:http://bestof.provocateuse.com/images/photos/eduardo_verastegui_98.jpg" /></a></font></strong></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">We asked questions about the star of the movie who has sidewalk counseled&#160;&amp; has saved lives through the grace of God.&#160;Check out: 'Bella' Movie Star, Eduardo Verastegui, Saved Real Baby While Researching Film.&#160; </font></strong><a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2007/dec/07121004.html"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2007/dec/07121004.html</font></strong></a><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">.&#160; </font></strong></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">The day was full &amp; eventful, Praise God for His goodness &amp; grace, for His children both big &amp; small.

did four Pregnancy tests.&#160; One after another.&#160; The center was hopping with activity.&#160; We were educating with our literature &amp; words of wisdom from the Good Lord.&#160; Diane stopped by with diapers for our friend Pat's great grand babies, who are growing&#160;up so fast.&#160; Later on Pat stopped by to receive the donations that were given to her by great people that wanted to help her family out.&#160; Also, the diapers that Diane had blessed her with too.&#160; Diane was also included&#160;with the people that generously donate to help Pat &amp; her family out.&#160; Praise God for such great people that are generous &amp; selfless.&#160; God bless them all.&#160; We had people dropping off new stuffed animals for the Material Aid room &amp; what a blessing that will be for our clients children.&#160; So many people to thank for their goodness &amp; kindness, to the work, of the Focus Center.&#160; We couldn't do it without them &amp; their prayers to the dear Lord.&#160; Melody came &amp; started to make up Truth packets, for the ministry.&#160; Sandy was doing pregnancy test &amp; handing out clothes in the Material Aid Room.&#160; Martha, Mary S., Jerry &amp; I were out on the front lines praying &amp; witnessing the Truth.&#160; I went back &amp; forth in &amp; out of the center but at least I got to say, this week to Mary S., who comes for 1 hour on her lunch hour to pray &amp; to witness out in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Thank you all for giving your precious time &amp; love, to our precious babies, that are so unmerciful dismembered, in the name of 'choice'.&#160; </font></strong></p><h3 align="center"><font color="#ff0000" face="Comic Sans MS"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://kunaljanu.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/thing-called-love.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

to pick up some children's clothes for them both.&#160; I asked how David Tobias was doing &amp; he said that he has his nights &amp; days mixed up.&#160; He was up most of the night &amp; is now sleeping like a log.&#160; I said that maybe he will be a night owl, for I am, &amp; he said "not if I can help it".&#160; I hear you.&#160;He took the stroller out of my car &amp; put it against the wall of the building outside.&#160; I asked him if he could help me get some boxes, of children's clothes, out of my car &amp; into the Material Aid Room for me.&#160; He said "yes, of course".&#160; He was in the Material Aid Room picking out some things for his 2 children &amp; then left on his bicycle.&#160; I couldn't believe it.&#160; He put the double stroller strap on his one shoulder &amp; the clothes bag on the other shoulder &amp; off he went down the street.&#160; But before he left he thanked&#160;me again for saving the life of his precious son.&#160; I said that we give the Lord all the&#160;glory, for it was by His grace, for we are only His instruments.&#160; He said "thank you".&#160; I said to say hi to Ann &amp; give the children a kiss &amp;

that Planned Parenthood kills babies in this very building &amp; that they were Racist, killing off the Black Race through abortion &amp; birth control.&#160; We offered him the Maafa 2: Black Genocide in the 21st.

He told her to go to Conkey Ave. to save lives &amp; she told him that they were killing people here too.&#160; She offered him some free baby clothes &amp; he responded back to her that he wasn't married but he takes care of his own child.&#160; So 'no' to the free clothes then.&#160; I took down his license number &amp; he didn't care in the least.&#160; I told him that he was parking in a 'No Parking' zone but again he didn't seem to really mind.&#160; He just wanted to bug us &amp; saw that we were not&#160;being bugged &amp; that bugged him.&#160; Oh well we can't please everyone!&#160; Later on we were bugged but not at this time, in our encounter with this man, that just didn't get it.&#160; He went for the camera again &amp; just sat there for a few more minutes starring.&#160; He finally left to go down the street &amp; Martha &amp; I were relieved by the lack of his bizarre presence.&#160; I was wrong.&#160; We looked down the street only to see that he was turning around &amp; had now parked in front of the vets, which was not opened for business.&#160; He got out of his car to put some money&#160;into the parking meter, good boy, &amp; then went back into&#160;his car to stare &amp; to take more pictures of us again.&#160; Poor guy, go to the park, or something.&#160; What was this all about?&#160; He did give us the creeps, for in all my 25 years in sidewalk counseling, I don't remember a stockier, there is a first time for everything.&#160; As I was figuring out what to do next I saw walking up the sidewalk a mother with her 6 young children coming towards us.&#160; I went&#160;over to her &amp; said "hello, Brittany" &amp; she said "hello Mary, we've come to do some work in the Material Aid Room for you".&#160; I said "that would be great" &amp; they all followed me into the room, to put some children's clothes away, that were&#160;still in boxes, from earlier today.&#160; I was most grateful for their presence &amp; assistance.&#160; I then went&#160;into the Taxi room to ask big Alan to show himself, out on the sidewalk, maybe&#160;so this guy will know that we really aren't alone &amp; to get out of Dodge quickly &amp; quietly.&#160; But no, not him, he didn't go anywhere but big Alan had to go back to work, answering the phone, at the Taxi company.&#160; Sorry Alan, to drag you into this scenario.&#160; I was now back with Martha &amp; we decided to ignore him for awhile &amp; to continue to pray &amp; to witness.&#160; I saw Dan, a pro life friend of Martha &amp; I, who was dropping off packages,&#160;to the printer store, up the street.&#160; I waved to him to come over to Martha &amp; I,&#160;and he did.&#160; He stopped &amp; I told him what was going on.&#160; He said that he was working &amp; that he would take a picture of him, on his cell phone.&#160; I said "that would be great Dan".&#160; He drove a little ways down the street &amp; stopped the van &amp; took this guys picture &amp; then left to go back to work.&#160;No big deal right.&#160;Wrong.&#160; Later on&#160;I found out that the guy called Dan's boss to report him for taking his picture &amp; Dan was called into the office where his boss chewed him out.&#160; Poor Dan, he was only helping us.

I said a prayer &amp; then about 5 minutes later a police drive down the street &amp; I went into the street to get the police officer to stop.&#160; He did.&#160; He pulled over &amp; got out of his car &amp; came over to Martha &amp; I.&#160; Martha explained the situation &amp; he said that he would go over to talk to him.&#160; Alleluia!!&#160; He got back into his car &amp; pulled in back of the sitting car with the weird man in it, &amp; got out &amp; walked over to the car.&#160; He spoke with this man for a few minutes.&#160; I saw that a woman walking out of the parking lot of Planned Parenthood with a brown bag in her hands.&#160; I said to her "please don't take the Morning After Pill", thinking that the bag could have this drug in it?&#160; She replied "I don't want anymore kids".&#160; I said quickly "please don't kill the little baby that could be in your womb now".&#160; Off she goes across the street &amp; into the car, of the guy who has been parked there, for over 50 minutes now.&#160; Who would know!!&#160; Martha &amp; I just looked at each other with a 'are you kidding look on our faces.&#160; See he was there to harass us for he should have been in the parking lot of the death mill, waiting for his, murder on her mind, girlfriend, &amp; not sitting in front of the vet's office, for what reason was to cause us anxiety.&#160; The police offer went over to the talk to the other police offer who now has joined him.&#160; The car then pulled away from the curb &amp; drove into Planned Parenthood &amp; I saw that&#160;he had a smirk on his devious face.&#160; As the car was coming out, a few minutes later, I said to&#160;him "please love the baby, who could be in her womb, as you love the baby in the back seat".&#160; Off they went into the world.&#160; Yeah!!&#160;

Martha was going to come a little later.&#160; As I was pulling into our parking lot &amp; noticed that Bill was standing across the street, of Planned Parenthood,&#160;with his signs &amp; that I needed to go over there to tell him that I would be out in awhile.&#160; The moment I arrived there&#160;was a young girl walking to the door of the center &amp; I asked she if I could help her.&#160; She said that she needed a pregnancy test &amp; I said to her "come follow me".&#160; I told her that I needed a few minutes to open up the doors &amp; to set up for the test.&#160; I asked her if she had any children &amp; she said that she had a 1 year old daughter so I said for her to go into the Material Aid Room to get some things for her child &amp; that I would be with her in a few minutes.&#160; As I was doing all this the doorbell rang &amp; it was a young girl asking for some children's clothes.&#160; I was hoping that Martha would come soon for I knew that Suzanne would be coming in about 20 minutes to counsel.&#160; I just prayed that I could do everything,&#160;for I was not feeling well at all.&#160; I was in much pain (chronic pain)which is difficult for me to minister but I pray that the good Lord will help me to help our clients, with love.&#160; I asked her how she knew about us &amp; she said that a friend recommended us to her.&#160; I take her to the Material Aid Room &amp; she &amp; the other girl who was in there getting some things spoke.&#160; Hi was the response to each other.&#160; Here was her friend that recommended us to her.&#160; I said "did&#160;she know that you were here"?&#160; She said "no".&#160; How quaint.&#160; Then said to the first girl that I was ready for her in the Rose Room to do the pregnancy test &amp; left her friend in the Material Aid Room to continue shopping.&#160; What was I suppose to do?&#160; We like to be in there, to assist our mothers, but that's not always possible, &amp; today was the day it was not possible.&#160; I did the test &amp; then counseled our young mother for awhile.&#160; When she left the Rose Room she went back to the Material Aid Room to continue her shopping.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again.&#160; I went to the door to see a young pregnant girl &amp; a guy standing at the door.&#160; I answered the door &amp; said "Samantha".&#160; She said "yes".&#160; "Welcome" I said to her &amp; her friend.&#160; She was the girl that had called me this week asking for baby clothes for her expected baby who is due in August.&#160; The Women's Care Center recommended us to her.&#160; I brought her to the Material Aid Room &amp; had to hurry the 2 other girls for they had time to shop &amp; had a couple of bags for their children already.&#160; I said for them to come back in the future, if they needed anything else, for their children.&#160; They said "okay &amp; thank you" &amp; left.&#160; I was really hoping that Martha would come soon &amp; my prayers were answered in a matter of a few minutes.&#160; Martha came into the room &amp; I greeted her &amp; then introduced her to our new clients. A few minutes after Martha arrived Suzanne arrived.&#160; I introduced her to our new clients &amp; then gave her some instructions of what I needed this afternoon for her to do.&#160; Simple things like ordering brochures &amp; pregnancy tests.&#160;I reviewed the week for her.&#160; I like it when Suzanne calls the clients, the pregnant ones &amp; the ones that have already delivered their babies.&#160; I don't want to take time away from her to do that important work.&#160; I then went back to the Material Aid Room to say good bye to the young couple &amp; told Martha that I was going to the front lines to be with Bill &amp; that I would see her soon.&#160; She said "okay, I'll be out later".&#160; Off I go with the mega phone &amp; picture of Malachi the sweet aborted baby picture &amp;&#160; the box of literature.&#160; I got to the bush side of Planned Parenthood to set up.&#160; I called over to Bill, for he is hard of hearing that I was on the sidewalk now.&#160; I looked over to the Planned Parenthood parking lot &amp; I didn't see the abortionist car parked by the back door.&#160; I was happy but you still can't let your guard down for there could be another abortionist taking her place in there.&#160; Martha joined me on the sidewalk after she was done ministering with our happy young couple.&#160; I hope to see them again, in the future.&#160; </strong></font></p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://images.clipartof.com/small/16218-School-Bus-Driver-Man-Driving-School-Children-To-Or-From-School-Clipart-Illustration-Image.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

We live in a 'throw away' society, if you don't want your baby you just kill he or she before he or she is born, no big deal to these cold hearted &amp; selfish people.&#160; I handed her the Bella movie, for we pass this movie out in tough cases &amp; also our DVD on a bloodless abortion &amp; the growth &amp; development, of the baby in the womb &amp; a testimony, of a former abortion mill owner, Carol Everett,&#160;who has now repented &amp; is saving&#160;lives, instead of taking lives.&#160; I then said to this young girl, for her to look me in the eye &amp; promise me to look at these 2 DVD's, that I just handed to her&#160;&amp; she looked me in the eye &amp; said "yes I will".&#160; She also took a Truth packet &amp; a rubberized 12 week old baby.&#160; Martha kept on talking to her &amp; we told her that we had a pregnancy center right next to the big yellow building &amp; if she needed anything for her&#160;just to call the number on the brochure that was handed to her.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; that she had to go to catch the bus &amp; then she walked up the street to Gibb's &amp; then turned the corner &amp; we saw her no more that day.&#160; Martha &amp; I consoled each other,&#160;from the pain that we were both experiencing, at that moment.&#160; It feels like someone is ripping our hearts out, you can't imagine it hurting so badly.&#160; We cry, we talk, we write, we pray, we&#160;scream, &amp; we have to give it to God, otherwise we will not be able to function &amp; to be ready for the next mother, who might 'chose life' for her sweet baby &amp; need our help.&#160; We must be 'whole' in order to 'help'.&#160;&#160;&#160;Not easy at all.&#160; There is no babies saved if there is no suffering first.&#160; We prayed that this girl would not have the abortion &amp; her baby will be saved from the abortionist cruel hands.</strong>&#160; </font></p><p><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.treehugger.com/yellow-school-bus-photo.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Martha was by her car that was parked on the street by the center &amp; I was coming out of the center &amp; I saw her talking to someone.&#160; I then recognized who she was.&#160; She was the young girl that Martha &amp; I spoke with on Tuesday, trying to save her precious baby from being killed, by abortion.&#160; I was just starting to talk to her when Martha hollered over to me "she did it, she had the abortion 2 days ago".&#160; My heart was sick &amp; I then said a few things to her, as she walked towards Gibbs St. &amp; around the corner she went.&#160; I feel in my heart that when Martha &amp; I was taking to her on Tuesday she had already started the abortion procedure which was RU 486 pills, to kill her baby.&#160; Evil never sleeps.&#160; She will never be the same again no matter how she tries &amp; I only hope &amp; pray that she asks the Lord, who created her &amp; died for her sins, to forgive her &amp; also her baby that she had killed.&#160; Lord have Mercy on her soul &amp; that of her boyfriend, who also will be judged for the murder, of this child of God.&#160; Martha &amp; I grieve for this baby &amp; all the babies that have been slaughtered by abortion.<br /><br />

I said "what"!&#160; She then said that she had tried to talk her out of it but she wouldn't listen.&#160; I said then why did you bring her?&#160; She said that she didn't drive her here that she came on her own.&#160; I told her to go in there &amp; talk to her again &amp; to give her this diagram of what the baby looks like &amp; I also gave her the rubberized 12 week old baby too.&#160; Then she said to Carol &amp; I "I have to walk my dog first".&#160; If you think that you have heard it all think again, I could hardly believe my hears when she said that.&#160; I said "put your dog in the car &amp; go in there &amp; try to save the life of your friends baby".&#160; "Go &amp; we will keep you in prayer, what is your first name", I asked.&#160; She turned around &amp; said "Jessica" &amp; left.&#160; I stopped for a moment, for I had named my precious baby girl twin Jessica Rose, that I lost from a miscarriage from the gang rape at Strong Memorial Hospital back in 1971.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; I named my precious boy twin Aaron Joseph, whom I lost in that miscarriage too.&#160; I think of them often but know that they are with God &amp; I will see them someday after I die &amp; be with them for all eternity.&#160; The mothers who abort their children might not&#160;be with their&#160;children, if they don't repent.&#160;&#160;I had to go into the center for a minute &amp; when I came out Carol told me that Jessica never went in &amp; she heard her talking to another girl who was at Planned Parenthood saying "they thought I was going to go in there but I couldn't".&#160; I said where is she now &amp; Carol told me that she was walking her dog .&#160;

I today.&#160; We got out to the front lines around 1:15pm.&#160; We set up on the sidewalk&#160; with the signs &amp; the literature box &amp; mega phone, to sidewalk counsel.&#160; Around 2pm I went into the center to make a chicken sandwich for both Martha &amp; I &amp; took&#160;the sandwiches &amp; cans of lemonade outside, to the from lines. &#160;I decided to eat first &amp; quickly,&#160;then I saw that one of our clients was walking up the sidewalk, she was coming to get the high chair that was given to us by Kelly&#160;that was&#160;dropped off earlier in the afternoon&#160;by Mary S..&#160; The high chair was new &amp; beautiful.&#160; I put the half eaten sandwich down &amp; took our client into the center to give her the high chair &amp; some diapers &amp; other things that she needed for her children.&#160; Just then I heard Martha calling to me at the door saying that a young girl was so upset&#160;&amp;&#160;if I could talk to her.&#160; She was crying &amp; looked real upset so I brought her into the Rose Room to see if I could help her.&#160; She said that she just find out that she was pregnant &amp; was undecided about having an abortion.&#160; She is new to Rochester &amp; is already in a 'program' for a problem that she didn't elaborate on.&#160; The father is a not a nice guy &amp; it was a rebound.&#160; She recently broke up with her boyfriend &amp; he doesn't know&#160;about her one night stand &amp; he was unfaithful too.&#160; They are back together again.&#160; No matter what the situation &amp; how bad it is, abortion is taking the life of a innocent human being &amp; is not acceptable in the eyes of God.&#160; It is always evil.&#160; The situations can change &amp; if they don't you still can't take a life.&#160; I hope with her for 45 minutes &amp; gave her a lot of brochures &amp;&#160;our DVD &amp; the Bella movie.&#160; Also, I gave her the rubberized 12 week old baby.&#160; We saw the Growth&#160; Development DVD in the Rose Room together &amp; at the end of the video she started to smile &amp; look so much better.&#160; I gave her my home &amp; cell phone number &amp; told her that Suzanne &amp; will be calling her to see how she is doing &amp; if she needed anything along the way, in her pregnancy.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; told her that she was not alone &amp; for her to fall in love with her baby that she is carrying.&#160; I also said that once you conceive you will always be the child's mother.&#160; Motherhood starts at conception not at birth.&#160; She left lighter &amp; brighter than when she first came in.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that she will stay strong &amp; not give in to the evil of abortion.&#160; We will keep in touch with her as we do with all of our moms.&#160;I had to re group before I went back to the front lines,&#160;for my emotions were wired, for this was a life &amp; death situation.&#160; I prayed for wisdom from the Holy Spirit to guide me when talking to her.&#160; His grace is sufficient.&#160; Thank you Lord for being with us in the Rose Room.&#160; All is well with my soul.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.skyscanner.com/news/articles/2009/12/03/angry.person.JPG"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I got the camera &amp; took her&#160;two pictures of her then I went to take a picture of the boyfriend &amp; he turned around fast &amp; slugged my arm &amp; the camera dropped to the ground but didn't break, thank God.&#160; &#160;I had already snapped his picture before he did that to my arm.&#160; Gotcha!&#160; Smile &amp; say "arrest'.&#160; Carole, was in the street, trying to get the&#160;boy on the bike&#160;to stop&#160;weaving in &amp;

He started to see what we were all about as the cars were pulling into Planned Parenthood.&#160; It all came together for him.&#160; Then he said something that was very sad.&#160; He said that his friend gave her baby up 16 years ago &amp; was wondering where she was &amp; what was she doing, especially during this time of year as school comes to a close.&#160; She expressed to him that she thought that it would have been better if she had aborted her daughter so that she would know where she was now rather than wondering if she was okay.&#160; Talk about confused.&#160; He did say to her that she needed to see a Psychiatrist &amp; maybe she does.&#160; I said to him "go tell her that&#160;her daughter would rather be in this world right now rather than be dead, no less killed by her mother,&#160;by abortion".&#160; How twisted is her thinking.&#160; You did the right thing by giving her up for adoption &amp; your daughter is more than grateful that you did put her up for adoption rather than abort her.&#160; Oh yea!!&#160; &#160;He stayed to talk to us for a little while longer &amp; I gave him a Truth packet which he first refused but insisted that he take it, which he did.&#160; He also mentioned that another friend of his is a real good person but she has a 'child from a dark place'.&#160; The boy has attacked his mom &amp; was kicked out of private school after 6 months &amp; now resides at Hillside Children's Center, where the abortionist Rachael Phelps once worked, go figure!&#160; The rational was that this child should have been aborted perhaps, only in jest did he say this, which I don't think funny.&#160; A life is created by God &amp; must be protected.&#160; I said we must not play God even though this kid is all messed up, he still is a child of God.&#160; I said that this boy needs lots of prayer.&#160; Hint, hint.&#160; He said good bye &amp; I said that I hoped to see him again sometime.&#160; He said that he would drop by again to talk to us again. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/62572/62572,1207517256,13/stock-photo-a-young-woman-with-red-hair-pulling-her-knees-to-her-chest-and-her-head-down-wearing-cut-off-jeans-11212717.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

The center gives out baby clothes, nursery items, books and small toys, diapers and baby wipes, formula, baby cereal and jars of food, and nonperishable food from the food shelf. The center also accepts such larger items as strollers, high chairs, bassinets, cribs and car seats, as long as they have not been recalled.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The nonprofit center survives on the financial and material donations of a network of supporters, many who are informed through e-mail of its news and needs.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"When I say, 'I need a stroller,' or, 'I need a double stroller,' I get a response," Jost said.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Pregnant women who visit the center often leave with their arms full of pamphlets, DVDs and baby items. The center also collaborates with other area pregnancy centers; for instance, it sends young women to another center for ultrasounds.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The center’s vice president and codirector, Martha Malone, recalls helping to convince a young woman not to go through with an abortion by reciting a powerful poem.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"It was the Holy Spirit," Malone said of why she was able to help the young woman.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The pregnancy center informally keeps track of how many women tell them they have decided not to abort — they say they know of at least 36 babies. They also make follow-up calls to see if the new moms and mothers-to-be have all the items they need. The goal is to help women realize that there are alternatives to abortion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"They are desperate, and no one reaches out," said Malone, a parishioner of St. Theodore in Gates.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Jost and Malone love to tell about the babies born to their clients.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"They are in our hearts," Jost said.

I greeted her when she came into the center &amp; then I brought her into the Rose Room. She told me that she had 5 children &amp; didn't want anymore. &#160;I prayed to the Holy Spirit for wisdom &amp; then&#160;preceded&#160;to counsel her &amp; to show her the Growth &amp; Development chart &amp; put on the DVD showing the baby in the womb. I&#160;talked&#160;to her about adoption &amp; gave her some brochures about that route to take. &#160;I had my head turned to the literature table to get more information for her when I heard her say "I'm not going to do it". &#160;I turned around &amp; gave her a hug &amp; talked to her some more. &#160;Then I went &amp; got her cousin who was shopping in the Material Aid Room for clothes for her children. &#160;Then our client went into the Material Aid Room &amp; picked up so many&#160;nice&#160;things for her children too. &#160;What a happy moment. &#160;Lots of love flowed in that room at that moment. &#160;It just didn't stop with her it went on &amp; on &amp; on. &#160;My head was spinning but in a good way. &#160;Please pray for baby # 5 for we think that the mom will not go through with the abortion, for her friend was supportive of life &amp; we gave the mom&#160;loads&#160;of information &amp; Martha talked to her that abortion is taking a life. She was too far long to have an abortion at Planned Parenthood today, so was referred to Strong Hospital for a 2nd. trimester abortion. &#160;I did take her ultrasound picture &amp; made a copy, in the center, of this&#160;sweet&#160;baby who is in her womb.</font></strong></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">The other clients who 'chose life' today are scared &amp; I told them that we will be with them to assist them with&#160;their&#160;needs during&#160;their&#160;pregnancy &amp; that they are not alone. They were relieved &amp; smiled. Seeing the reality of the graphic signs, out there on the sidewalk, makes our moms think &amp; then seeing the Growth &amp; Development chart also makes them think. &#160;"You shall know the truth &amp; the Truth will set you free". &#160;We just show them the truth &amp; let the Holy Spirit do the rest.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.gpsmagazine.com/assets/shirts_luv_dad_close.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

&#160; I continued "you have twisted thinking, once a baby is conceived then the baby has a right to life, you don't kill the baby you let the baby be born".&#160; I do try not to call names but sometimes I fail.&#160; As she was driving away, I did call her a 'nut case', to myself.&#160; How sick &amp; sad all in one breathe.&#160; I stayed a little while longer for I wanted to go to Confession before Mass today.&#160; I'll be back at 1pm to war again &amp; to hear some of the most craziest things one can ever imagine.</font></strong>&#160; </font></p></font><p><strong><font size="4">I am always apprehensive when Martha is not there with me on the front lines but she had family to visit in Pennsylvania &amp; the Thousand Islands, lucky her.&#160; I knew that Suzanne was, in the center today, &amp; that made me feel better.&#160; When I arrived after Mass there was our 81 year old war veteran Bill, already on the sidewalk with his sign,&#160;across the street from the Killing Mill Planned Parenthood, he's there from 12:30-3pm faithfully.&#160; I was knew that Melody &amp; Jerry were going to be there also so it was just a matter of time that we would have more people on the sidewalk witnessing the Truth.&#160; I saw that the abortionist was there so I hurried to get the signs, mega phone &amp; literature box, to go out to the front lines,&#160;as fast as I could.&#160; Just then Suzanne had arrived &amp; was carrying a bed rail &amp; a walker for a toddler &amp; her lunch.&#160; Hands full I opened the door for her &amp; greeted her.&#160; I&#160;was glad that she had arrived at 1pm today instead of 1:30pm.&#160; God is Good.&#160; I spoke to her briefly &amp; then went out to the 'war zone' where they murder innocent, defenseless Americans frequently for money &amp; convince.&#160;</font></strong></p><div><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://blog.kir.com/archives/images/man%20in%20PrisonBars.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="88" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:bo0j_pl8VNyB0M:http://blog.kir.com/archives/images/man%20in%20PrisonBars.jpg" /></a></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;A few minutes later Melody showed up &amp; I greeted her.&#160; Just then a man pushing, a young boy in a stroller, came from behind the bushes.&#160; I said to him that we had children's clothes in the center right next to this yellow building for your son.&#160; I then asked him what he was doing at Planned Parenthood.&#160; He said "she's on there".&#160; I said"what is she in there for"?&#160; Then he said "it's not my kid".&#160; Oh my God!&#160; I said for him to back in there to try to save the baby's life &amp; he said that she was already in the back room.&#160; I said that you are letting this baby die.&#160; "It's not my kid".&#160; So what if he or she isn't your baby, this child shouldn't have to be killed, for Heaven's sake!&#160; He just walked away going for a nice walk on a mellow summer's day.&#160; Get real mister this is the worst day of your life &amp; you don't even know it.&#160; When he came back from he's walk, about 45 minutes later,&#160;I told him that he &amp; his girlfriend will suffer.&#160; He quickly responded that he's already suffered, for he just got out of jail, yesterday.&#160; Well sir, you just went back into the hole today &amp; this time it is for the rest of your life, until you repent.&#160; I always mention,&#160;the Forgiveness &amp; Mercy of Almighty God, for a person that repents, of his or her sins.&#160; Lord have Mercy on their souls,&#160;for this murder today.&#160; I told them, as they were driving out of the parking lot about 15 minutes later, to repent for the sin of murder.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that&#160;they will &amp; not put it off either, for the Lord said in His Word "now is the acceptable time".&#160; The poor little boy, who was about 2 years old, will also&#160;be effected by this terrible day.&#160;&#160; Melody &amp; I were very sad &amp; she also tried to talk to him but he had the 'spirit of murder' with him &amp; he wouldn't listen.&#160; &#160;This little baby was probably conceived by another man while he was in&#160;jail &amp; when he got out he made sure that this little precious baby was going to suffer for the betrayal of the mother.&#160; It's easier to kill someone that can't fight back, you big bully, with a shirt on with a huge&#160;skull on it.&#160;Ick!

I knew that she had taken the packet to comfort herself for the abortion of her grand child, but did she ever look into them for healing.&#160; I gently took the packet out of her hands &amp; opened it up to where the phone numbers of Project Rachel &amp;

I couldn't understand what she said, for she had an accent, so I said to her again&#160;to ask God to forgive her for her part in the abortion&#160;&amp; He will, I said.&#160; She shook her head ,as if to understand now.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; she was on her way, maybe a little better, than before.&#160; All these years passed by before we got to the 'root of the problem',&#160;maybe because today she was willing to share her story, for the first time.&#160;

that she was back there to see how far long she was.&#160; Why dear William would you go back to a place that was willing to kill your precious baby last week?&#160; He said because Planned Parenthood was close by to where they lived.&#160;

He came back later after his walk &amp; went with his daughter back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; We were afraid that the girlfriend was having an abortion &amp; not letting William know.&#160; That would break his heart &amp; ours.&#160; They came walking out a couple of hours later with her baby still in her womb.&#160; Thank God!&#160; He did say that Planned Parenthood told her that if she wanted the fetus to be sucked out of her then she can come back on Thursday.&#160;

She came back to the room where everyone was&#160;&amp; we all had a great time&#160;of sharing &amp; just being together as a family of pro life friends.&#160; After supper Martha had to go to a Financial Committee Meeting at her parish.&#160; We had desert, which was one of the best lemon meringue pies that I ever had.&#160; Thanks Jane't mmmmmm good!!&#160; Then the intense personal sharing took place.&#160; I won't go into any detail, because of privacy reasons, but it was certainly intense to say the least.&#160; What people go through, in this life!!&#160;&#160;Lord have Mercy!&#160; Good news, at the end of the evening,&#160;was that Betty, our new friend,&#160;was going to join our team, in the center &amp; out on the front lines, three times a week along with Martha &amp; I.&#160; Praise God!!!&#160; We prayed then all said good bye.&#160; I had things to do, after everyone had left, then went home.&#160; Much to process today, very intense.&#160; I was not myself, at the start of this evening&#160;&amp; was in a grumpy mood too&#160;but things turned around for me &amp; I especially thank God &amp; Pastor Jane't.&#160;

Century but he refused.&#160; Just then a carload of Planned Parenthood workers pulled out of Planned Parenthood &amp; stopped at the exit &amp; the one woman pulled down the car window &amp; started to talk to the city worker.&#160; When they left I told him that they were workers of death.&#160; He said that they were doctors.&#160; I said "no they were not, don't let them tickle your ear".&#160; We tried to educate this man.&#160;

God doesn't understand the murdering of His creation.&#160; This is the first time I heard such nonsense.&#160; I tried to talk to her some more after she filled out the Intake Sheet.&#160; Then she said "am I free to go".&#160; I said "you were always free to go for we don't hold anyone prisoner here but before you go why don't you come with me to the Material Aid Room to get some things for your 2 year old daughter".&#160; She said "fine".&#160; When she came into the room she said that her daughter had so much already &amp; that she didn't need anything else.&#160; I went over to get something quick for her little baby in her womb, to bond.&#160;

No one knows the pain that we are in when babies are being killed there at Planned Parenthood, ONLY the ones who are out on the front lines know how much it hurts.&#160; I'm not saying that other people don't suffer when they hear of the atrocities of abortion but no one knows the true feeling of loss&#160;when they are killing these precious babies about 100 feet away from where&#160;we are standing &amp; calling out to their mothers &amp; fathers, relatives &amp; friends not to do it &amp; they do it anyway.&#160; The team tried to comfort each other the best way we could but the grieving takes time.&#160; Trust me, it will take a lot of time, some of us are still grieving the losses of last year too.&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://images.clipartof.com/small/16218-School-Bus-Driver-Man-Driving-School-Children-To-Or-From-School-Clipart-Illustration-Image.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="97" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Ne-4yeEMUB49NM:http://images.clipartof.com/small/16218-School-Bus-Driver-Man-Driving-School-Children-To-Or-From-School-Clipart-Illustration-Image.jpg" /></a></font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">Martha had to go to baby- sit but she will be back later on&#160;for supper &amp; work in the center.&#160; The school bus went passed us &amp; gave a long honk, with his&#160;thumb up.&#160; He's our buddy &amp; a breathe of fresh air to us, who are&#160;out on the sidewalk, dealing with 'baby murdering', three&#160;days, of&#160;every week of the year.&#160; His kids on the bus wave at us too.&#160; Just then a kid on a bicycle rode pass me &amp; gave me his IQ,&#160;which is his middle finger, I was glad that Carole had to go into the center for a few minutes to get some water otherwise his finger might fall off too.&#160; It's so discouraging, at times, to think that there are so many evil &amp; misguided people walking around,&#160;but we must keep our hearts &amp; minds&#160;on Jesus, who has conquered death, on the Cross.&#160; There will be a Judgment Day, for all of us &amp; I want to be ready &amp; I hope that others want to be ready for that day too, for we don't know when it will be.&#160; "Now is the acceptable time", thus says the Lord.&#160; That's why I stress the word "repentance" out on the front lines so much.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://chawnghilh.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/praying-hands.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="68" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:3VdFfTZWlR46YM:http://chawnghilh.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/praying-hands.jpg" /></a></font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">Another young girl went into the center for a pregnancy test &amp; Suzanne greeted her.&#160; Melody &amp; her friend were kept busy making up Truth packets &amp; brought them out to the girls on the sidewalk, to give away.&#160; After this young girl came out of the center Betty was walking into the center so I asked if Betty would pray with her in the parking lot for a few minutes.&#160; She happily did so.&#160; Later on Betty told me that she wanted her to pray for a baby &amp; Betty asked if she was married &amp; the young girl said "no" that she wasn't married, so Betty being a good Christian, told her that she could,'t pray for that because she wasn't married.&#160; You don't pray to God, to commit a sin, to get what you want &amp; that's what sex outside of marriage is.&#160; ex outside of marriage is fornication &amp; is a 'Serious Sin' called a 'Deadly Sin' or 'Mortal Sin' that if not confessed, can land you in Hell, for all Eternity.&#160; 'No Organisms in Hell'.&#160; Non martial sex is not worth going to Hell for. </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://chamberofsecrets89.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/anger.gif"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="81" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:zUjI6nW9J2ZWeM:http://chamberofsecrets89.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/anger.gif" /></a></font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">As I was walking back to the front lines, there came out of Planned Parenthood, William &amp; his girlfriend &amp; young daughter, in the stroller.&#160; They were walking up the street towards E.

The&#160;offense was that I followed them ,as they were walking up the street, after they left Planned Parenthood.&#160; I got out of the car &amp; he said&#160; "are you running away"?&#160; "No" I said, I'm just going over here to sit &amp; to wait for the police to come.&#160; "I'd go to jail for your baby, if I have to", I said. &#160;Then he hollered to the people standing outside of the Enterprise building, across the street,&#160;saying "what are you looking at".&#160; The girlfriend told him to remember that he was on probation &amp; he told her to "shut up", where did the love go?&#160; "I don't care" was his response".&#160;&#160;He looked at me with such rage &amp; said "I bet that you're not married or have any children &amp; are lonely, lonely, lonley".&#160; I replied back saying to him "William you have the Rosary that we gave you around your neck".&#160; He froze on the spot.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.howtobecomesomething.com/images/how-to-become-a-police-officer.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

started to ask me questions.&#160; William told the officer that he was the one that called him &amp; not me.&#160; So the officer asked him what this was all about.&#160; William replied that I was following him from down the street.&#160; I looked on the officer's face, he didn't know to process this one.&#160; "What", he said, &#160;"that's not illegal&#160;to follow some one up the street".&#160; Just then another police officer came by on his bicycle &amp; two other officers, in their cars.&#160; I looked at the officer &amp; said "hello officer Chris".&#160; "Hello Mary" was the reply.&#160; Then the other officer told William &amp; the woman to go on their way &amp; off they went.&#160; Officer Chris didn't admonish me, in my decision to confront William, with the question that I had asked him. &#160;I told Chris what&#160;they had done at Planned Parenthood &amp;&#160;he said "another member less in that family", I said "yes".&#160;&#160; I started to cry &amp; he told me to go back to the center &amp; try to relax.&#160; I said that now I have to tell the team that William's girlfriend, did have the abortion, for there wasn't any second guessing any longer.&#160; I said "thank you officer Chris" &amp; I thanked the other police officers&#160;&#160;too.&#160; One of the people from across the street said that they called the police for me, for they saw that he was blocking me, in the driveway.&#160; I said "thank you, I appreciate that&#160;&amp; have a great day" &amp; off I went back to the center to tell everyone the bad news.&#160; This loss is going to take awhile to heal, for me &amp; for the team.&#160; It became so personal because we had engaged William so many times &amp; bonded with him, in the fight to save his baby's life, only for him to give in to this evil of murder, of his little one.&#160; How do I process this dear Lord?&#160; I did go to Confession,&#160;the next day,&#160;&amp; in that Sacrament I did ask the Lord to forgive me for stopping my car, in the middle of the street, &#160;that was dangerous &amp; I could have caused an accident &amp; could have hurt or even had killed someone, by my rash judgment to follow William, up the street.&#160; Lord have&#160;Mercy on my soul.&#160; God forgives, I wish people would.&#160;

Martha was talking to her now while I went over to the literature box to get a Truth packet &amp; a rubberized baby at 12 weeks &amp; our DVD &amp; our brochure &amp; the doctors list &amp; another Rosary.&#160; I got these things in less than 10 seconds, for&#160;I didn't want her to drive away without them.&#160; I handed all the information to the passenger, in the car,&#160;&amp; then begged&#160;the woman who was driving that&#160;said that she was going to&#160;have an abortion,&#160;not to have her baby killed.&#160; The woman said that she has 3 children &amp; Martha told her that she had 5 children &amp; it didn't kill her.&#160; She asked me if she had my contact information &amp; I pointed to my name &amp; phone # in the brochure.&#160;

to see if Melody &amp; Dominique needed anything.&#160;I also got the lunch bag for Martha &amp; I.&#160; We start to feel faint around this time of day.&#160; When I got back outside I saw that Martha was talking to a young man with many tattoos on his arms.&#160; I got involved with the conversation.&#160; It sounded like his girlfriend was in Planned Parenthood having an abortion &amp; he wasn't sure if it was his.&#160; I said that doesn't make any difference but he said that it was to late for she has been there for a long time &#160;now.&#160; I then said to him that it was sad that he drove her in here to do this&#160;terrible thing.&#160; He looked at me &amp; said that he was to young to drive.&#160;&#160;What!!&#160; &#160;He then asked us if we had a cigarette.&#160; "No" was our reply.&#160; Are you kidding!!&#160; Martha was trying to give him post abortion literature but I didn't feel comfortable with that.&#160; I said "do you believe in God"? &#160;He said "I believe in God" then he rolled up his sleeve &amp; showed us his tattoo, of a cross.&#160; This is not happening!!&#160; I said to him that this&#160;was a sad day for&#160;him &amp;&#160;his girlfriend &amp; then he walked back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Carole hollered over to us, from across the street, that he had been talking to the Death Escort, for a very long time, when he came over to talk Martha.&#160; What a messed up kid.&#160; A few minutes later he &amp; his girlfriend came out &amp; they went to their car.&#160; They stood there in the parking lot, next to their car, for a few minutes, while I ranted &amp; raved to them what she just had just done. &#160;I saw that they both had a smile on their faces &amp; then I saw that they were walking towards Martha &amp; I, on the sidewalk.&#160; They came around the bushes &amp; there they were in front of Martha &amp; I.&#160; She saw the graphic sign, of the aborted baby, &amp; said "how sad was that picture".&#160; I said "did you do that to your baby here today"?&#160; She was hesitant but then said "no".&#160; Martha asked if she was pregnant &amp;, as she was smoking her cigarette, she replied "yes".&#160;&#160;Finally we got some truth here, no more&#160;'Game Playing'&#160;I hope.&#160; I looked over to the young man &amp; said that I forgave him for what he was pulling on us &amp; that it wasn't very funny but sick.&#160; I then asked her why was she there.&#160; She said that she was there to see how far long she was.&#160; That could be good or bad.&#160; Sometimes they want to know,&#160;so they can&#160;have an abortion, &amp; then other times they just want to know how far along they are.&#160; I suggested that they go to Compass Care, for an ultrasound,&#160;&amp; for them to help her to&#160;stop&#160;smoking. too.&#160; I asked if she would like&#160;me to make the initial call &amp; then I would give her the phone to make the appointment.&#160; She agreed.&#160; I called Compass Care &amp; told them who I was &amp; that I had a young girl that would like to make an appointment, for an ultrasound.&#160; She took the phone &amp; made the appointment, for the next day.&#160; After she hung up she said that she was going back into Planned Parenthood to cancel the appointment, for the ultrasound, today.&#160; Martha &amp; I encouraged her to just go home &amp; that she didn't need to go back into Planned Parenthood to cancel the appointment or just call them on your way home.&#160; But she insisted that she wanted to go back in to cancel the appointment.&#160; I said that they sell abortions to young girls who are afraid &amp; vulnerable but they went back in there anyway.&#160; I hope that she's not playing games with us too.&#160; We noticed that they didn't come out until about an half an hour later.&#160; As they were driving away, for she was the one driving, I asked her if she was going to keep her appointment tomorrow &amp; she nodded back to me "yes".&#160; We hope &amp; pray that she does, for her &amp; her baby's sake.&#160; What a mixed up boy &amp; girl.&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://treesflowersbirds.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/rain.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

When I got there Betty was there waiting for me.&#160; She had been there for an hour, she 's new, so I said that I get there at 1pm.&#160; She said "no problem".&#160; Dominique wasn't there yet so I had to wonder if she would come back to us.&#160; Well, about an hour later the phone rang,&#160;it was her &amp; she said that her doctor had put her on disability &amp; that she wasn't coming back, for the 20 hours per week, but that she would come back next week to help out for a few hours.&#160; Great, for we need you.&#160; Disappointment is what I experience every week.&#160; When I get excited that I will be getting the help that I need in the center, something happens that people either call to cancel or tell me that they can't make it that day.&#160; It's so hard for me.&#160; I feel like I've been punched in the gut.&#160; I have to give it to the Lord &amp; know in my heart that He is watching over the ministry &amp; will provide the help that I&#160;need, for the job, that He wants accomplished that day.&#160;

called over, across the street, to a young girl that was walking down the sidewalk, that we had free pregnancy tests &amp; baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; As&#160;I was calling over to her, a Planned Parenthood worker was walking down the sidewalk, in front of me, smirking.&#160;

</strong></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>The doorbell rang &amp; I went to answer it &amp; asked Maria if she would do a pregnancy test.&#160; She was orientated last week in the refresher course.&#160;

Just new policy.&#160; Probably 100% will say "yes".&#160; We just want to be more professional &amp; respectful of our clients privacy.&#160; I heard some crying, as I was in the office at that time.&#160; I knew that the client was pregnant.&#160; I later found out that it was the girlfriend that was crying, to the good news, of her girlfriend.&#160; Then the client was crying due to the fact that she will have to face her Aunt, who she is living with.&#160; We offered her that we would go,&#160;to be with her as she tells her Aunt, if she wants one of us to.&#160; We will do whatever it takes to save a life.&#160; I went into the Rose Room to offer my assistance &amp; gave her some support &amp; a DVD &amp; some brochures on Adoption &amp; care of her baby.&#160; After things settled down a bit we went into the Material Aid Room to get something for her to bond with her baby, who is alive &amp; in her womb.&#160; We will follow up on this client as we do our other clients weekly, through Suzanne, who is our Thursday afternoon counselor, who tries to get through the files to see how our clients are doing &amp;

Later on she came back with a car seat stating, that then when she came home, there it was on her porch, so she thought that we could use it.&#160; Thanks so much, that was so nice of you dear one.&#160;

for her to come on in.&#160; She was there in a few minutes for she had gone to Planned Parenthood &amp; they were not taking in walk ins &amp; she saw our&#160;sign out on the sidewalk &amp; called.&#160; &#160;I brought her into the Rose Room for a pregnancy test &amp; it was positive.&#160; She was surprised &amp; told&#160;me her story.&#160; It's usually complicated &amp; that saddens me so much.&#160; When you have sex your chances of getting pregnant&#160;is there because that's how you get a baby is through sex.&#160; So many girls have sex &amp; don't think that they could get pregnant.&#160; Most of the guys are not around or are&#160;incarcerated &amp; if they get out &amp; find that the baby isn't theirs they force her to have an abortion, which is murder.&#160; They leave her anyway &amp; then she suffers from Post Abortion Stress Syndrome that no one talks about especially Planned Parenthood, which is bad for business, &amp; the modern medical world who makes $$$ off of the abortion, through doctor visits &amp; the pharmaceutical companies, for the anti depressants that the doctors prescribes for her depression &amp; anxiety.&#160;&#160;It goes full circle &amp; the girl is usually the victim of all of this.&#160; My heart goes out &amp; we try, at the center, to make her aware of this cycle &amp; to get Post Abortion help for forgiveness &amp; healing.&#160; &#160;She has a child &amp; is post abortive &amp; her boyfriend is in jail &amp; this is her friends baby.&#160; So to say the least I had a lot to teach &amp; information to give her.&#160; Betty was invited to come in at the end to pray with her &amp; to show her some love &amp; support. We then brought her tot the Material Aid Room to get some things for her child at home.&#160; She called a friend to get a ride home but that didn't work out so I drove her home &amp; Betty kept me company.&#160;

She then said that the woman that I spoke to last Friday aborted &amp; she wasn't sure if it was on Thursday or Friday, of&#160;last week.&#160; I know that it wasn't&#160;last week&#160;because she was pregnant when I met her &amp;

after that I decided to go to the center to do some work there.&#160; I arrived around 3:10 pm &amp; after awhile in the center I decided to go outside to Planned Parenthood to see how many cars were in the parking lot.&#160; When I arrived I saw that the abortionist wasn't there but there were 2 people talking, a man &amp; a woman, in the parking lot.&#160; I called them over to me &amp; they came.&#160; I spoke to them for a few minutes &amp; then offered them some literature &amp; invited them to come with me to the center to get them.&#160; They followed me into the Focus Center.&#160; I again spoke with them about many things.&#160; She was nice &amp; seemed to be a Christian &amp; he gave me a hard time with many questions about Christianity, which I answered through the power of the Holy&#160;Spirit.&#160; She became irritated with him saying "What, you don't know that Jesus is the&#160;son of God"!!&#160; I asked her what she was doing at Planned Parenthood &amp; she said for pre natal care.&#160; I told&#160;them about their Racism &amp; gave&#160;them&#160;the Truth packet &amp; the DVD on Growth &amp; Development &amp; Maafa 21: Black Genocide in the 21st. Century.&#160; Also our 12 week old rubberized baby &amp; our list of good doctors to&#160;go to.&#160; I invited them into the Material Aid Room to get some green &amp; yellow&#160;baby clothes &amp; she showed me her bulging belly at that point.&#160; At the end of&#160;our time together I&#160;asked if they had a Bible.&#160; He said that he has a Koran &amp; she said that she would&#160;like a Bible so I went into the Rose Room to get one for her.&#160; On the way out I asked her to write down her name &amp; phone number on the Intake Sheet &amp; if it was okay with her, that&#160;Suzanne our counselor, would call&#160;her to see if&#160;she &#160;needed anything.&#160; "That's fine" she answered back.&#160; As&#160;the boyfriend&#160;was leaving he&#160;turned around to me &amp; said that he was a Muslim.&#160; "Okay" I said back &amp; have a nice day.&#160; He earlier stated that he believed in Science &amp; not Religion &amp; said&#160;many weird things.&#160; I asked her if he was her husband or boyfriend&#160; &amp; she said "boyfriend".&#160; He watched to many bad movies like the Di Vinci Code &amp; I told him that.&#160; Needless&#160;to say I was very surprised to hear that she had an abortion.&#160; When Suzanne called her she thought that it was Planned Parenthood &amp; said that she was still bleeding.&#160; Suzanne handled the phone call very well.&#160; This, like&#160;all our lost babies, was a heart break.&#160;&#160;I pondered this over &amp; over in my head.&#160; It was to late, last Friday &amp; the&#160;abortionist wasn't there &amp; she&#160;looked pregnant, so why in the name of Heaven did she&#160;come back on probably Tuesday, to have an abortion,&#160;when she wasn't even abortion minded, on Friday???&#160; Only God knows what happened to have someone do this terrible act of violence against another human being, especially one's own child, that God so fearfully &amp; wonderfully created.&#160; I was sick &amp; puzzled, to boot about this, or hearing the news of any precious, innocent baby being killed.&#160; <a id="thumbnail" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/3050575269_9a260e8a0b.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="58" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ehD5afld6w2QKM:http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/3050575269_9a260e8a0b.jpg" /></a></font></font></strong></p></div><font color="#000000"><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><strong>I went&#160;back to the front lines carrying this pain with me.&#160; Martha told me that 3 young girls were heading towards Planned Parenthood &amp; were informed about the Truth.&#160; The two girls, out of the three, did not go into Planned Parenthood to get anything but the hard noised one did.&#160; &#160;When she came out she showed Martha &amp; Carole &amp; Betty her condoms.&#160; Oh what a catch!&#160; You'll be the only one with a sexually transmitted disease or get pregnant &amp; what, come back here to the people that care for you (not), &amp; have them kill your sweet baby.&#160; Hope not with all&#160;our hearts.&#160; Some of our girls are soooo hard but we love them never the less only to worry about them, a little more than the others.&#160; We wouldn't be out there taking so much disappointment &amp; hatred &amp; chaos if we didn't love them &amp; their children but especially the dearly offended Lord &amp; Savior.&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://wordincarnate.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/silhouette-of-woman-praying.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 63px; float: left; height: 82px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="59" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:9O-fF5WIRfG6gM:http://wordincarnate.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/silhouette-of-woman-praying.jpg" /></a></strong></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>We came in around 5pm to set up for supper &amp; then went to <img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 53px; float: left; height: 59px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="62" height="80" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Zflq7KDBJOKKNM:http://fancyflours.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/ice-cream-cone.jpg" />Strong to visit our dear friend.&#160; Thank God that I had my 3 friends with me, for I was near the very building that, the gang rape took place back in 1971, at Strong Memorial Hospital.&#160; It was&#160;in the Research Center.&#160; They gave me their love &amp; support &amp; prayers,&#160;after the visit of our friend,&#160;in the Abbots parking lot&#160;on Mt.

When I first arrived, one of the seasoned pro lifers, was already there.&#160; He came out of the center to tell me that we already had a client that was in the Material Aid Room getting things for her child.&#160; I walked into the room &amp; said "hello".&#160; I knew that Martha was right behind me for we came to the center right after Mass &amp; I saw her park her car on the street, where she won't get hit.&#160; I went into the office &amp; I saw that&#160;the red light was blinking, on the phone, which means that I had a &#160;message.&#160; I knew also that the other pro lifer was going to get things set up on the sidewalk &amp; would sidewalk counsel, so I didn't have to worry about the coverage on the front lines &amp; also I knew that Mary S. &amp; Donna come at this time &amp; would be with him on the sidewalk, as Martha &amp; I would be in the center, for awhile.&#160; &#160;I took the phone message &amp; it was Sandy, calling in today, for she wasn't feeling well.&#160; Sorry to hear that.&#160; We are short one person now.&#160; Just then my cell phone went off &amp; it was Betty saying that she was a patient at the Strong Hospital.&#160; What next, I'm afraid to pick up any more phones.&#160; She had a non life threatening health problem &amp; will be home on Friday, thank God,&#160;&amp; will be back at the center next Tuesday.&#160; That sounds good to me Betty.&#160; She requested to stay in the center &amp; not to go outside on the front lines.&#160; Understandable.&#160; I know was in the hallway &amp; heard the doorbell so I went to answer it as I passed the Material Aid Room I saw that Martha was in the room helping our mom, which I knew that she would.&#160; We have this quiet understanding with each other.&#160; I went to the door &amp; there was our client that "Chose Life".&#160; I said "hi dear one it is so good to see you, I thought that you said that you were coming in on Thursday but that's okay I'm glad to see you today".&#160; And then I&#160;gave her a big hug. &#160;I said that because I know that Suzanne, our counselor on Thursdays, would love to have seen her too.&#160; I brought her &amp; her&#160;two friends into the Material Aid Room.&#160; Martha was pleased to have seen her too.&#160; One of her friends requested a pregnancy test but needed some water to help make that possible.&#160; So Martha went to get her a bottle of water in the office refrig.&#160; I asked our client how she was doing &amp; she said that she was doing fine &amp; that her baby was due now in August &amp; not in September.&#160;&#160;Great!!&#160; I asked if she need anything &amp; she said a bassinet.&#160; I said "are you kidding me, we have a beautiful bassinet in the back room but it's blue &amp; you're having a girl".&#160; "That's okay" she said so I said "okay lets go get it".&#160; Once she saw it she was so happy, even if it was blue, who really cares, right.&#160; The smile on her face was priceless.&#160; Just then Donna came in to use the bathroom &amp; saw us together talking &amp; she came over to us &amp; said "so you're having a boy".&#160; Are you kidding me.&#160; Our sweet client just smiled &amp; said "no I'm having a girl".&#160; It has already started.&#160; But that's okay, for it was free &amp; beautiful.&#160; Her baby daughter won't be affected in the least by everyone thinking that she is a boy or I should say I hope not.&#160; I was so happy that our client was happy.&#160; I told her to come back if she needed anything else &amp; that I wanted to see the baby after she was born &amp; for her to bring her in for us t see.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; Great!!&#160; Her friend took the pregnancy test &amp; was counseled by Martha &amp; off they went, very happy, all 3 of them.&#160; See you soon :)</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://nikkishell.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfaf553ef01156fc0ac08970c-800wi"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

There was another mother wanting baby&#160;&amp; children's clothes.&#160; Martha brought her into the Material Aid Room &amp; I went into the office, to do somethings, before going out to the front lines, to&#160;join the team.&#160; After Mass today Paula gave us 2 huge bags of clothes, that was now in the general meeting room, to be put away hopefully by Melody when she comes in today &amp; also Mary S. when she came today, to be on the front lines during her lunch hour, gave us 3 bags full of clothes too.&#160; Thanks you guys.&#160; Melody will be very busy when she&#160;gets here&#160;today.&#160; Martha was still in the Material Aid Room so I went in to help her but the door was locked.&#160; I knocked on the door &amp; Martha let me in.&#160; It was the 3 year old little girl that locked the door &amp; when I said "no honey , don't lock the door" I got a look that would make your hair curl.&#160; Oh boy!&#160; Another mother was now in the room too with her son.&#160; All I know is that someone, had pulled off all my flower stickers, that I had&#160;put on the wooden shelves, where I have the baskets of clothes.&#160;That's the price that you pay&#160;when you&#160;give out 'free clothes'.&#160; It gets so busy, in the room, that it's hard to watch everyone&#160;&amp; kids can be fast.&#160; I forgive whoever did that to my beautiful room.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.drhavinga.co.za/Kopluise/lice.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

she was returning it, for she wasn't able to be with us tomorrow or even next Tuesday, for she was going away.&#160; I asked if she had time to go outside with us for&#160; a little while &amp; she said that she had 2 hours that she could give us.&#160; Great Carole.! &#160;So off we all go in front of Planned Parenthood, all six of us, including our 6 year old.&#160; We went &amp; got the signs, the mega phone &amp; literature box &amp; went to the front lines.&#160; I got there first &amp; saw that a young man was sitting on the bench in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I called over to him &amp; offered him help &amp; told him what Planned Parenthood was all about (the short version) &amp; he started to holler nasty things to me &amp; then stood up &amp; did a gesture with his hands, between his legs, at me.&#160; I guess this was to shock me so I'd shut up but to no avail it didn't work.&#160; I went on talking to him &amp; then big Tony took over.&#160; The kid was relentless &amp; obnoxious to say the least &amp; then left to back inside the killing mill.&#160; Win some lose some, it's hard &amp; disappointing to say the least.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.picturesof.net/_images_300/Mean_Looking_Gingerbread_Man_Royalty_Free_Clipart_Picture_081216-202816-834042.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Just then a woman was walking towards Planned Parenthood &amp; I&#160;told her about the racism there but she walked in there anyway.&#160; How sad!&#160; Then the&#160;school&#160;bus driver honked at us with all his gusto &amp; the kids in the school bus waved.&#160; It was so good an experience for us who are so abused, at times.&#160; "Blessed are the persecuted for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven".&#160; Yeah!!!&#160; I had to go back into the center, to talk to Suzanne about something, &amp; I left Martha &amp; John &amp; Bill to do what they do best &amp; that is to witness.&#160; When I came back out,&#160;I need to stop doing that, for whenever I leave &amp; come back out, there is usually a problem.&#160; I saw that the woman that I had confronted before I went into the center was arguing with Martha &amp; John.&#160; I went to get my sign, to stand on the sidewalk to witness but when I heard what she was saying &amp; reacted.&#160; She said that she was pro choice &amp; that it was her body.&#160; I told her that she was "pro death" &amp; why would you do that to your body"?&#160; Then she said that she wasn't Black, okay you're Afro American, sorry.&#160; Still&#160;Planned Parenthood is targeting you as a Race.&#160; Then she&#160;started to do a Praise the Lord dance, saying Alleluia.&#160; I&#160;said that you can do that only after you repent first for thinking that it's okay to&#160;kill God's children, through abortion.&#160; Bill came over, from across the street,&#160;&amp; their faces were inches apart,&#160;to close for comfort, so I faked calling the police to get her off of the sidewalk.&#160; It worked.&#160; It usually does work, but&#160;there were two times that the guys were so arrogant, that they stayed to greet the police, that never came.&#160; But this is a good tactic to avoid any altercations, on the sidewalk.&#160;&#160;Off she goes, walking down the sidewalk,&#160;still defending her right to kill her baby.&#160; Not!!&#160; Sometimes you just can't get through to them.&#160; As she was walking away, there&#160;was Jim Bovay, the neighbor who lives across the street from the abortion mill, standing on the sidewalk across the street, just looking at me with his beedy eyes.&#160; Do you believe it!&#160;&#160;I don't.&#160; We have been trying to convert him &amp; the other neighbors, for the past 14&#160;years to no avail, that they are killing littler babies at Planned Parenthood &amp; that you should be doing something about it, like protesting with us.&#160; Brain dead.&#160; No one home <strong><font size="4">mentality. </font></strong>There he is standing,&#160;across the street, like a board just looking at me.&#160; Then he&#160;says "Mary you're crazy".&#160; Then John&#160;hollers over to him&#160;"then we're all crazy too".&#160; Then Jim&#160;spins his hand, by his head, to&#160;imply that I'm nuts.&#160; No Jim the word is out that it's you that's nuts.&#160; Anyone who believes that abortion, which is the slaughter of the innocent is okay, then they are ready for the funny farm.&#160; I'll drive.&#160; How sad is this.&#160; I asked him to "go away" &amp; he did, back into his own world of denial.&#160; It must be lonely there, oh no&#160;I forgot, he has his wife Sue &amp; the&#160;rest of the neighbors to keep him company.&#160; Icky!&#160;&#160;&#160;Misery loves company, so they say.&#160; I was glad that this old&#160;tart was&#160;gone.&#160; Yes, it got heated out there on the sidewalk, with this girl that was being convicted by her own words.&#160; It's funny, that a little noise bothers him, but not the killing of little, innocent babies, across the street, from where he lives.&#160;

to review the day &amp;&#160;later on&#160;John came in with the pizza, around 6:10pm,&#160;&amp; with a free bottle of Sprite, to boot.&#160; Everyone liked the pizza very much.&#160; I was not gracious, or I should say I was rude,&#160;for I had&#160;two pieces of pizza&#160;&amp; I should have given&#160;another one&#160;to Jane't, so that she had&#160;two pieces &amp; I had one. &#160;I can be selfish &amp; I do apologize dear Jane't, I'm sorry for my selfishness.&#160; Not nice of me.&#160;&#160;</strong></font></p></div><div><p><font size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/interior-painting-equipment-basics-ga-6.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Sometimes I feel like my Guardian Angel lifts me up &amp; fly's me to where I need to go.&#160; It's Heavenly. I was in the center, to do an orientation with Rose, our new person, for she will be helping out in the center three days a week.&#160; Betty made the chicken sandwiches for me to take out to the front lines for Martha &amp; John &amp; myself. I offered water to everyone &amp; most wanted a bottle of water, I suggested to them to drink it quickly, for if you didn't then it would be to warm to drink, for it was 100 degrees today or maybe it was 96 degrees, it felt like it was 100 degrees, whatever.&#160; We were blessed with a light breeze which helped us to survive.&#160; Thank you Lord for breathing gently on us.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://images.clipartof.com/small/28223-Clipart-Illustration-Of-A-Tough-Strong-White-Man-Flexing-His-Big-Arm-Muscles-And-Flashing-A-Mean-Face.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="62" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:a0gJV-ifRhXNlM:http://images.clipartof.com/small/28223-Clipart-Illustration-Of-A-Tough-Strong-White-Man-Flexing-His-Big-Arm-Muscles-And-Flashing-A-Mean-Face.jpg" /></a>I was at the fence calling to the girls going into Planned Parenthood &amp; then all of a sudden I heard a loud voice say "Mary.....&#160; SHUT UP".&#160; I looked across the street to see the nasty neighbor Jim, who has the condo, across the street from the Planned Parenthood, closest to Windsor St., cup his hands to holler this to me.&#160; I just ignored him &amp; went on calling out to the victims, of Planned Parenthood, to try to save them from death &amp; destruction.&#160; He had nothing better to do, poor neighbor, why don't you just move, for I'm not going away until Planned Parenthood closes.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://sciencegeekgirl.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/538px-man-and-woman-iconsvg.png"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="71" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Fgnk60iE4B1beM:http://sciencegeekgirl.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/538px-man-and-woman-iconsvg.png" /></a>The two long standing death escorts were there today.&#160; Sylvia Rose &amp; Barry Swan.&#160; They are the two longest deathers to date.&#160; 'Evil' doesn't grow tired, either does 'good'.&#160; We, pro lifers, are in it to the end.&#160; I was calling the male death escort "perverted" which his actions apply, for he is approaching the girls cars &amp; leading them into Planned Parenthood, to have their babies killed &amp; for them to be deceived &amp; ruin their lives &amp; souls. This is evil of both the male &amp; female death escorts. Definition of:<br /><br /><font color="#ff0000">Depraved:</font> deviating from what is considered moral or right or proper or good; "a perverted sense of loyalty".<br /><br /><font color="#ff0000">Perversion</font> is a concept describing those types of human behavior that are a serious deviation from what is considered to be orthodox or normal. <br />
Sounds right to me to describe what all the death escorts, abortionist &amp; staff are doing at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Depraved &amp; perverted behavior in killing 'little people'.&#160; One of the pro lifers asked if I could be sued for slander saying this to him.&#160; No, I don't think so, for it applies.&#160; The Truth is the Truth &amp; this is the Truth.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://norman.walsh.name/2003/06/18/images/truck.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="106" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:RgFUZ5GKjU4PoM:http://norman.walsh.name/2003/06/18/images/truck.jpg" /></a>A truck parked in front of the Planned Parenthood's building, right in front of the brick side, in back of another car.&#160; She got out &amp; put some money in the meter &amp; then walked into Planned Parenthood, while walking she gave me the 'bird'.&#160; I said "please don't show me your IQ, for we are here to help you for you are going into a place that&#160;kills&#160;children".&#160; Off she goes into the building.&#160; She came out about 15 minutes later &amp; I tried to talk to her again &amp; she shows her IQ again for a longer time, this time.&#160; I pleaded with her for she was caring a brown paper bag, which could mean condoms or the Morning after Pill, which acts as an abortificiant which(kills a person earlier on).&#160; I could tell by her 'body language that I was getting no where with her.&#160; She got into her truck &amp; then I heard a noise.&#160; I said to the male pro lifer "I think that she just hit the car that's in front of her, just now".&#160;&#160; He said in a nervous voice "that's my car!" &amp; started to run over to see what damage, that had possibly been done, to his car.&#160; I walked over to be with him.&#160; He told her that she just had hit his car &amp; bent over to see if there was any damage done to it.&#160; It didn't look like that there was, thank God.&#160; I had a Truth packet with me &amp; the male pro lifer asked her if she would take it &amp; she said "okay" &amp; took the packet.&#160; I said to her that they are killing children in there &amp; I get a little emotional, as a woman, so forgive me if I was hard on you.&#160; I told her about the Morning after Pill &amp; she said that she was in there for condoms &amp; that they told her that she could get 'free birth control'.&#160; I said that there was a lot of information, in the packet that will educate her about birth control.&#160; She said that her past boyfriend was in jail &amp; they broke up &amp; she need the condoms for her new boyfriend.&#160; Then she said that she was once a Catholic, not sure why she mentioned that but we addressed that too.&#160; The pro lifer said that there was a Rosary in the packet &amp; for her to start to say it &amp; I mentioned for her to go to the Sacrament of Confession.&#160; She smiled a little smile &amp; then said "is everything okay now to the male pro lifer"?&#160; He said that his car was fine.&#160; So she smiled at him &amp; said to him "thanks".&#160; Off she went back into the world a more educated person who now has a 'second chance', with her life &amp; soul.&#160; See how God works, it's amazing!!!</font></strong></p></div><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p>

After she came back I went back into the center to see how things were going.&#160; About 10 minutes later Martha was in the center &amp; with her were a pregnant woman &amp; a man &amp; a beautiful little girl.&#160; She brought them into the Rose Room &amp; the Material Aid Room, for a stroller.&#160; What happened was they went into Planned Parenthood to get some information regarding pre natal doctors &amp; were told, as they were going in, by the death escort&#160; "not to listen to those crazy people out there".&#160; Who are you talking about 'death escort'?&#160; Don't talk about yourself that way.&#160; When they came out Martha interceded &amp; lead them to the Focus Center to assist them.&#160; The pregnant woman told Martha that she was told by the woman at the front desk, in Planned Parenthood,&#160; that all they were doing today were termination's.&#160; My heart was sickened by that comment.&#160; So casual in saying that all they were doing today was ending the lives of innocent, voiceless defenseless children.&#160; How sick, How evil!!!&#160; Martha assisted this family &amp; got her connected to a good doctor who will see her tomorrow morning with her high risk pregnancy.&#160; They went back into the Material Aid Room to get some things for their precious daughter to take with them.&#160; Out the door they go, with their new stroller &amp; very happy that they were well taken care of, in a place that doesn't kill babies.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://brog.engrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/danger-educated-black-woman.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 57px; float: left; height: 81px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="45" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:HQjlMG8a6kx8bM:http://brog.engrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/danger-educated-black-woman.jpg" /></a>Martha &amp; I were now back on the front lines &amp; prayed &amp; sidewalk counseled.

Century, DVD. She said "if I take it then will you not say anything to my son &amp; I when I walk back into the parking lot".&#160; I said "yes, if you take &amp; watch this DVD we'll not say anything to you &amp; your son".&#160; "Okay" she said &amp; she took it &amp; walked back into the parking lot &amp; as she was turning the corner she said "I just want you to know that I agree with you", then left.&#160; We honored her request &amp; they finally left about 20 minutes later.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she keeps her promise &amp; watches the DVD.&#160; Amen sister.&#160; Please don't come back to Planned Parenthood again with your son.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://musiclab.atu.edu/images/DVD.png"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I asked him if he wanted a Rosary, we began to talk &amp; Martha offered him the Maafa 21 DVD &amp; he took it &amp; said that he &amp; his friends will watch it.&#160; Hopefully so, what a surprise it will be for you &amp; your friends.&#160; One DVD at a time to educate &amp; to change the minds of the people, through the grace of God.&#160; Sooner or later someone will get the message that Planned Parenthood is killing off the Black Race &amp; will do something about it in a peaceful way, like organizing a huge protest against Planned Parenthood, held over 100 days, right in front of the building 24/7.&#160; The media would pick up on the story &amp; it would be covered on all local TV channels &amp; the Democrat &amp; (liberal) Chronicle, would do a story on the front page &amp; it would be a fair &amp; balanced article, a page long, telling what Planned Parenthood does, like kills people &amp; not reporting statuary rape &amp; targeting the Black Race (Black Genocide) &amp; are sex perverts, check out their Teen Wire web site, which would make your hair curl.&#160; Where is every one?&#160;

angry that they are a part of killing little innocent, precious babies, which God had just created in the wombs of their mothers &amp; that people shouldn't kill kids, let alone it being their own mother.&#160; It will ONLY take God's grace to penetrate their stony hearts, not me.&#160; God be the Glory!<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://media.cnsnews.com/resources/67564.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="55" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:GSSPz-diVJUkHM:http://media.cnsnews.com/resources/67564.jpg" /></a>Just then Jerry &amp; Charles showed up to pray, the Rosary, across the street.

I just a call, on my cell phone, from the Mercy Outreach Center asking if we could take a client &amp; do a pregnancy teat.&#160; I said "yes, ask her to come on over, does she know where we are located"?&#160; The answer came "yes, she does".&#160; I told Suzanne to expect a client to come in for a pregnancy teat in the next 30 minutes or so.&#160; She did arrive &amp; Suzanne took her into the Rose Room. When the client was in the bathroom I saw that there was Suzanne, Pat &amp; Rose in the room &amp; said "there should be only one person in here". Suzanne smiled &amp; said that they all prayed together &amp; the client said that it was fine to have all three in the room at the same time for the test. Whatever the client says is fine with me.&#160; This is not usually the case but today it was &amp; Suzanne was able to show both Pat &amp; Rose how assist with the pregnancy tests, though we have our clients do the test, we only set up for the test, &amp; the client does the test &amp; reads the test results.&#160; We ask questions to fill out the Client Intake Sheet for our records &amp; to better assist our client with her needs now &amp; in the future.&#160; After the test I was asked if we had any Bus passes &amp; I said "no" but I'd give some money for a bus, for her, but we wanted her to be happy so we called her a cab, in the office right next to ours.&#160; They took her home.&#160; How convenient.<br /><br />
Suzanne &amp; Pat had to leave so Rose started supper &amp; we talked.&#160; First I wanted to go back outside, to see how John was doing, &amp; to have him come in now, for it was passed 4:30pm.&#160; We brought all the signs &amp; the literature box, into the center.&#160; He then worked on some projects, I had for him, in the office.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0LLmWzKbOS4/TB3Q0E_uFYI/AAAAAAAAAVw/8zvph2KGe8A/s1600/tear-drop.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="100" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ChpQ3k_weABsNM:http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0LLmWzKbOS4/TB3Q0E_uFYI/AAAAAAAAAVw/8zvph2KGe8A/s1600/tear-drop.jpg" /></a>While I was out there, on the sidewalk, I noticed that the two young people were now leaving, after being in there for 3 hours.&#160; I spoke to them as they were leaving.&#160; Lord have Mercy on their souls.&#160; I went back into the center &amp; a few minutes later the doorbell rang &amp; it was Memo, who will be doing our spread sheets.&#160; Thanks so much for all your help, I really appreciate it.&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;I cleaned up the mess in the Meeting Room, for the painter had to leave.&#160; It looks beautiful in there now, so fresh &amp; clean &amp; bright.&#160; </font></strong></p></font></font></font><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font size="+0"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Tuesday 13, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></span><br style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif" /><br style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif" /><font size="4"><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.wellnesscatalyst.com/images/busy_woman.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="63" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nlMtE2e66PM9CM:http://www.wellnesscatalyst.com/images/busy_woman.jpg" /></a>When I arrived to the center Bill was there ready to put in the wood shelves in the cabinet that houses our signs &amp; literature packets.&#160; The shelves didn't fit so he'll be back tomorrow with the saw to fix the problem.&#160; As he was in the Material Aid Room working the male pro lifer came in &amp; then Mary S. to get some signs to take outside to start counseling.&#160; Martha was getting ready to go outside too.&#160; I went &amp; got coffee, next door at Macks, for both Martha &amp; Sandy, for they are the coffee drinkers.

When I arrived to the front lines I saw that the abortionist, Rachel Phelps wasn't there but you aren't going to trust Planned Parenthood, so we were ready to counsel as everyone was going in for an abortion &amp; take it from there, with the power of the Holy Spirit giving discernment.&#160; We set the sidewalk with the graphic &amp; non graphic signs to witness the Truth.&#160; We have had two women, just in the last two days, say that their babies were saved from being aborted by seeing the graphic signs.&#160;

I put the batteries in the mega phone &amp; went into the Material Aid Room to meet the new client.&#160; She was a delightful young woman with a beautiful smile.&#160; She was over at Planned Parenthood to get a pregnancy test &amp; was told that she was pregnant &amp; then said to her "are you planning to terminate this pregnancy"?&#160; She abruptly said to her "no, of course not".&#160; Then she left.&#160; She was walking out of Planned Parenthood &amp; was coming around the bushes &amp; Martha &amp; Donna started to talk to her &amp; then Martha brought her into the center for a baby blanket &amp; some more literature &amp; the Growth &amp; Development DVD of the baby in the womb.&#160; She was delighted.&#160; I asked her to fill out the Intake Sheet, so that Suzanne our counselor on Thursdays,&#160;could call her &amp; see how she is doing with her pregnancy.&#160; She said that she had to go to catch the bus but that she would fill it out first.&#160;

The wind was blowing our signs all over the place &amp; it was now about 5pm so we went into the center to do our work in there.&#160; I had to make some phone calls &amp; do some paperwork.&#160; Martha &amp; Melody were working in the Material Aid Room, putting&#160;more things away.&#160; I called Pat the grandmother, who fights for the lives of her great grandbabies, from being killed by abortion, &amp; told her that I had her $200 for her that was given by a generous donor.&#160; She said that she was&#160;coming over for she had to be careful for she had sprained her ankle.&#160; Oh no!!&#160; Poor Pat.&#160; She came about 10 minutes later to get the money, formula for baby Akira, our little preemie baby who is 15 lbs. now.&#160; She picked up some baby clothes too.&#160; As I was talking to her the doorbell rang.&#160; I walked over to the door &amp; there were 2 familiar people standing there.&#160; I said that we&#160;were closed but she insisted to come in to get some things, so I said "okay come on in".&#160; Martha took over &amp; was with them in the Material Aid Room.&#160; They come regularly &amp; usually get quit a few things.&#160; &#160;&#160;I went back to talk to Pat some more.&#160; She looks tired &amp; we try to help make her load lighter by God's grace.&#160; She was grateful &amp; said that she would be here for the Mass on Saturday morning.&#160; Very good Pat, see you then.&#160; She limped back to the car, with her friend, who came in to help her with the bags of baby clothes &amp; diapers.&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/images/dt-pastawithzucchiniandeggplant.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

They came back with me to the center.&#160;As&#160;I was pulling in the driveway to the center I noticed that Maria was standing on the brick side of the building of Planned Parenthood holding her sign that read "I REGRET MY ABORTION".&#160; I waved at her &amp; went into the center to show Anne around &amp; to talk with her for awhile.&#160; It was about 12:40pm &amp; I was expecting Martha there around 1pm so I wasn't worried.&#160; Anne said good bye &#160;&amp; then I went to the sidewalk to say to Maria &amp; o tell her that I would be right out but when I turned the corner she wasn't there.&#160; I looked in the parking lot &amp; saw that the abortionist was there for her dark blue car was parked by the back door.&#160; It made me sick &amp; I wanted to get out on the sidewalk as soon as I could.&#160; I went back into the center wondering where Martha was &amp; why did Maria go before her 2 hours were up?&#160; I started to put the food away &amp; went on to make 2 ham sandwiches for Martha &amp; I for lunch.&#160; As I was finished making up the sandwiches the doorbell rang &amp; went to answer it &amp; there was Maria standing there.&#160; I said "what happened Maria where did you go"?&#160; She said that she left to go Subway to get a sandwich.&#160; I said that I was making sandwiches for Martha &amp; I for I didn't have time to make them at home this morning for I was running late for church.&#160; So it made sense to me to eat my sandwich with Maria instead of eating I outside on the front lines.&#160; As&#160;I was finishing the sandwich&#160;my cell phone rang.&#160; I answered the phone thinking that it was Martha calling to say that she wasn't coming today but it wasn't Martha it was a woman who told me that her friend's daughter was going to have an abortion at Planed Parenthood at 1pm.&#160; What!&#160; It was now 1:20pm, my heart sank &amp; I felt sick.&#160; I asked her why she didn't call me earlier &amp; she said that she just found out &amp; her friend told her to call the Focus Center to intervene.&#160; I said I needed to go &amp; then hung up.&#160; I dropped everything &amp; went out to the sidewalk with the literature box &amp; one sign &amp; the mega phone.&#160; No one was going in so I just hollered to everyone who was in Planned Parenthood already.&#160; I went over to the brick side of the building so I could be closer to the waiting room.&#160; I then saw Martha walking up the sidewalk &amp; used the mega phone to tell her what just happened.&#160;She went back into he center to get the Our Lady of Guadeloupe sign &amp; the picture of Jesus holding the aborted baby crying.&#160; The wind was blowing so hard that we couldn't putout any more signs today.&#160; I called out saying that we could help everyone &amp; that abortion was taking a life &amp; that the baby's heartbeat was taking place just 18 to 20 days after conception &amp; so on.&#160; After about an half hour I went back over to be with Martha &amp; told her that I was going into the center to see if Maria was still there.&#160; She said okay &amp; that she would be fine out there alone.&#160;I went into the center &amp; saw that Maria was there sitting at the desk folding up our new brochures.&#160; I said "thank you Maria"&#160;&amp; spoke with her for a few minutes then left.&#160; She said that got to the sidewalk around 12 noon &amp; stayed until 12:45pm to go to get a sandwich.&#160; I said that there was a good chance that the girl that I got the phone call about saw you holding&#160;your&#160;sign&#160;&amp; went back home, without having an abortion.&#160; That could have happen I said to her.&#160;&#160;Maria said that she felt lead to go out to the sidewalk early today.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; I went back outside to be with Martha.&#160; A few minutes later I saw 3 young girls walking up the street going towards Planned Parenthood on the brick side of the building.&#160; Martha flagged them over towards us.&#160; They walked over to us &amp; I lead them to the center to talk&#160;to Maria who is African American &amp; so were the girls, so they could relate to one another.&#160; I rang the doorbell to give Maria a heads up &amp; then brought the 3 girls into the center.&#160; Maria brought the girls into the new Rose Room for counseling &amp; a pregnancy test for one of the girls.&#160; I turned on the TV which had a DVD in it that showed the pictures of a baby in the womb.&#160; It is an excellent DVD that Father C. burned for us.&#160; I set up the pregnancy test for Maria &amp; gave the girls the Truth packets, for each of them then left for Maria to counsel.&#160; I&#160;went back to the front lines&#160; to be with Martha.&#160; The wind was blowing her away at times.&#160; She said that the sign she was holding blew up the street a ways but she retrieved it.&#160; She also said that she handed out 2 Truth packets to 2 girls that were walking out of Planned Parenthood&#160;&amp; spoke to the girls for a short time.&#160; About a half an hour later we saw that the 3 girls were walking up the sidewalk &amp; as they passed us on the sidewalk they said to Martha &amp; I that they wanted to volunteer.&#160; We said that would be great &amp; that we will be on the sidewalk again tomorrow from 1-5pm.&#160; "Okay" they said with smiles on their faces &amp; then walked up the street towards E. Main St., probably to catch the bus.&#160; They were so young.&#160; &#160;Great job Maria!!&#160; As we were talking to the girls Maria was driving by &amp; gave us a honk to say good bye.&#160; See you next week my friend.</font></strong>&#160;</p><font color="#ff0000"><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><strong>The school bus driver passes us by, when we are out there on the front lines &amp; gives us a honk &amp; a wave &amp; so do some of the children on his bus.&#160; It's great to experience the love.&#160; A young woman was coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I called over to her from the fence by the bushes.&#160; I noticed that she was coming over to Martha &amp; I, so I told Martha to get ready.&#160; Just then the woman arrived from around the bushes &amp; stopped to talk to us.&#160; The first thing she said was "why are you hollering at these girls most of them are hear for contraceptives".&#160; I then said to her that some contraceptives can cause an early abortion .&#160; I then offered her the Truth packet to which she replied that she was a medical student &amp; she didn't need it.&#160; I then said to her that that was scary for me to hear that a medical student didn't want to learn the truth about something that is pertaining to medicine &amp; that if you become a doctor I don't want you to take of me.&#160; Well how's that for an ear full.&#160; After that scolding she seemed to change her attitude towards what Martha &amp; I were trying to tell her. She then said that it scares the girls when we holler &amp; for us to go into Planned Parenthood to talk to the staff &amp; look around.&#160; Gulp, my stomach turned around inside me.&#160; I then said&#160; Planned Parenthood has tried to sue us&#160;that for they are the ones that have put up the bushes &amp; made the Yellow Line, on the sidewalk, for us not to cross over to be able to speak calmly to the people going into Planned Parenthood, to be lied to &amp; deceived &amp; to have their babies killed.&#160; They don't want the girls to know the truth &amp; to get the right kind of help for them.&#160; We have a pregnancy center right next to this yellow building &amp; I pointed over to where we are located &amp; at the center we help our clients with free pregnancy test &amp; counseling, referrals &amp; free baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; We don't kill, they do.&#160; She said that she agreed to that we were doing at the center.&#160; Martha mentioned that abortion is against God's law that says "Thou shall not kill", she also agreed to that statement, for she seemed to know God.&#160; Then the medical student said "I have spoken to Rachel Phelps, who is the abortionist at Planned Parenthood, &amp; she is a nice person &amp; thinks that she is doing good".&#160; I quickly replied saying "no she is not a good person for a good person would not take a life, &amp; that you don't do an evil to bring forth a good, she is greatly misguided &amp; we pray that she will stop killing babies &amp; do good with her degree".&#160; She seemed to understand so much more then she did when she first arrived on the sidewalk.&#160; I then took a chance &amp; re offered her the Truth packet &amp; said to her that it would make me very happy if she took it.&#160; She smiled &amp; reached out her hand to take it.&#160; I got greedy so I offered her the DVD of Growth &amp; Development, in the womb, &amp; included in the case was the Maafa21:Black Genocide in the 21st Century DVD &amp; also our Focus Center brochure &amp; the rubberized 12 week old baby.&#160; She took it all.&#160; WOW!!&#160; Praise God for the grace for her to turn around.&#160; Now she is an educated medical student&#160;&amp; I told her that I would not mind being her patient.&#160; She smiled again.&#160; Martha asked her her name &amp; she said it was Julia.&#160; So when she was leaving we both said "good bye Dr. Julia" &amp; she waved as she was leaving the parking lot of Planned Parenthood.&#160; What an experience this was this afternoon.</strong>&#160; </font></font></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><strong>A car stopped on the street &amp; the woman driver hollered out the window "do you have any of those beads, meaning the Rosary"?&#160; Martha said "yes we do &amp; we have baby clothes too for your baby, so turn around &amp; come follow me".&#160; She turned her car around &amp; followed Martha into the parking lot to the center &amp; then to the Material Aid Room.&#160;&#160;She&#160;helped them to get some nice things.&#160; One of the young girls then asked for a pregnancy test, so Martha gave her a pregnancy test.&#160; Then the other woman said that she will come back another time to get a pregnancy test.&#160; Martha said "that's fine we will be here".&#160; They both received a Truth packet &amp; some Rosaries &amp; some nice things for the cute little baby girl.&#160; They left saying "thank you" to Martha.&#160; Then Martha came back to the front lines &amp; Tucker had just arrived for his 4-6pm shift. &#160;A few minutes later, a woman with two children, a boy &amp; a girl about 6 &amp; 7 years of age came from behind the bushes.&#160; We approached her &amp; offered a pregnancy test.&#160; She made it sound like that she needed one &amp; we lead her into the center for one.&#160; But once she got to the center she changed her mind &amp; wanted condoms.&#160; Martha told her that we don't hand out condoms &amp; she told her the truth about them.&#160; I came in to the room &amp; heard what they were talking about &amp; then went to the counseling room to get her brochures about condoms, to educate her.&#160; She also picked up a few things for her children then left.&#160; After she left Martha clued me in that she wanted condoms &amp; not the literature talking about them.&#160; Martha educated&#160;her the best way she could &amp; she did take the brochures, so we felt that there was a job well done, though she left a bad taste in Martha's mouth,&#160;it was probably her attitude.&#160; Hope all goes well for her &amp; that she doesn't have anymore sex outside of marriage, that will&#160;affect the lives of her 2 precious children, that she is responsible for.&#160; Martha went back outside to be with Tucker &amp; I went into the Material Aid Room to start to put things away, that I had in my car, from the second hand store that dropped them off in my garage to bring to the center for our clients.&#160; It was mostly baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; Martha &amp; I re-arranged the shelves &amp; straightened up the room to make it look attractive for our clients.&#160; I was overwhelmed so I went outside to ask Martha to come in to help me. Tucker said that he was fine out here by himself witnessing &amp; praying for the end to abortion.&#160; Martha &amp; I worked for awhile then stopped to eat &amp; then resumed our work until about 9pm then left to go home.&#160; What a day!!</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; </font></font></p><p><font color="#000000">&#160;&#160;</font></p><div><hr /></div><div><p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Thursday, April 29, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>The abortionist was there at Planned Parenthood &amp; so was the Death Escort, how sad. &#160;Martha &amp; I &amp; Bill who witnesses across the street,&#160;were all ready, by the grace of God, to fight the good fight.&#160; We sent up the sidewalk with graphic signs,&#160;to witness the Truth, &amp; to help people change their lives.&#160; A young girl came over to us &amp; Martha brought her to the Material Aid Room for baby clothes.&#160; The mom was a happy woman after she was blessed with many nice things.&#160; Martha came back out on the sidewalk, to be with me, who was sidewalk counseling.&#160; The cars, diving by were mostly nice, giving us a good honk &amp; waiving to us.&#160;I think that we give some people a good feeling that someone cares to help the victims of Planned Parenthood.&#160; We were giving people Rosaries, on the sidewalk, as they passed by us &amp; we heard their stories, which some of them were painful to hear.&#160; We would then give them literature that could help them to heal.&#160; Just then Suzanne had arrived at the center which is always a good thing.&#160; Now we just have to ring the doorbell &amp; she will answer &amp; take it from there, so that Martha &amp; I can go back to the sidewalk, to help more people that are lied to, by Planned Parenthood.&#160; About 20 minutes later Melody showed up to help out in the Material Aid Room &amp; to make up some Truth packets that we need.&#160; She loves to make up these packets.&#160; In the meantime, Suzanne our Thursday counselor, started to call our clients,&#160;that are going to deliver &amp; that have delivered,&#160;to see how they are doing,&#160;&amp;&#160;to see if we can help them in any way.

People came up to her after Mass to offer her assistance &amp; one woman interviewed her for an article in her local newspaper, where she has done human interests stories before.&#160; It was so good to see Jose, for I haven't seen him in awhile, he is on the Board of Focus, but he is busy going to school plus working full time &amp;

of course brownies.&#160; Yummy!&#160; Finally the pizza &amp; wings came &amp; the delivery man said that he was stopped by the police, I guess for speeding.&#160; I hope it wasn't because of our pizza.&#160; They knocked $3.00 off the price, which was a deal.&#160; The pizza &amp; wings were a hit, thank God.&#160; Worth waiting for.&#160; Martha had made her famous macaroni salad &amp; that tied us over too, before the pizza came.&#160; Anne had brought us a fairly new computer given to us by my former boss which is her husband.&#160; They will deliver us a refrigerator this coming week for the center.&#160; How nice of the Orlando's.&#160; We were blessed with a good monetary collection for the work of the center.&#160; We are blessed with generous people to help us.&#160; The&#160; Landlord came by for the rent &amp; I asked him if I could get a $30 reduction for buying the paint, for the counseling room.&#160; He said "yes".&#160; Thank you Lord for melting his heart.&#160; There was great conversation &amp; a happy time, in the love, of friends.&#160; I showed the people the new Rose Room &amp; they all loved it.&#160; After everyone had left &amp; there was only Martha &amp; Pat &amp; I left, I took some time to talk to Pat.&#160; Martha then went into the bathroom &amp; was there for awhile when Pat had said loudly to Martha if she was okay.&#160; Martha replied "no".&#160; I went to the door of the bathroom &amp; Martha came out.&#160; She said that she was very dizzy &amp; had vomited.&#160; Oh no!&#160; She went &amp; sat on the sofa to get her barrens &amp; Pat &amp; I tried to comfort her.&#160; She finally said that she was feeling better but needed to go home.&#160; I understand poor Martha.&#160; After she left I again sat down to talk to Pat again &amp; then I gave her some things, for her two great grandbabies, given to Pat from Anne.&#160; It was diapers &amp; formula.&#160; I gave Pat all the leftover deserts to take home to her family, which I know they would enjoy, especially her grandson Aaron, who is a growing boy.&#160; After Pat had left, my friend in the Taxi company, which is located in the room next to the office, &amp; asked me if he could help me.&#160; I quickly said "yes".&#160; He put back the chairs &amp; vacuumed &amp;

What a blessing they are to us.&#160; What a beautiful morning &amp; afternoon, in the Lord.&#160; Hope that you feel better dear Martha.&#160; Off I went for the 4:30pm Mass.&#160; I went back after Mass to do some more things at the center &amp;

I offered her the Truth packet &amp; she said something but it was hard to hear from that distance.&#160; Just then I heard a honk &amp; looked over to see that it was Maria, who is an African American counselor at the Focus Center, she comes once in awhile but when she does it's powerful.&#160; I waved back to her wishing that she would stop to help me.&#160; My prayers got answered real fast.&#160; There she was turning around &amp; parking at the brick side of Planned Parenthood where this girl was standing.&#160; I went over to greet her &amp; to give her a heads up on the situation.&#160; Maria approached the girl to tell her that abortion was wrong.&#160; She said to Maria &amp; I&#160; "I've got a child &amp;&#160;I have had&#160;an abortion &amp; if&#160;I get pregnant again&#160;I would abort that baby too".&#160; So also said that&#160; if her young sister ever gets pregnant she would kick her stomach in.&#160; Oh so rough &amp; tough.&#160; It sounds horrible, which it is, but you really know that she is in so much pain from her past abortion &amp; she is lashing out.&#160; I handed her a Truth packet which she took &amp; then I&#160; was planning to go back into the center, to wait for Chris to set up&#160;our new computer, so I was going to leave her to talk with Maria, for Maria is post abortive x2 &amp; she would be able to counsel her, in getting&#160;the help that she really needs.&#160; She holds her sign, on the sidewalk,&#160;that reads "I REGRET MY ABORTIONS".&#160; It is powerful message for people to see &amp;

He said that his girlfriend was in there for a pregnancy test &amp; wanted a baby &amp; they didn't believe in abortion.&#160; I told him that Planned Parenthood does &amp; if she's pregnant they will offer her to terminate, which means to kill your baby.&#160; I said that we at the Focus Center do free pregnancy tests &amp; that we were located right next to this big yellow building.&#160; I gave a Truth packet &amp; told him not to give it to anyone in there if they ask to take it.&#160; He said "thank you &amp; no I won't give it to anyone &amp; I'm going back in there to talk to my girlfriend".&#160; Maria &amp; I said "okay, we are here for you &amp; your girlfriend".&#160; Then he walked back into Planned Parenthood.&#160;

I was in shock, for I thought he told me that his girlfriend wasn't abortion minded but wanted a baby?&#160; I looked at her &amp; said "oh no you don't want to have your baby killed, lets do a pregnancy test".&#160; Then the young man said that he needed to get back to his girlfriend who's still in Planned Parenthood.&#160; I looked puzzled &amp; said "isn't this young lady your girlfriend'?&#160; He said "no she was just in the waiting room over there &amp; I told her to come over here to get&#160;a pregnancy test &amp; she came".&#160; Oh!!&#160; Off he goes &amp; then I take this young girl into the Rose Room.&#160; She did the pregnancy test &amp; it was negative &amp; she quickly said that she really wasn't going to have an abortion if it was positive".&#160; Thank God that we will never really know.&#160; I gave her our DVD &amp; literature packet &amp; added more information for her.&#160; Then I gave her a doctors list &amp; she chose one of the doctors, to see that afternoon, to get testing for STD's.&#160; She got an early afternoon appointment &amp; was very grateful for the assistance &amp;

answered her questions.&#160; The young man wasn't in the room he went back outside.&#160; About 10 minutes later the doorbell rang &amp; it was this same man, I though to pick up his girlfriend, but first he said to me that he had talked to a girl who was at Planned Parenthood &amp; was going to have an abortion this week, her mother was making her, &amp; she was crying.&#160; He said that she was walking up Gibbs St. probably to get a bus on Main St.., I walked over to see that she was so far away, for me to reach her, so I said to this 'White Knight' "go run &amp; give her this package of information &amp; save her baby"!!&#160; He did, he ran like the wind &amp; he caught up with her to talk to her &amp; to give her the packet of information. It also had the rubberized 12 week old baby &amp; the growth &amp; development chart on the back of the card,&#160;in the literature bag.&#160; He came back into the center about 5 minutes later saying that he wanted to work for me.&#160; I said "you have&#160;a job".&#160; He smiled.&#160; He joined his girlfriend in the Rose Room &amp; I&#160;went back in&#160;&amp; spoke with them for a few more minutes &amp; then we all said good bye.&#160; I thanked him again for all that he did this morning in 'saving lives'.&#160; I think that he felt real good about himself too.&#160; Thank you Lord!!&#160; What a morning &amp; I never come on Monday mornings, maybe I should.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.old-picture.com/indians/pictures/Indian-Woman.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="59" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:vPDDyK0OERTCIM:http://www.old-picture.com/indians/pictures/Indian-Woman.jpg" /></a></font></strong></p><div><p><font size="4"><strong><font color="#000000">After they left I peaked my head outside to see if Maria was okay &amp; she waved at me indicating that she was fine so I went back into the center to see how Chris was doing.&#160;&#160;He also was doing fine &amp; was please with our new gift from our former boss, Matt.&#160; I wanted to go to go to Mass at 12:10pm &amp; it was now about 11:45am when the doorbell rang.&#160; I went to the door to see a woman standing there.&#160; I opened the door &amp; said 'hello, can I help you"?&#160; She answered back to me "the lady outside said that you do free pregnancy tests &amp; I would like one".&#160; I replied "yes, come follow me".&#160; I led her to the Rose Room &amp; she filled out the Intake Sheet, like all the clients do, &amp; I got the test ready for her to take.&#160; She did &amp; she was negative so I spent a few minutes teaching her abstinence &amp; chastity &amp; gave her specific pieces of literature to read that would help you to achieve her goal.&#160; I also gave her the Truth packet with has a Rosary in every packet.&#160; She thanked me &amp; off she went.&#160; I said good bye to Chris &amp; thanked him &amp; gave him a big hug &amp; off I went to Mass.&#160; As I was leaving I waved good bye to Maria up the street.&#160; She said earlier that she will be back next month to counsel in the center &amp; to be out on the street to witness.&#160; Great Maria, we'll miss you.&#160; What a morning, in less than 3 hours, I gave 3 pregnancy tests &amp; counseled &amp; gave away a lot of literature &amp;&#160;I believe, in my heart, one life saved, through the grace of God.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I need to descern if the Lord wants me or someone else to be there, on the sidewalk in front of Planed Parenthood, on Monday mornings?&#160; My goal, which is my prayer,&#160;is to have someone there, all the times that Planned Parenthood is open, from 7:30am to 7pm, Monday through Friday.&#160; Please Lord please sent in your troops!!</font></strong>&#160; </font></p></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Tuesday, May 4, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Martha, John, Jerry&#160;&amp; I got to the center after Mass &amp; Sandy was already there waiting to be let in.&#160; I asked her if she could get the things, that were in my car that needed to be sorted out, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I gave her&#160;my car&#160;keys after I opened up all the rooms in the center.&#160; Martha &amp; John were getting the sign &amp; mega phone &amp; signs to take to the front lines to witness.&#160; I was planning to join them but I never was able to get out to the front lines until about 3:30pm for I &amp; Sandy &amp; later on Melody, when she arrived, were keep very busy, in the center today.&#160;</strong></font></p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs1743/hji/medium/1987-men-beard.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="60" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nWzVIBuFq_P5OM:http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs1743/hji/medium/1987-men-beard.jpg" /></a></strong></font></p><p>&#160;</p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>I saw that a woman&#160;had walked into the center from outside, for we have a landlord that won't fix anything, so the door doesn't catch behind anyone who is leaving unless they shut the door tight which they usually don't.&#160;&#160;So anyone can walk in at in any time.&#160; I saw that she was heading to the Material Aid Room so I figured that she had been here before.

They agreed.&#160; Thank you for the grace dear Lord to change hearts &amp; minds.&#160; As they were leaving I again reminded them to watch the movie Bella.&#160; All their worries can change in a flash but you can't put the baby back again once you've torn him or her apart.&#160; Life changes so trust in the Lord who loves you.&#160; For the Bible says that "He careth for you".&#160; I was so happy that they were driving to go home &amp; not to Planned Parenthood to kill.&#160; Donna told me later that as they passed her on the sidewalk she hollered out her window that she changed her mind &amp; chose life.&#160; Thank you Lord &amp; Praise you!&#160; I took a deep breathe &amp; walked back into the office to see how Sandy was coming with the packets.&#160; She had made up quite a few so I said that I would go out to give them to the warriors on the sidewalk.&#160; I walked over to the pro lifers when Martha told me that they had to call the police on someone who came into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood hollering "I'm going to kill &amp; there's nothing you can say or do to change my mind".&#160; Lord have Mercy.&#160; The girl &amp; guy came over to John &amp; got into his face &amp; took a packet then throw it at him.&#160; Mary S. called the police &amp; four police cars came to talk to the kid who was outside standing by his car smoking a cigarette.&#160; </strong></font></p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://waiting002.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/police-car1.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

He was using free speech and a group was angry and started cursing.&#160; It went back and forth a little then a woman got really hot and got in his face pointing her finger.&#160; I was actually on the other side of the building today but saw the whole thing develop, Jerry was across the street facing the PP exit (all could see his sign and crucifix) they saw us all left, right and center and there was&#160; a lot of traffic.&#160; </font><font face="Arial">Anyway, back to John.&#160; The woman started to get physical and touched John, jabbing and finally throwing the packet into the street. Two other women came over and finally with the commotion (caused by them) the young man came tearing around the corner but it did not appear that he touched John. Since there were four of them and I did not know how bad it would get,&#160; I called 911. The young man glanced at me and I felt he knew what I was doing. I calmly asked the operator for a police drive-by as I explained that&#160; a Planned Parenthood patron was getting physical with a protester on the street.&#160;</font><font face="Arial">Two police cars came and went directly into the parking lot. No one came over to any of us.&#160; Believe it or not, three more cops showed up, all going in to the parking lot. We all kept back to a legal position so I don't know if the police spoke to anyone ( maybe Jerry knows)?&#160; No they didn't I found out later.&#160;</font><font face="Arial">They left and then I had to leave. When I left, John was still in the center probably having told you ( Mary) what happened. I told Martha that I was concerned about when the group leaves that they might get crazy again and the police had left. I just wanted you to know and I pray that all protesters stay safe. </font><font face="Arial">I have to say John sure kept his composure and it helped that Martha had sprinkled blessed salt on the sidewalk where he stood.</font></font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/images/300/mother_toddler_play.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

donate a gift to the work of the radio station".&#160; I said "yes that sounds like a good idea lets donate $25".&#160; She said "that's great &amp; I'll call".&#160; So she got the phone number &amp; called.&#160; We wanted to challenge&#160;other Pregnancy Centers to call in &amp; all pro lifers too.&#160; About 10 minutes later we were on the radio.&#160; They said that the Focus Pregnancy Help Center wants to challenge&#160; all pro lifers to call in &amp; to donate to the work of the station.&#160; Yeah!&#160; We were able to help them &amp; they were able to help us.&#160; More people now know that we are here on University Ave.&#160; What a blessing.&#160; Martha &amp; I went back to work in the center &amp; left around 8pm.&#160; <br /><br /></font></strong></p></div></font><hr /><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4">&#160;</font></strong><div><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Thursday May 6, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></div><div><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">After Mass, Martha &amp;

Century DVD &amp; the Truth packet, to educate him,&#160;so he could change things through this education in&#160;the community.&#160; He said that he sees us when he drives by &amp; decided to finally stop to talk with us &amp; that he was glad that he did.&#160; We said that we were glad that he stopped by to talk with us &amp; to stop by again another time, in the near future, &amp; if he wanted to be a part of the team he would be more than welcomed.&#160; We hope to see him again real soon.&#160; He went back to car after saying "thank you &amp; keep up the good work that you are doing".&#160; Don't worry dear man, we will never stop until they stop killing children.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.minorityreporter.net/article_img/african_american_woman.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="80" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:dshVk4JywMdg7M:http://www.minorityreporter.net/article_img/african_american_woman.jpg" /></a></font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">Martha returned&#160;to praying &amp; I returned to counseling &amp; witnessing, to the public &amp; the victims of Planned Parenthood, the truth about abortion.&#160; I noticed that some one was going into the center so I left Martha out on the sidewalk &amp; I went into the center to help her.&#160; She needed a can of formula (Enfamil LIPIL) for her baby &amp; I so happened to have&#160;this particular brand, that I was saving for Pat's great grandbaby, but I can replace it for her.&#160; I told her that we usually don't have this formula but the good Lord had blessed her today with it.&#160; She smiled &amp; thanked me &amp; went home to feed her precious baby,&#160;that was saved by the grace of God, through one of our male sidewalk counselors, whose been out on the street for 14 years now.&#160; Thank you Lord &amp; please bless him &amp; all of us daily, to preserve until the end, in doing your&#160;pro life work.&#160; I then went back to be with our Martha out on the sidewalk again.</font></strong></p></div><p><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.momist.com/uploaded_images/THE-BLUE-CAR-720080.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="121" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:eX3Mtil-SO3VWM:http://www.momist.com/uploaded_images/THE-BLUE-CAR-720080.jpg" /></a></font></strong></p><div><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">Now hear comes the grand finale, of the afternoon.&#160; I was so thankful that the abortionist, Rachael Phelps, wasn't here today killing little innocent babies, though Martha &amp; I are always on the defensive, for we don't really know or sure&#160;if there isn't a substitute, so we always have our guard up.&#160; I&#160;know that if there is no RU 486 or surgical abortion happening there is always Plan B &amp; other birth control abortions, taking place.&#160; 'A life is a life no matter how small'.&#160; Martha took over the mega phone &amp; was talking into it as I was near the fence eating a fast sandwich that I wolfed down so that I wouldn't faint.&#160; Just as I was about to take the last mouthful, which is usually the case, someone from behind the bushes was hollering back at&#160;her.&#160; I put the&#160;last bit of the sandwich down on the bench &amp; stood up to look in the&#160;parking lot of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I saw no&#160;one &amp; went back to where Martha was standing nearer the&#160;driveway.&#160; Just then a&#160;light blue, expensive looking car, pulled out of the driveway onto the side of the sidewalk where we were standing.&#160; He was taking our picture with his cell phone.&#160; I grabbed a sign so that he could take a picture of the reality of abortion &amp; he quickly stated to me, <font color="#ff6600">"sorry, it's to late",</font> for he got my picture.&#160; I want&#160;to make it clear that I don't mind if people take&#160;my picture, for it is legal, I just want them to take pictures, of the babies that have been killed by abortion, too.&#160; Martha went up to the car window to talk to him.&#160; Lots of luck dear Martha but you go girl, never the less, for she is a former Psych Nurse, that worked in the State Hospital for 15 years, only to retire 3 years ago, so don't mess with her.&#160; I noticed that there was a young child, sitting in a car seat, in the back, so I knew that he was a Dad.&#160; Martha talked to him for a few minutes only to hear his gobbly gook. He told her to go to Conkey Ave. to save lives &amp; she told him that they were killing people here too.&#160; She offered him some free baby clothes &amp; he responded back to her that he wasn't married but he takes care of his own child.&#160; So 'no' to the free clothes then.&#160; I took down his license number &amp; he didn't care in the least.&#160; I told him that he was parking in a 'No Parking' zone but again he didn't seem to really mind.&#160; He just wanted to bug us &amp; saw that we were not&#160;being bugged &amp; that bugged him.&#160; Oh well we can't please everyone!&#160; Later on we were bugged but not at this time, in our encounter with this man, that just didn't get it.&#160; He went for the camera again &amp; just sat there for a few more minutes starring.&#160; He finally left to go down the street &amp; Martha &amp; I were relieved by the lack of his bizarre presence.&#160; I was wrong.&#160; We looked down the street only to see that he was turning around &amp; had now parked in front of the vets, which was not opened for business.&#160; He got out of his car to put some money&#160;into the parking meter, good boy, &amp; then went back into&#160;his car to stare &amp; to take more pictures of us again.&#160; Poor guy, go to the park, or something.&#160; What was this all about?&#160; He did give us the creeps, for in all my 25 years in sidewalk counseling, I don't remember a stockier, there is a first time for everything.&#160; As I was figuring out what to do next I saw walking up the sidewalk a mother with her 6 young children coming towards us.&#160; I went&#160;over to her &amp; said "hello, Brittany" &amp; she said "hello Mary, we've come to do some work in the Material Aid Room for you".&#160; I said "that would be great" &amp; they all followed me into the room, to put some children's clothes away, that were&#160;still in boxes, from earlier today.&#160; I was most grateful for their presence &amp; assistance.&#160; I then went&#160;into the Taxi room to ask big Alan to show himself, out on the sidewalk, maybe&#160;so this guy will know that we really aren't alone &amp; to get out of Dodge quickly &amp; quietly.&#160; But no, not him, he didn't go anywhere but big Alan had to go back to work, answering the phone, at the Taxi company.&#160; Sorry Alan, to drag you into this scenario.&#160; I was now back with Martha &amp; we decided to ignore him for awhile &amp; to continue to pray &amp; to witness.&#160; I saw Dan, a pro life friend of Martha &amp; I, who was dropping off packages,&#160;to the printer store, up the street.&#160; I waved to him to come over to Martha &amp; I,&#160;and he did.&#160; He stopped &amp; I told him what was going on.&#160; He said that he was working &amp; that he would take a picture of him, on his cell phone.&#160; I said "that would be great Dan".&#160; He drove a little ways down the street &amp; stopped the van &amp; took this guys picture &amp; then left to go back to work.&#160;No big deal right.&#160;Wrong.&#160; Later on&#160;I found out that the guy called Dan's boss to report him for taking his picture &amp; Dan was called into the office where his boss chewed him out.&#160; Poor Dan, he was only helping us. Hopefully it will not go any where &amp; he won't be fired.&#160; Please Lord, please protect Dan from this man.&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.badgeplanet.co.uk/badges_large/crazy-person-1.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I said a prayer &amp; then about 5 minutes later a police drive down the street &amp; I went into the street to get the police officer to stop.&#160; He did.&#160; He pulled over &amp; got out of his car &amp; came over to Martha &amp; I.&#160; Martha explained the situation &amp; he said that he would go over to talk to him.&#160; Alleluia!!&#160; He got back into his car &amp; pulled in back of the sitting car with the weird man in it, &amp; got out &amp; walked over to the car.&#160; He spoke with this man for a few minutes.&#160; I saw that a woman walking out of the parking lot of Planned Parenthood with a brown bag in her hands.&#160; I said to her "please don't take the Morning After Pill", thinking that the bag could have this drug in it?&#160; She replied "I don't want anymore kids".&#160; I said quickly "please don't kill the little baby that could be in your womb now".&#160; Off she goes across the street &amp; into the car, of the guy who has been parked there, for over 50 minutes now.&#160; Who would know!!&#160; Martha &amp; I just looked at each other with a 'are you kidding look on our faces.&#160; See he was there to harass us for he should have been in the parking lot of the death mill, waiting for his, murder on her mind, girlfriend, &amp; not sitting in front of the vet's office, for what reason was to cause us anxiety.&#160; The police offer went over to the talk to the other police offer who now has joined him.&#160; The car then pulled away from the curb &amp; drove into Planned Parenthood &amp; I saw that&#160;he had a smirk on his devious face.&#160; As the car was coming out, a few minutes later, I said to&#160;him "please love the baby, who could be in her womb, as you love the baby in the back seat".&#160; Off they went into the world.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; Martha waved to the police officers, who were now driving away &amp; hollered a thank you to them.&#160; They smiled back at us.&#160; What an afternoon!!&#160; </font></strong></div><p><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://comps.fotosearch.com/comp/FSA/FSA904/two-women-whispering_~x13460009.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Martha was going to come a little later.&#160; As I was pulling into our parking lot &amp; noticed that Bill was standing across the street, of Planned Parenthood,&#160;with his signs &amp; that I needed to go over there to tell him that I would be out in awhile.&#160; The moment I arrived there&#160;was a young girl walking to the door of the center &amp; I asked she if I could help her.&#160; She said that she needed a pregnancy test &amp; I said to her "come follow me".&#160; I told her that I needed a few minutes to open up the doors &amp; to set up for the test.&#160; I asked her if she had any children &amp; she said that she had a 1 year old daughter so I said for her to go into the Material Aid Room to get some things for her child &amp; that I would be with her in a few minutes.&#160; As I was doing all this the doorbell rang &amp; it was a young girl asking for some children's clothes.&#160; I was hoping that Martha would come soon for I knew that Suzanne would be coming in about 20 minutes to counsel.&#160; I just prayed that I could do everything,&#160;for I was not feeling well at all.&#160; I was in much pain (chronic pain)which is difficult for me to minister but I pray that the good Lord will help me to help our clients, with love.&#160; I asked her how she knew about us &amp; she said that a friend recommended us to her.&#160; I take her to the Material Aid Room &amp; she &amp; the other girl who was in there getting some things spoke.&#160; Hi was the response to each other.&#160; Here was her friend that recommended us to her.&#160; I said "did&#160;she know that you were here"?&#160; She said "no".&#160; How quaint.&#160; Then said to the first girl that I was ready for her in the Rose Room to do the pregnancy test &amp; left her friend in the Material Aid Room to continue shopping.&#160; What was I suppose to do?&#160; We like to be in there, to assist our mothers, but that's not always possible, &amp; today was the day it was not possible.&#160; I did the test &amp; then counseled our young mother for awhile.&#160; When she left the Rose Room she went back to the Material Aid Room to continue her shopping.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again.&#160; I went to the door to see a young pregnant girl &amp; a guy standing at the door.&#160; I answered the door &amp; said "Samantha".&#160; She said "yes".&#160; "Welcome" I said to her &amp; her friend.&#160; She was the girl that had called me this week asking for baby clothes for her expected baby who is due in August.&#160; The Women's Care Center recommended us to her.&#160; I brought her to the Material Aid Room &amp; had to hurry the 2 other girls for they had time to shop &amp; had a couple of bags for their children already.&#160; I said for them to come back in the future, if they needed anything else, for their children.&#160; They said "okay &amp; thank you" &amp; left.&#160; I was really hoping that Martha would come soon &amp; my prayers were answered in a matter of a few minutes.&#160; Martha came into the room &amp; I greeted her &amp; then introduced her to our new clients. A few minutes after Martha arrived Suzanne arrived.&#160; I introduced her to our new clients &amp; then gave her some instructions of what I needed this afternoon for her to do.&#160; Simple things like ordering brochures &amp; pregnancy tests.&#160;I reviewed the week for her.&#160; I like it when Suzanne calls the clients, the pregnant ones &amp; the ones that have already delivered their babies.&#160; I don't want to take time away from her to do that important work.&#160; I then went back to the Material Aid Room to say good bye to the young couple &amp; told Martha that I was going to the front lines to be with Bill &amp; that I would see her soon.&#160; She said "okay, I'll be out later".&#160; Off I go with the mega phone &amp; picture of Malachi the sweet aborted baby picture &amp;&#160; the box of literature.&#160; I got to the bush side of Planned Parenthood to set up.&#160; I called over to Bill, for he is hard of hearing that I was on the sidewalk now.&#160; I looked over to the Planned Parenthood parking lot &amp; I didn't see the abortionist car parked by the back door.&#160; I was happy but you still can't let your guard down for there could be another abortionist taking her place in there.&#160; Martha joined me on the sidewalk after she was done ministering with our happy young couple.&#160; I hope to see them again, in the future.&#160; </strong></font></p><p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://images.clipartof.com/small/16218-School-Bus-Driver-Man-Driving-School-Children-To-Or-From-School-Clipart-Illustration-Image.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

was walking towards the street.&#160; Martha called her over to us to speak to us by saying "come over hear, sweet girl &amp; talk to us, before you have to get out of the rain".&#160; She walked over to Martha &amp; I.&#160; Martha asked her what she was doing at this terrible place &amp; if she was pregnant.&#160; She said that she was 2 weeks pregnant &amp; was thinking of an abortion.&#160; "Oh no" we both said at once, let's talk to you for a awhile here.&#160; We talked to her &amp; showed her the graphic pictures &amp; all she could say was that some people have to it.&#160; "Oh no" they don't have to do it, "Thou shall not kill" is the universal Commandment of Almighty God, &amp; must be obeyed.&#160; Then she said that she didn't like kids &amp; hated her boyfriend.&#160; I said "get&#160;rid of the boyfriend &amp; keep the baby".&#160; "You don't kill the baby because you hate the father", I said.&#160; She then said that they both agreed, her&amp; her boyfriend,&#160;that it&#160;is what they both wanted to be done.&#160; You can't make these things up.&#160; It's such a heartache for us sidewalk counselors to hear such terrible things against these precious little babies.&#160; We live in a 'throw away' society, if you don't want your baby you just kill he or she before he or she is born, no big deal to these cold hearted &amp; selfish people.&#160; I handed her the Bella movie, for we pass this movie out in tough cases &amp; also our DVD on a bloodless abortion &amp; the growth &amp; development, of the baby in the womb &amp; a testimony, of a former abortion mill owner, Carol Everett,&#160;who has now repented &amp; is saving&#160;lives, instead of taking lives.&#160; I then said to this young girl, for her to look me in the eye &amp; promise me to look at these 2 DVD's, that I just handed to her&#160;&amp; she looked me in the eye &amp; said "yes I will".&#160; She also took a Truth packet &amp; a rubberized 12 week old baby.&#160; Martha kept on talking to her &amp; we told her that we had a pregnancy center right next to the big yellow building &amp; if she needed anything for her&#160;just to call the number on the brochure that was handed to her.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; that she had to go to catch the bus &amp; then she walked up the street to Gibb's &amp; then turned the corner &amp; we saw her no more that day.&#160; Martha &amp; I consoled each other,&#160;from the pain that we were both experiencing, at that moment.&#160; It feels like someone is ripping our hearts out, you can't imagine it hurting so badly.&#160; We cry, we talk, we write, we pray, we&#160;scream, &amp; we have to give it to God, otherwise we will not be able to function &amp; to be ready for the next mother, who might 'chose life' for her sweet baby &amp; need our help.&#160; We must be 'whole' in order to 'help'.&#160;&#160;&#160;Not easy at all.&#160; There is no babies saved if there is no suffering first.&#160; We prayed that this girl would not have the abortion &amp; her baby will be saved from the abortionist cruel hands.</strong>&#160; </font></p><p><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.treehugger.com/yellow-school-bus-photo.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Martha was by her car that was parked on the street by the center &amp; I was coming out of the center &amp; I saw her talking to someone.&#160; I then recognized who she was.&#160; She was the young girl that Martha &amp; I spoke with on Tuesday, trying to save her precious baby from being killed, by abortion.&#160; I was just starting to talk to her when Martha hollered over to me "she did it, she had the abortion 2 days ago".&#160; My heart was sick &amp; I then said a few things to her, as she walked towards Gibbs St. &amp; around the corner she went.&#160; I feel in my heart that when Martha &amp; I was taking to her on Tuesday she had already started the abortion procedure which was RU 486 pills, to kill her baby.&#160; Evil never sleeps.&#160; She will never be the same again no matter how she tries &amp; I only hope &amp; pray that she asks the Lord, who created her &amp; died for her sins, to forgive her &amp; also her baby that she had killed.&#160; Lord have Mercy on her soul &amp; that of her boyfriend, who also will be judged for the murder, of this child of God.&#160; Martha &amp; I grieve for this baby &amp; all the babies that have been slaughtered by abortion.<br /><br />

She was counseled, by Martha,&#160;to go back in there to try again to talk her out of the abortion.&#160; She then said that she was now in the back room, which means the abortion room.&#160; Oh my God, how do&#160;we process that, dear Lord.&#160; This is what Martha said to me when I came out onto the sidewalk,&#160;after being in the center talking with Suzanne, our Thursday counselor, about some things.&#160; Martha also told me that she was being harassed by the neighbors across the street, the two crazies.&#160; They were mocking her &amp; one even pretended to be shooting her.&#160; I wish that she called the police on that one.&#160; Martha had to go baby-sit her grandchildren for the afternoon so she said "good bye" to me &amp; then I took over the sidewalk counseling,&#160;with Tony being there with me, for prayer support.&#160; I lit in like a match, some young girls, who were being brainwashed by the Death Escort, Sylvia Rose &amp; also one of the workers with the gray ponytail.&#160; I wanted the girls to get away from these two evil acting women &amp; not to listen to their hog wash.&#160; It was the mother in me.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://maaadddog.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/choose20life20florida20plates-718837.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Yeah!!!&#160; "We missed you" I told her &amp; that Martha will be disappointed to have missed you today but she will be back next week &amp; she'll see you then.&#160; She mentioned that Florida was very pro life&#160;&amp;

I said "what"!&#160; She then said that she had tried to talk her out of it but she wouldn't listen.&#160; I said then why did you bring her?&#160; She said that she didn't drive her here that she came on her own.&#160; I told her to go in there &amp; talk to her again &amp; to give her this diagram of what the baby looks like &amp; I also gave her the rubberized 12 week old baby too.&#160; Then she said to Carol &amp; I "I have to walk my dog first".&#160; If you think that you have heard it all think again, I could hardly believe my hears when she said that.&#160; I said "put your dog in the car &amp; go in there &amp; try to save the life of your friends baby".&#160; "Go &amp; we will keep you in prayer, what is your first name", I asked.&#160; She turned around &amp; said "Jessica" &amp; left.&#160; I stopped for a moment, for I had named my precious baby girl twin Jessica Rose, that I lost from a miscarriage from the gang rape at Strong Memorial Hospital back in 1971.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; I named my precious boy twin Aaron Joseph, whom I lost in that miscarriage too.&#160; I think of them often but know that they are with God &amp; I will see them someday after I die &amp; be with them for all eternity.&#160; The mothers who abort their children might not&#160;be with their&#160;children, if they don't repent.&#160;&#160;I had to go into the center for a minute &amp; when I came out Carol told me that Jessica never went in &amp; she heard her talking to another girl who was at Planned Parenthood saying "they thought I was going to go in there but I couldn't".&#160; I said where is she now &amp; Carol told me that she was walking her dog .&#160; Unbelievable!!!&#160;&#160; I spotted her in the corner of my eye as she was coming down the sidewalk on my side &amp; as she passed us I said to her "thank you for trying to save your friends baby before she came here but you shouldn't have come here today for it will now bother you the rest of your life that you didn't go back in &amp; try again.&#160; Give it to God to help you.&#160; She went into the parking lot with Muffey, whatever his name,&#160;for it wasn't the poor dogs fault, that his owner brought him to an abortion mill. She drove out about 5 minutes later &amp; was on the cell phone talking to someone.&#160; I'm sure that this will put a strain on their friendship &amp; both of their lives forever.&#160; It's one thing coming to an abortion mill to try to talk someone out of having the abortion than to come to the abortion to walk your dog.&#160; What a mess this Society is in, when animals trump over people's lives.&#160; I feel sorry for her, thanks what abortion does to people it makes them 'walking wounded'.&#160; Carol &amp; I just looked at each other with sadness.</font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">I had to go back into the center, to talk with Suzanne for a moment, &amp; when I came back out a second time Carol had a report from Hell to tell me.&#160; She said that she approached a young girl, who had come out on the sidewalk, &amp; she was told by her that her&#160;sister was in there having an abortion &amp; that she was calling her mother &amp; that&#160;she couldn't stay in there another minute more &amp; had to leave.&#160; Carol said that she was very upset as she walked down the street.&#160; Oh my God what!!&#160; The destroyer is destroying.&#160;&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p></div><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://stopsmoking357.com/uploaded_images/stop-smoking-357-784769.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="53" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:lv1Do6C0lM3gJM:http://stopsmoking357.com/uploaded_images/stop-smoking-357-784769.jpg" /></a></font></strong></p><div><p><strong><font size="4">Carol had to go &amp; Tony had to leave a while ago so I was by myself.&#160; Just then I saw a guy, who came out on the sidewalk&#160;smoking.&#160; I spoke to him in a general way&#160;&amp; he told me to "mind your own business" &amp; after he finished his cigarette, I told him that "I was my brothers keeper". &#160;He then said to me that he was going back in to see how she was doing after the abortion.&#160;&#160;When the car finally did leave the parking lot of Planned Parenthood,&#160;it was the grandmother that was&#160;driving the car, with a smirk on her sick face, &amp; the mother of the baby, that was just killed, was screaming at me &amp; so was the boyfriend as they sped away.&#160;&#160;I have to grieve for all the babies that were killed here today &amp; every day that they are killing these precious, innocent babies.&#160; I have to give it to God.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://s.bebo.com/app-image/7924709420/5411656627/PROFILE/i.quizzaz.com/img/q/u/08/04/04/98426410-blk_bby_grl.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="62" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:NMWlBQrFA5yZmM:http://s.bebo.com/app-image/7924709420/5411656627/PROFILE/i.quizzaz.com/img/q/u/08/04/04/98426410-blk_bby_grl.jpg" /></a></font></strong><strong><font size="4">I went back into the center to be with Melody &amp; to do some work &amp; have some supper together.&#160; I saw a&#160;note that Suzanne had let for me and we had a new baby that was just born.&#160; </font></strong><strong><font size="4">Baby girl R-moni was born May 17th.&#160;weighing&#160;in at 6lbs. 13oz. and 21 inches long. &#160;Mom &amp; baby are&#160;doing&#160;very well, though tired &amp; I'm speaking for the new mom. &#160;Thank God that she' chose life' last year &amp; now can hold her baby in her arms today.

I &amp; took&#160;the sandwiches &amp; cans of lemonade outside, to the from lines. &#160;I decided to eat first &amp; quickly,&#160;then I saw that one of our clients was walking up the sidewalk, she was coming to get the high chair that was given to us by Kelly&#160;that was&#160;dropped off earlier in the afternoon&#160;by Mary S..&#160; The high chair was new &amp; beautiful.&#160; I put the half eaten sandwich down &amp; took our client into the center to give her the high chair &amp; some diapers &amp; other things that she needed for her children.&#160; Just then I heard Martha calling to me at the door saying that a young girl was so upset&#160;&amp;&#160;if I could talk to her.&#160; She was crying &amp; looked real upset so I brought her into the Rose Room to see if I could help her.&#160; She said that she just find out that she was pregnant &amp; was undecided about having an abortion.&#160; She is new to Rochester &amp; is already in a 'program' for a problem that she didn't elaborate on.&#160; The father is a not a nice guy &amp; it was a rebound.&#160; She recently broke up with her boyfriend &amp; he doesn't know&#160;about her one night stand &amp; he was unfaithful too.&#160; They are back together again.&#160; No matter what the situation &amp; how bad it is, abortion is taking the life of a innocent human being &amp; is not acceptable in the eyes of God.&#160; It is always evil.&#160; The situations can change &amp; if they don't you still can't take a life.&#160; I hope with her for 45 minutes &amp; gave her a lot of brochures &amp;&#160;our DVD &amp; the Bella movie.&#160; Also, I gave her the rubberized 12 week old baby.&#160; We saw the Growth&#160; Development DVD in the Rose Room together &amp; at the end of the video she started to smile &amp; look so much better.&#160; I gave her my home &amp; cell phone number &amp; told her that Suzanne &amp; will be calling her to see how she is doing &amp; if she needed anything along the way, in her pregnancy.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; told her that she was not alone &amp; for her to fall in love with her baby that she is carrying.&#160; I also said that once you conceive you will always be the child's mother.&#160; Motherhood starts at conception not at birth.&#160; She left lighter &amp; brighter than when she first came in.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that she will stay strong &amp; not give in to the evil of abortion.&#160; We will keep in touch with her as we do with all of our moms.&#160;I had to re group before I went back to the front lines,&#160;for my emotions were wired, for this was a life &amp; death situation.&#160; I prayed for wisdom from the Holy Spirit to guide me when talking to her.&#160; His grace is sufficient.&#160; Thank you Lord for being with us in the Rose Room.&#160; All is well with my soul.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.skyscanner.com/news/articles/2009/12/03/angry.person.JPG"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

The one guy who was on the bike rode passed us on the street but when it came to his girlfriend that was a different story.&#160; She came up onto the sidewalk &amp; spat on the Malachi sign &amp; then on the back of Tony.&#160; Martha asked what did she think that she was doing spitting on the signs &amp; then said that the babies don't deserve that.&#160; Then she went ballistic.&#160; She then was about to reach for the literature box, probably to throw out all the contents on the sidewalk but Martha retrieved it first.&#160; Then she took her bike &amp; rode through the signs &amp; then Martha took hold of her bike to stop her from doing any more damage, for she was trying to run over Martha with her bike.&#160; Then she&#160;dug her fingernails into Martha, which caused some bleeding.&#160; I got the camera &amp; took her&#160;two pictures of her then I went to take a picture of the boyfriend &amp; he turned around fast &amp; slugged my arm &amp; the camera dropped to the ground but didn't break, thank God.&#160; &#160;I had already snapped his picture before he did that to my arm.&#160; Gotcha!&#160; Smile &amp; say "arrest'.&#160; Carole, was in the street, trying to get the&#160;boy on the bike&#160;to stop&#160;weaving in &amp; out of the street confusing the drivers.&#160; Did he have a death wish or something?&#160; I then called 911 &amp; had a difficult time with the operator, there was noise on the phone &amp; he made me repeat myself many times until I got mad.&#160; Then I noticed that Tony was on his phone talking to a 911 operator too.&#160; What an afternoon.&#160; Finally the two nasty bikers rode down Widler St. &amp; about 5 minutes later two police cars came.&#160; The one police car parked in the driveway, by the entrance way,&#160;of Planned Parenthood &amp; Sylvia Rose the Death Escort asked the police officer&#160;not to stay there for very&#160;long.&#160; He&#160;said that he would be there for just a few minutes.&#160; Do you believe it!!!&#160; While all the commotion was going on Slyvia Rose, with her sun hat on,&#160;came over to the sidewalk &amp; stood there watching us getting harassed by these two bird heads, with a big grin on her evil face.&#160;&#160;Unbelievable!&#160; I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.&#160; The officer took down the report &amp; Martha signed it for she was the one that was injured.&#160; Then the officer went to peruse the victimizers.&#160; Martha had to go to baby-sit &amp; was stressed to the gills.&#160; We said good bye to her &amp; I poured some antibiotic gel on her scratched arm before she left.&#160; She was going to come back&#160;for the Board Meeting at 5:30.&#160; Poor Martha :(&#160;&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://llandudno.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/apples_in_layflat_bag2.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

He came over to us &amp; said "these signs are hard to look at".&#160; We agreed.&#160; Then he tried to challenge us in what we were doing out there.&#160; We explained to him in a calm voice.&#160; He did turn out quite nice after all.&#160; He said that he was a Christian &amp; we said that we were also.&#160; So why are we having this conversation?&#160; Education is the key plus patience.&#160; He started to see what we were all about as the cars were pulling into Planned Parenthood.&#160; It all came together for him.&#160; Then he said something that was very sad.&#160; He said that his friend gave her baby up 16 years ago &amp; was wondering where she was &amp; what was she doing, especially during this time of year as school comes to a close.&#160; She expressed to him that she thought that it would have been better if she had aborted her daughter so that she would know where she was now rather than wondering if she was okay.&#160; Talk about confused.&#160; He did say to her that she needed to see a Psychiatrist &amp; maybe she does.&#160; I said to him "go tell her that&#160;her daughter would rather be in this world right now rather than be dead, no less killed by her mother,&#160;by abortion".&#160; How twisted is her thinking.&#160; You did the right thing by giving her up for adoption &amp; your daughter is more than grateful that you did put her up for adoption rather than abort her.&#160; Oh yea!!&#160; &#160;He stayed to talk to us for a little while longer &amp; I gave him a Truth packet which he first refused but insisted that he take it, which he did.&#160; He also mentioned that another friend of his is a real good person but she has a 'child from a dark place'.&#160; The boy has attacked his mom &amp; was kicked out of private school after 6 months &amp; now resides at Hillside Children's Center, where the abortionist Rachael Phelps once worked, go figure!&#160; The rational was that this child should have been aborted perhaps, only in jest did he say this, which I don't think funny.&#160; A life is created by God &amp; must be protected.&#160; I said we must not play God even though this kid is all messed up, he still is a child of God.&#160; I said that this boy needs lots of prayer.&#160; Hint, hint.&#160; He said good bye &amp; I said that I hoped to see him again sometime.&#160; He said that he would drop by again to talk to us again. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/62572/62572,1207517256,13/stock-photo-a-young-woman-with-red-hair-pulling-her-knees-to-her-chest-and-her-head-down-wearing-cut-off-jeans-11212717.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

The center gives out baby clothes, nursery items, books and small toys, diapers and baby wipes, formula, baby cereal and jars of food, and nonperishable food from the food shelf. The center also accepts such larger items as strollers, high chairs, bassinets, cribs and car seats, as long as they have not been recalled.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The nonprofit center survives on the financial and material donations of a network of supporters, many who are informed through e-mail of its news and needs.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"When I say, 'I need a stroller,' or, 'I need a double stroller,' I get a response," Jost said.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Pregnant women who visit the center often leave with their arms full of pamphlets, DVDs and baby items. The center also collaborates with other area pregnancy centers; for instance, it sends young women to another center for ultrasounds.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The center’s vice president and codirector, Martha Malone, recalls helping to convince a young woman not to go through with an abortion by reciting a powerful poem.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"It was the Holy Spirit," Malone said of why she was able to help the young woman.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The pregnancy center informally keeps track of how many women tell them they have decided not to abort — they say they know of at least 36 babies. They also make follow-up calls to see if the new moms and mothers-to-be have all the items they need. The goal is to help women realize that there are alternatives to abortion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"They are desperate, and no one reaches out," said Malone, a parishioner of St. Theodore in Gates.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Jost and Malone love to tell about the babies born to their clients.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">"They are in our hearts," Jost said.

I greeted her when she came into the center &amp; then I brought her into the Rose Room. She told me that she had 5 children &amp; didn't want anymore. &#160;I prayed to the Holy Spirit for wisdom &amp; then&#160;preceded&#160;to counsel her &amp; to show her the Growth &amp; Development chart &amp; put on the DVD showing the baby in the womb. I&#160;talked&#160;to her about adoption &amp; gave her some brochures about that route to take. &#160;I had my head turned to the literature table to get more information for her when I heard her say "I'm not going to do it". &#160;I turned around &amp; gave her a hug &amp; talked to her some more. &#160;Then I went &amp; got her cousin who was shopping in the Material Aid Room for clothes for her children. &#160;Then our client went into the Material Aid Room &amp; picked up so many&#160;nice&#160;things for her children too. &#160;What a happy moment. &#160;Lots of love flowed in that room at that moment. &#160;It just didn't stop with her it went on &amp; on &amp; on. &#160;My head was spinning but in a good way. &#160;Please pray for baby # 5 for we think that the mom will not go through with the abortion, for her friend was supportive of life &amp; we gave the mom&#160;loads&#160;of information &amp; Martha talked to her that abortion is taking a life. She was too far long to have an abortion at Planned Parenthood today, so was referred to Strong Hospital for a 2nd. trimester abortion. &#160;I did take her ultrasound picture &amp; made a copy, in the center, of this&#160;sweet&#160;baby who is in her womb.</font></strong></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">The other clients who 'chose life' today are scared &amp; I told them that we will be with them to assist them with&#160;their&#160;needs during&#160;their&#160;pregnancy &amp; that they are not alone. They were relieved &amp; smiled. Seeing the reality of the graphic signs, out there on the sidewalk, makes our moms think &amp; then seeing the Growth &amp; Development chart also makes them think. &#160;"You shall know the truth &amp; the Truth will set you free". &#160;We just show them the truth &amp; let the Holy Spirit do the rest.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.gpsmagazine.com/assets/shirts_luv_dad_close.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

And where was the father of this baby?&#160; Only God knows.&#160; Having sex outside of&#160;marriage is&#160;wrong &amp; is a Mortal Sin &amp; must be confessed before one dies, for it is a Deadly Sin, that means that you can end up in Hell for all Eternity, if you die with it on your soul.&#160;&#160;&#160;

I knew that she had taken the packet to comfort herself for the abortion of her grand child, but did she ever look into them for healing.&#160; I gently took the packet out of her hands &amp; opened it up to where the phone numbers of Project Rachel &amp; Lumina were, the&#160;two post abortion ministries, &amp; I&#160;pointed them out to her&#160;&amp; told her to call those numbers to get the help that she needs so desperately.&#160; I also asked her if she had asked the Lord to forgive her for her part in that abortion?&#160; I couldn't understand what she said, for she had an accent, so I said to her again&#160;to ask God to forgive her for her part in the abortion&#160;&amp; He will, I said.&#160; She shook her head ,as if to understand now.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; she was on her way, maybe a little better, than before.&#160; All these years passed by before we got to the 'root of the problem',&#160;maybe because today she was willing to share her story, for the first time.&#160;

"Good" I said.&#160; I gave her lots of information &amp; the DVD &amp; the rubberized 12 week old baby.&#160; She was gitty.&#160; Her sister said that she was in shock.&#160; I said that she was in shock &amp; very happy.&#160; I did teach that sex was reserved for marriage but if a baby is conceived, in the sex act outside of marriage, that&#160;the baby shouldn't be killed, for what the parents did wrong.&#160; They both agreed.&#160; I was happy that the sisters were for life &amp; not for death for this precious&#160;baby.&#160; I asked&#160; her if she had a doctor &amp; she said that she didn't so I gave her our favorite doctors name &amp; she called his office &amp; made an appointment for the next day to see him.&#160; They said that they had a supportive family, which is always good.&#160; I brought them into the Material Aid Room for a yellow onesie, for the baby,&#160;to take home.&#160; I said for them to come back later on when they know, if the one sister, is going to have a little boy or girl.&#160; The sister said "a girl, I want her to have a girl".&#160; I said that it was up to God to decide that.&#160; I smiled at them both &amp; thanked the new mom for 'choosing life'.&#160; They left happy &amp; better educated about what goes on in the womb.&#160; I did a couple of things in the center &amp; then went out to the front lines to be with the troops.</font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.loupiote.com/photos_m/1489569306-blue-wig-girl-hair.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I quickly ate with much speed for you don't know when the door bell will ring &amp; you must be ready, for the next clients either it be a pregnancy test &amp; you have to deal with 'life &amp; death' or handing out baby &amp; children clothes, you just don't know.&#160; Finally I was done with packets &amp; lunch &amp; I went back out to the front lines to give them to the girls to pass out.&#160; When I arrived a young man with a young child in a stroller was walking out of Planned Parenthood &amp; crossing the street.&#160; Donna said that it was William.&#160; Our hearts dropped.&#160; I walked over to him on the other side of the street to speak to him &amp; he re assured me that she wasn't going to have an abortion for this will be his "super boy" &amp; that she was back there to see how far long she was.&#160; Why dear William would you go back to a place that was willing to kill your precious baby last week?&#160; He said because Planned Parenthood was close by to where they lived.&#160; Oh boy!!&#160; I said to him that you don't go back into the mouth of a tiger because he didn't bite you the first time.&#160; So much prayer &amp; education is needed.&#160; It takes time to change, must be patient.&#160; He came back later after his walk &amp; went with his daughter back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; We were afraid that the girlfriend was having an abortion &amp; not letting William know.&#160; That would break his heart &amp; ours.&#160; They came walking out a couple of hours later with her baby still in her womb.&#160; Thank God!&#160; He did say that Planned Parenthood told her that if she wanted the fetus to be sucked out of her then she can come back on Thursday.&#160; Keep away permanently William &amp; girlfriend.&#160; I know that, in my heart, that they will not be back again.&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://blog.kievukraine.info/uploaded_images/2083-767551.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

We took John's van &amp; filled it up to the brim &amp; unloaded it in the Sanctuary, in the center.&#160; We do not pay rent for this space that we are using for storage &amp;&#160;I know that sooner or later the landlord will say something to me about this.&#160; I hope that he will see our need until he rents this space.&#160; He probably wouldn't mind because we storage some things in there already &amp; he knows about that, &amp; he's cool with that,&#160;I just don't want him to say anything for when he does he can be gruff &amp; I'm sensitive. &#160;We pay $1,000 a month for the use of 3 rooms as our center &amp; the use of the all purpose room which anyone in the hallway can use too.&#160; This was on my mind to put the 7 huge containers, filled with children's clothes away tonight, but I forgot that there was&#160;a scheduled dinner &amp; get together that one of our Board members planned for a month.&#160; I was just worried about the landlord at that time &amp; not the meeting.&#160; I was inconsiderate to&#160;the planner&#160;&amp; I upset her, to which I am sorry.&#160; I was stressed for I was out on the front lines &amp; in the center doing pregnancy tests this afternoon. &#160; I just needed to get the children's clothes unpacked &amp;

Abortion is murder even if you don't think so.&#160; I prayed to the Holy Spirit &amp; then went to work.&#160; I put on the Growth &amp; Development DVD &amp; gave her the rubberized 12 week old baby &amp; the Truth packet &amp; the other materials plus our DVD &amp; the movie Bella,&#160;that I thought would be helpful.&#160; I put in a Green Scapular in her bag of literature for conversion.&#160; I brought her into the office to give her more information for public&#160;assistance.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.ns88.com/shop/images/nr-7-inch.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I said "you were always free to go for we don't hold anyone prisoner here but before you go why don't you come with me to the Material Aid Room to get some things for your 2 year old daughter".&#160;

No one knows the pain that we are in when babies are being killed there at Planned Parenthood, ONLY the ones who are out on the front lines know how much it hurts.&#160; I'm not saying that other people don't suffer when they hear of the atrocities of abortion but no one knows the true feeling of loss&#160;when they are killing these precious babies about 100 feet away from where&#160;we are standing &amp; calling out to their mothers &amp; fathers, relatives &amp; friends not to do it &amp; they do it anyway.&#160; The team tried to comfort each other the best way we could but the grieving takes time.&#160; Trust me, it will take a lot of time, some of us are still grieving the losses of last year too.&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://images.clipartof.com/small/16218-School-Bus-Driver-Man-Driving-School-Children-To-Or-From-School-Clipart-Illustration-Image.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="97" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Ne-4yeEMUB49NM:http://images.clipartof.com/small/16218-School-Bus-Driver-Man-Driving-School-Children-To-Or-From-School-Clipart-Illustration-Image.jpg" /></a></font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">Martha had to go to baby- sit but she will be back later on&#160;for supper &amp; work in the center.&#160; The school bus went passed us &amp; gave a long honk, with his&#160;thumb up.&#160; He's our buddy &amp; a breathe of fresh air to us, who are&#160;out on the sidewalk, dealing with 'baby murdering', three&#160;days, of&#160;every week of the year.&#160; His kids on the bus wave at us too.&#160; Just then a kid on a bicycle rode pass me &amp; gave me his IQ,&#160;which is his middle finger, I was glad that Carole had to go into the center for a few minutes to get some water otherwise his finger might fall off too.&#160; It's so discouraging, at times, to think that there are so many evil &amp; misguided people walking around,&#160;but we must keep our hearts &amp; minds&#160;on Jesus, who has conquered death, on the Cross.&#160; There will be a Judgment Day, for all of us &amp; I want to be ready &amp; I hope that others want to be ready for that day too, for we don't know when it will be.&#160; "Now is the acceptable time", thus says the Lord.&#160; That's why I stress the word "repentance" out on the front lines so much.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://chawnghilh.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/praying-hands.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="68" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:3VdFfTZWlR46YM:http://chawnghilh.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/praying-hands.jpg" /></a></font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">Another young girl went into the center for a pregnancy test &amp; Suzanne greeted her.&#160; Melody &amp; her friend were kept busy making up Truth packets &amp; brought them out to the girls on the sidewalk, to give away.&#160; After this young girl came out of the center Betty was walking into the center so I asked if Betty would pray with her in the parking lot for a few minutes.&#160; She happily did so.&#160; Later on Betty told me that she wanted her to pray for a baby &amp; Betty asked if she was married &amp; the young girl said "no" that she wasn't married, so Betty being a good Christian, told her that she could,'t pray for that because she wasn't married.&#160; You don't pray to God, to commit a sin, to get what you want &amp; that's what sex outside of marriage is.&#160; ex outside of marriage is fornication &amp; is a 'Serious Sin' called a 'Deadly Sin' or 'Mortal Sin' that if not confessed, can land you in Hell, for all Eternity.&#160; 'No Organisms in Hell'.&#160; Non martial sex is not worth going to Hell for. </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://chamberofsecrets89.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/anger.gif"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="81" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:zUjI6nW9J2ZWeM:http://chamberofsecrets89.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/anger.gif" /></a></font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">As I was walking back to the front lines, there came out of Planned Parenthood, William &amp; his girlfriend &amp; young daughter, in the stroller.&#160; They were walking up the street towards E.

to wait for the police to come.&#160; "I'd go to jail for your baby, if I have to", I said. &#160;Then he hollered to the people standing outside of the Enterprise building, across the street,&#160;saying "what are you looking at".&#160; The girlfriend told him to remember that he was on probation &amp; he told her to "shut up", where did the love go?&#160; "I don't care" was his response".&#160;&#160;He looked at me with such rage &amp; said "I bet that you're not married or have any children &amp; are lonely, lonely, lonley".&#160; I replied back saying to him "William you have the Rosary that we gave you around your neck".&#160; He froze on the spot.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.howtobecomesomething.com/images/how-to-become-a-police-officer.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

started to ask me questions.&#160; William told the officer that he was the one that called him &amp; not me.&#160; So the officer asked him what this was all about.&#160; William replied that I was following him from down the street.&#160; I looked on the officer's face, he didn't know to process this one.&#160; "What", he said, &#160;"that's not illegal&#160;to follow some one up the street".&#160; Just then another police officer came by on his bicycle &amp; two other officers, in their cars.&#160; I looked at the officer &amp; said "hello officer Chris".&#160; "Hello Mary" was the reply.&#160; Then the other officer told William &amp; the woman to go on their way &amp; off they went.&#160; Officer Chris didn't admonish me, in my decision to confront William, with the question that I had asked him. &#160;I told Chris what&#160;they had done at Planned Parenthood &amp;&#160;he said "another member less in that family", I said "yes".&#160;&#160; I started to cry &amp; he told me to go back to the center &amp; try to relax.&#160; I said that now I have to tell the team that William's girlfriend, did have the abortion, for there wasn't any second guessing any longer.&#160; I said "thank you officer Chris" &amp; I thanked the other police officers&#160;&#160;too.&#160; One of the people from across the street said that they called the police for me, for they saw that he was blocking me, in the driveway.&#160; I said "thank you, I appreciate that&#160;&amp; have a great day" &amp; off I went back to the center to tell everyone the bad news.&#160; This loss is going to take awhile to heal, for me &amp; for the team.&#160; It became so personal because we had engaged William so many times &amp; bonded with him, in the fight to save his baby's life, only for him to give in to this evil of murder, of his little one.&#160; How do I process this dear Lord?&#160; I did go to Confession,&#160;the next day,&#160;&amp; in that Sacrament I did ask the Lord to forgive me for stopping my car, in the middle of the street, &#160;that was dangerous &amp; I could have caused an accident &amp; could have hurt or even had killed someone, by my rash judgment to follow William, up the street.&#160; Lord have&#160;Mercy on my soul.&#160; God forgives, I wish people would.&#160;

What's next?&#160; It must have happened yesterday when the Monday night counselor brought some people in the room.&#160; He trusted them &amp; they shouldn't have taken the candy, if they did.&#160;All I know that it was there on Saturday, when I filled the dish up, with candy.&#160;&#160;Who would figure that would happen?&#160; Lately we have had a&#160;lot a thievery, how sad.&#160; Our plastic baby model, hand cream, stuffed animals, in the bathroom &amp; now the candy dish, nothings sacred!!&#160; We will be having a new counselor coming in on Monday, next week.&#160; Our sidewalk counselor, has done an excellent job, &amp; it is so hard to be on the street &amp; in the center, at the same time.&#160; He is to be commended.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Melody just came in, so I introduced Dominique to her.&#160; I decided to go back outside to be with the team.&#160; Melody &amp; Dominique were&#160; chatting &amp; then they went into the Material Aid Room to sort out baby clothes &amp; then they were&#160;planning to go&#160;into the office, to make up Truth packets, which is Melody's favorite thing to do.&#160;

stopped along side of Martha &amp; I on the sidewalk.&#160; Carole was now standing across the street holding a "Planned Parenthood Kills Babies' sign &amp; Donna was up the street, holding our sweet aborted baby, Malachi sign.&#160; We had the Killing Mill covered.&#160; I put my head into the car window &amp; started to talk to her.&#160; The driver then said to me that she was going to have an abortion.&#160; My heart dropped but I might pick it up again real fast, in order to talk this mother out of, killing her baby.&#160; Martha was talking to her now while I went over to the literature box to get a Truth packet &amp; a rubberized baby at 12 weeks &amp; our DVD &amp; our brochure &amp; the doctors list &amp; another Rosary.&#160; I got these things in less than 10 seconds, for&#160;I didn't want her to drive away without them.&#160; I handed all the information to the passenger, in the car,&#160;&amp; then begged&#160;the woman who was driving that&#160;said that she was going to&#160;have an abortion,&#160;not to have her baby killed.&#160; The woman said that she has 3 children &amp; Martha told her that she had 5 children &amp; it didn't kill her.&#160; She asked me if she had my contact information &amp; I pointed to my name &amp; phone # in the brochure.&#160; I also wrote down my cell number for her to call me if she needed to.&#160; She smiled &amp; then said "thank you" &amp; drove away.&#160; I feel that in my spirit that she will not go through with the abortion.&#160; Please dear Lord please.&#160; She also saw the graphic signs, that we have on the front lines,&#160;which does have an affect on some woman &amp; they have changed their minds &amp; don't have the abortion &amp; went on to have their precious baby.&#160;&#160;Praise God!!!&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://hci.arc.nasa.gov/pages/Guy.JPG"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

to see if Melody &amp; Dominique needed anything.&#160;I also got the lunch bag for Martha &amp; I.&#160; We start to feel faint around this time of day.&#160; When I got back outside I saw that Martha was talking to a young man with many tattoos on his arms.&#160; I got involved with the conversation.&#160; It sounded like his girlfriend was in Planned Parenthood having an abortion &amp; he wasn't sure if it was his.&#160; I said that doesn't make any difference but he said that it was to late for she has been there for a long time &#160;now.&#160; I then said to him that it was sad that he drove her in here to do this&#160;terrible thing.&#160; He looked at me &amp; said that he was to young to drive.&#160;&#160;What!!&#160; &#160;He then asked us if we had a cigarette.&#160; "No" was our reply.&#160; Are you kidding!!&#160; Martha was trying to give him post abortion literature but I didn't feel comfortable with that.&#160; I said "do you believe in God"? &#160;He said "I believe in God" then he rolled up his sleeve &amp; showed us his tattoo, of a cross.&#160; This is not happening!!&#160; I said to him that this&#160;was a sad day for&#160;him &amp;&#160;his girlfriend &amp; then he walked back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Carole hollered over to us, from across the street, that he had been talking to the Death Escort, for a very long time, when he came over to talk Martha.&#160; What a messed up kid.&#160; A few minutes later he &amp; his girlfriend came out &amp; they went to their car.&#160; They stood there in the parking lot, next to their car, for a few minutes, while I ranted &amp; raved to them what she just had just done. &#160;I saw that they both had a smile on their faces &amp; then I saw that they were walking towards Martha &amp; I, on the sidewalk.&#160; They came around the bushes &amp; there they were in front of Martha &amp; I.&#160; She saw the graphic sign, of the aborted baby, &amp; said "how sad was that picture".&#160; I said "did you do that to your baby here today"?&#160; She was hesitant but then said "no".&#160; Martha asked if she was pregnant &amp;, as she was smoking her cigarette, she replied "yes".&#160;&#160;Finally we got some truth here, no more&#160;'Game Playing'&#160;I hope.&#160; I looked over to the young man &amp; said that I forgave him for what he was pulling on us &amp; that it wasn't very funny but sick.&#160; I then asked her why was she there.&#160; She said that she was there to see how far long she was.&#160; That could be good or bad.&#160; Sometimes they want to know,&#160;so they can&#160;have an abortion, &amp; then other times they just want to know how far along they are.&#160; I suggested that they go to Compass Care, for an ultrasound,&#160;&amp; for them to help her to&#160;stop&#160;smoking. too.&#160; I asked if she would like&#160;me to make the initial call &amp; then I would give her the phone to make the appointment.&#160; She agreed.&#160; I called Compass Care &amp; told them who I was &amp; that I had a young girl that would like to make an appointment, for an ultrasound.&#160; She took the phone &amp; made the appointment, for the next day.&#160; After she hung up she said that she was going back into Planned Parenthood to cancel the appointment, for the ultrasound, today.&#160; Martha &amp; I encouraged her to just go home &amp; that she didn't need to go back into Planned Parenthood to cancel the appointment or just call them on your way home.&#160; But she insisted that she wanted to go back in to cancel the appointment.&#160; I said that they sell abortions to young girls who are afraid &amp; vulnerable but they went back in there anyway.&#160; I hope that she's not playing games with us too.&#160; We noticed that they didn't come out until about an half an hour later.&#160; As they were driving away, for she was the one driving, I asked her if she was going to keep her appointment tomorrow &amp; she nodded back to me "yes".&#160; We hope &amp; pray that she does, for her &amp; her baby's sake.&#160; What a mixed up boy &amp; girl.&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://treesflowersbirds.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/rain.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Well, about an hour later the phone rang,&#160;it was her &amp; she said that her doctor had put her on disability &amp; that she wasn't coming back, for the 20 hours per week, but that she would come back next week to help out for a few hours.&#160;

I knew that the client was pregnant.&#160; I later found out that it was the girlfriend that was crying, to the good news, of her girlfriend.&#160; Then the client was crying due to the fact that she will have to face her Aunt, who she is living with.&#160; We offered her that we would go,&#160;to be with her as she tells her Aunt, if she wants one of us to.&#160; We will do whatever it takes to save a life.&#160; I went into the Rose Room to offer my assistance &amp; gave her some support &amp; a DVD &amp; some brochures on Adoption &amp; care of her baby.&#160; After things settled down a bit we went into the Material Aid Room to get something for her to bond with her baby, who is alive &amp; in her womb.&#160; We will follow up on this client as we do our other clients weekly, through Suzanne, who is our Thursday afternoon counselor, who tries to get through the files to see how our clients are doing &amp;

&#160;I brought her into the Rose Room for a pregnancy test &amp; it was positive.&#160; She was surprised &amp; told&#160;me her story.&#160; It's usually complicated &amp; that saddens me so much.&#160; When you have sex your chances of getting pregnant&#160;is there because that's how you get a baby is through sex.&#160; So many girls have sex &amp; don't think that they could get pregnant.&#160; Most of the guys are not around or are&#160;incarcerated &amp; if they get out &amp; find that the baby isn't theirs they force her to have an abortion, which is murder.&#160; They leave her anyway &amp; then she suffers from Post Abortion Stress Syndrome that no one talks about especially Planned Parenthood, which is bad for business, &amp; the modern medical world who makes $$$ off of the abortion, through doctor visits &amp; the pharmaceutical companies, for the anti depressants that the doctors prescribes for her depression &amp; anxiety.&#160;&#160;It goes full circle &amp;

Just before I left to go out, the doorbell rang &amp; it was a young lady wanting baby clothes, so I told Suzanne &amp; she took it from there.&#160; It's always good to have a counselor, in the center, when we are out on the front lines, so that we don't have to be in both places at once.&#160; When I got out there I spoke with the girls &amp; we decided to go see, one of our own who was in the hospital, after supper, this evening.&#160; Then Carole handed me $50, for the center, she said that she won&#160; $100 at Bingo &amp; gave the center half of that.&#160; Thanks Carole that was so nice of you.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color="#000000" size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.essex1.com/people/paul/goodnbn2.gif"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

then I asked&#160;</font></strong><strong><font color="#000000" size="4">Suzanne if she had any news of any of our babies that were 'saved', if they were born yet?&#160; <font color="#003366">She said&#160;"I</font><font size="+0"><font color="#003366" size="4">&#160;have good news &amp; bad news".</font><font size="+0">&#160; "Oh </font></font><font size="4">no", I thought.&#160; I then said to her "what is the good news first".&#160; She said that one of our clients ,who was referred&#160; to Dr. N., kept her appointment &amp; likes him &amp; will be using him for her pre natal care".&#160; "Yeah" I answered back!!&#160; "Now for the bad news" I said.&#160;&#160;I know what it&#160;is, when she said "I have bad news for you".&#160; She then said that the woman that I spoke to last Friday aborted &amp; she wasn't sure if it was on Thursday or Friday, of&#160;last week.&#160; I know that it wasn't&#160;last week&#160;because she was pregnant when I met her &amp; her boyfriend, for she showed me her stomach &amp; she had a small pouch protruding &amp; said that she was 9 weeks along.&#160; This is the story.&#160; Last week I went to the dentist,&#160;next to&#160;St. Mary's Hospital, &amp; after that I decided to go to the center to do some work there.&#160; I arrived around 3:10 pm &amp; after awhile in the center I decided to go outside to Planned Parenthood to see how many cars were in the parking lot.&#160; When I arrived I saw that the abortionist wasn't there but there were 2 people talking, a man &amp; a woman, in the parking lot.&#160; I called them over to me &amp; they came.&#160; I spoke to them for a few minutes &amp; then offered them some literature &amp; invited them to come with me to the center to get them.&#160; They followed me into the Focus Center.&#160; I again spoke with them about many things.&#160; She was nice &amp; seemed to be a Christian &amp; he gave me a hard time with many questions about Christianity, which I answered through the power of the Holy&#160;Spirit.&#160; She became irritated with him saying "What, you don't know that Jesus is the&#160;son of God"!!&#160; I asked her what she was doing at Planned Parenthood &amp; she said for pre natal care.&#160; I told&#160;them about their Racism &amp; gave&#160;them&#160;the Truth packet &amp; the DVD on Growth &amp; Development &amp; Maafa 21: Black Genocide in the 21st. Century.&#160; Also our 12 week old rubberized baby &amp; our list of good doctors to&#160;go to.&#160; I invited them into the Material Aid Room to get some green &amp; yellow&#160;baby clothes &amp; she showed me her bulging belly at that point.&#160; At the end of&#160;our time together I&#160;asked if they had a Bible.&#160; He said that he has a Koran &amp; she said that she would&#160;like a Bible so I went into the Rose Room to get one for her.&#160; On the way out I asked her to write down her name &amp; phone number on the Intake Sheet &amp; if it was okay with her, that&#160;Suzanne our counselor, would call&#160;her to see if&#160;she &#160;needed anything.&#160; "That's fine" she answered back.&#160; As&#160;the boyfriend&#160;was leaving he&#160;turned around to me &amp; said that he was a Muslim.&#160; "Okay" I said back &amp; have a nice day.&#160; He earlier stated that he believed in Science &amp; not Religion &amp; said&#160;many weird things.&#160; I asked her if he was her husband or boyfriend&#160; &amp; she said "boyfriend".&#160; He watched to many bad movies like the Di Vinci Code &amp; I told him that.&#160; Needless&#160;to say I was very surprised to hear that she had an abortion.&#160; When Suzanne called her she thought that it was Planned Parenthood &amp; said that she was still bleeding.&#160; Suzanne handled the phone call very well.&#160; This, like&#160;all our lost babies, was a heart break.&#160;&#160;I pondered this over &amp; over in my head.&#160; It was to late, last Friday &amp; the&#160;abortionist wasn't there &amp; she&#160;looked pregnant, so why in the name of Heaven did she&#160;come back on probably Tuesday, to have an abortion,&#160;when she wasn't even abortion minded, on Friday???&#160; Only God knows what happened to have someone do this terrible act of violence against another human being, especially one's own child, that God so fearfully &amp; wonderfully created.&#160; I was sick &amp; puzzled, to boot about this, or hearing the news of any precious, innocent baby being killed.&#160; <a id="thumbnail" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/3050575269_9a260e8a0b.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="58" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ehD5afld6w2QKM:http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/3050575269_9a260e8a0b.jpg" /></a></font></font></strong></p></div><font color="#000000"><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><strong>I went&#160;back to the front lines carrying this pain with me.&#160; Martha told me that 3 young girls were heading towards Planned Parenthood &amp; were informed about the Truth.&#160; The two girls, out of the three, did not go into Planned Parenthood to get anything but the hard noised one did.&#160; &#160;When she came out she showed Martha &amp; Carole &amp; Betty her condoms.&#160; Oh what a catch!&#160; You'll be the only one with a sexually transmitted disease or get pregnant &amp; what, come back here to the people that care for you (not), &amp; have them kill your sweet baby.&#160; Hope not with all&#160;our hearts.&#160; Some of our girls are soooo hard but we love them never the less only to worry about them, a little more than the others.&#160; We wouldn't be out there taking so much disappointment &amp; hatred &amp; chaos if we didn't love them &amp; their children but especially the dearly offended Lord &amp; Savior.&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://wordincarnate.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/silhouette-of-woman-praying.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 63px; float: left; height: 82px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="59" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:9O-fF5WIRfG6gM:http://wordincarnate.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/silhouette-of-woman-praying.jpg" /></a></strong></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>We came in around 5pm to set up for supper &amp; then went to <img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 53px; float: left; height: 59px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="62" height="80" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Zflq7KDBJOKKNM:http://fancyflours.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/ice-cream-cone.jpg" />Strong to visit our dear friend.&#160; Thank God that I had my 3 friends with me, for I was near the very building that, the gang rape took place back in 1971, at Strong Memorial Hospital.&#160; It was&#160;in the Research Center.&#160; They gave me their love &amp; support &amp; prayers,&#160;after the visit of our friend,&#160;in the Abbots parking lot&#160;on Mt.

When I first arrived, one of the seasoned pro lifers, was already there.&#160; He came out of the center to tell me that we already had a client that was in the Material Aid Room getting things for her child.&#160; I walked into the room &amp; said "hello".&#160; I knew that Martha was right behind me for we came to the center right after Mass &amp; I saw her park her car on the street, where she won't get hit.&#160; I went into the office &amp; I saw that&#160;the red light was blinking, on the phone, which means that I had a &#160;message.&#160; I knew also that the other pro lifer was going to get things set up on the sidewalk &amp; would sidewalk counsel, so I didn't have to worry about the coverage on the front lines &amp; also I knew that Mary S. &amp; Donna come at this time &amp; would be with him on the sidewalk, as Martha &amp; I would be in the center, for awhile.&#160; &#160;I took the phone message &amp; it was Sandy, calling in today, for she wasn't feeling well.&#160; Sorry to hear that.&#160; We are short one person now.&#160; Just then my cell phone went off &amp; it was Betty saying that she was a patient at the Strong Hospital.&#160; What next, I'm afraid to pick up any more phones.&#160; She had a non life threatening health problem &amp; will be home on Friday, thank God,&#160;&amp; will be back at the center next Tuesday.&#160; That sounds good to me Betty.&#160; She requested to stay in the center &amp; not to go outside on the front lines.&#160; Understandable.&#160; I know was in the hallway &amp; heard the doorbell so I went to answer it as I passed the Material Aid Room I saw that Martha was in the room helping our mom, which I knew that she would.&#160; We have this quiet understanding with each other.&#160; I went to the door &amp; there was our client that "Chose Life".&#160; I said "hi dear one it is so good to see you, I thought that you said that you were coming in on Thursday but that's okay I'm glad to see you today".&#160; And then I&#160;gave her a big hug. &#160;I said that because I know that Suzanne, our counselor on Thursdays, would love to have seen her too.&#160; I brought her &amp; her&#160;two friends into the Material Aid Room.&#160; Martha was pleased to have seen her too.&#160; One of her friends requested a pregnancy test but needed some water to help make that possible.&#160; So Martha went to get her a bottle of water in the office refrig.&#160; I asked our client how she was doing &amp; she said that she was doing fine &amp; that her baby was due now in August &amp; not in September.&#160;&#160;Great!!&#160; I asked if she need anything &amp; she said a bassinet.&#160; I said "are you kidding me, we have a beautiful bassinet in the back room but it's blue &amp; you're having a girl".&#160; "That's okay" she said so I said "okay lets go get it".&#160; Once she saw it she was so happy, even if it was blue, who really cares, right.&#160; The smile on her face was priceless.&#160; Just then Donna came in to use the bathroom &amp; saw us together talking &amp; she came over to us &amp; said "so you're having a boy".&#160; Are you kidding me.&#160; Our sweet client just smiled &amp; said "no I'm having a girl".&#160; It has already started.&#160; But that's okay, for it was free &amp; beautiful.&#160; Her baby daughter won't be affected in the least by everyone thinking that she is a boy or I should say I hope not.&#160; I was so happy that our client was happy.&#160; I told her to come back if she needed anything else &amp; that I wanted to see the baby after she was born &amp; for her to bring her in for us t see.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; Great!!&#160; Her friend took the pregnancy test &amp; was counseled by Martha &amp; off they went, very happy, all 3 of them.&#160; See you soon :)</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://nikkishell.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfaf553ef01156fc0ac08970c-800wi"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

There was another mother wanting baby&#160;&amp; children's clothes.&#160; Martha brought her into the Material Aid Room &amp; I went into the office, to do somethings, before going out to the front lines, to&#160;join the team.&#160; After Mass today Paula gave us 2 huge bags of clothes, that was now in the general meeting room, to be put away hopefully by Melody when she comes in today &amp; also Mary S. when she came today, to be on the front lines during her lunch hour, gave us 3 bags full of clothes too.&#160; Thanks you guys.&#160; Melody will be very busy when she&#160;gets here&#160;today.&#160; Martha was still in the Material Aid Room so I went in to help her but the door was locked.&#160; I knocked on the door &amp; Martha let me in.&#160; It was the 3 year old little girl that locked the door &amp; when I said "no honey , don't lock the door" I got a look that would make your hair curl.&#160; Oh boy!&#160; Another mother was now in the room too with her son.&#160; All I know is that someone, had pulled off all my flower stickers, that I had&#160;put on the wooden shelves, where I have the baskets of clothes.&#160;That's the price that you pay&#160;when you&#160;give out 'free clothes'.&#160; It gets so busy, in the room, that it's hard to watch everyone&#160;&amp; kids can be fast.&#160; I forgive whoever did that to my beautiful room.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.drhavinga.co.za/Kopluise/lice.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I got there first &amp; saw that a young man was sitting on the bench in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I called over to him &amp; offered him help &amp; told him what Planned Parenthood was all about (the short version) &amp;

Just then a woman was walking towards Planned Parenthood &amp; I&#160;told her about the racism there but she walked in there anyway.&#160; How sad!&#160; Then the&#160;school&#160;bus driver honked at us with all his gusto &amp; the kids in the school bus waved.&#160; It was so good an experience for us who are so abused, at times.&#160; "Blessed are the persecuted for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven".&#160; Yeah!!!&#160; I had to go back into the center, to talk to Suzanne about something, &amp; I left Martha &amp; John &amp; Bill to do what they do best &amp; that is to witness.&#160; When I came back out,&#160;I need to stop doing that, for whenever I leave &amp; come back out, there is usually a problem.&#160; I saw that the woman that I had confronted before I went into the center was arguing with Martha &amp; John.&#160; I went to get my sign, to stand on the sidewalk to witness but when I heard what she was saying &amp; reacted.&#160; She said that she was pro choice &amp; that it was her body.&#160; I told her that she was "pro death" &amp; why would you do that to your body"?&#160; Then she said that she wasn't Black, okay you're Afro American, sorry.&#160; Still&#160;Planned Parenthood is targeting you as a Race.&#160; Then she&#160;started to do a Praise the Lord dance, saying Alleluia.&#160; I&#160;said that you can do that only after you repent first for thinking that it's okay to&#160;kill God's children, through abortion.&#160; Bill came over, from across the street,&#160;&amp; their faces were inches apart,&#160;to close for comfort, so I faked calling the police to get her off of the sidewalk.&#160; It worked.&#160; It usually does work, but&#160;there were two times that the guys were so arrogant, that they stayed to greet the police, that never came.&#160; But this is a good tactic to avoid any altercations, on the sidewalk.&#160;&#160;Off she goes, walking down the sidewalk,&#160;still defending her right to kill her baby.&#160; Not!!&#160; Sometimes you just can't get through to them.&#160; As she was walking away, there&#160;was Jim Bovay, the neighbor who lives across the street from the abortion mill, standing on the sidewalk across the street, just looking at me with his beedy eyes.&#160; Do you believe it!&#160;&#160;I don't.&#160; We have been trying to convert him &amp; the other neighbors, for the past 14&#160;years to no avail, that they are killing littler babies at Planned Parenthood &amp; that you should be doing something about it, like protesting with us.&#160; Brain dead.&#160; No one home <strong><font size="4">mentality. </font></strong>There he is standing,&#160;across the street, like a board just looking at me.&#160; Then he&#160;says "Mary you're crazy".&#160; Then John&#160;hollers over to him&#160;"then we're all crazy too".&#160; Then Jim&#160;spins his hand, by his head, to&#160;imply that I'm nuts.&#160; No Jim the word is out that it's you that's nuts.&#160; Anyone who believes that abortion, which is the slaughter of the innocent is okay, then they are ready for the funny farm.&#160; I'll drive.&#160; How sad is this.&#160; I asked him to "go away" &amp; he did, back into his own world of denial.&#160; It must be lonely there, oh no&#160;I forgot, he has his wife Sue &amp; the&#160;rest of the neighbors to keep him company.&#160; Icky!&#160;&#160;&#160;Misery loves company, so they say.&#160; I was glad that this old&#160;tart was&#160;gone.&#160; Yes, it got heated out there on the sidewalk, with this girl that was being convicted by her own words.&#160; It's funny, that a little noise bothers him, but not the killing of little, innocent babies, across the street, from where he lives.&#160; Something is wrong with this&#160;picture, that's for sure.&#160; </strong></font></p></div><div><font size="4"><strong>&#160;<a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.wesleymc.com/CPM/black%20mom%20and%20infant.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

Sounds right to me to describe what all the death escorts, abortionist &amp; staff are doing at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Depraved &amp; perverted behavior in killing 'little people'.&#160; One of the pro lifers asked if I could be sued for slander saying this to him.&#160; No, I don't think so, for it applies.&#160; The Truth is the Truth &amp; this is the Truth.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://norman.walsh.name/2003/06/18/images/truck.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="106" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:RgFUZ5GKjU4PoM:http://norman.walsh.name/2003/06/18/images/truck.jpg" /></a>A truck parked in front of the Planned Parenthood's building, right in front of the brick side, in back of another car.&#160; She got out &amp; put some money in the meter &amp; then walked into Planned Parenthood, while walking she gave me the 'bird'.&#160; I said "please don't show me your IQ, for we are here to help you for you are going into a place that&#160;kills&#160;children".&#160; Off she goes into the building.&#160; She came out about 15 minutes later &amp; I tried to talk to her again &amp; she shows her IQ again for a longer time, this time.&#160; I pleaded with her for she was caring a brown paper bag, which could mean condoms or the Morning after Pill, which acts as an abortificiant which(kills a person earlier on).&#160; I could tell by her 'body language that I was getting no where with her.&#160; She got into her truck &amp; then I heard a noise.&#160; I said to the male pro lifer "I think that she just hit the car that's in front of her, just now".&#160;&#160; He said in a nervous voice "that's my car!" &amp; started to run over to see what damage, that had possibly been done, to his car.&#160; I walked over to be with him.&#160; He told her that she just had hit his car &amp; bent over to see if there was any damage done to it.&#160; It didn't look like that there was, thank God.&#160; I had a Truth packet with me &amp; the male pro lifer asked her if she would take it &amp; she said "okay" &amp; took the packet.&#160; I said to her that they are killing children in there &amp; I get a little emotional, as a woman, so forgive me if I was hard on you.&#160; I told her about the Morning after Pill &amp; she said that she was in there for condoms &amp; that they told her that she could get 'free birth control'.&#160; I said that there was a lot of information, in the packet that will educate her about birth control.&#160; She said that her past boyfriend was in jail &amp; they broke up &amp; she need the condoms for her new boyfriend.&#160; Then she said that she was once a Catholic, not sure why she mentioned that but we addressed that too.&#160; The pro lifer said that there was a Rosary in the packet &amp; for her to start to say it &amp; I mentioned for her to go to the Sacrament of Confession.&#160; She smiled a little smile &amp; then said "is everything okay now to the male pro lifer"?&#160; He said that his car was fine.&#160; So she smiled at him &amp; said to him "thanks".&#160; Off she went back into the world a more educated person who now has a 'second chance', with her life &amp; soul.&#160; See how God works, it's amazing!!!</font></strong></p></div><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p>

After she came back I went back into the center to see how things were going.&#160; About 10 minutes later Martha was in the center &amp; with her were a pregnant woman &amp; a man &amp; a beautiful little girl.&#160; She brought them into the Rose Room &amp; the Material Aid Room, for a stroller.&#160; What happened was they went into Planned Parenthood to get some information regarding pre natal doctors &amp; were told, as they were going in, by the death escort&#160; "not to listen to those crazy people out there".&#160; Who are you talking about 'death escort'?&#160; Don't talk about yourself that way.&#160; When they came out Martha interceded &amp; lead them to the Focus Center to assist them.&#160; The pregnant woman told Martha that she was told by the woman at the front desk, in Planned Parenthood,&#160; that all they were doing today were termination's.&#160; My heart was sickened by that comment.&#160; So casual in saying that all they were doing today was ending the lives of innocent, voiceless defenseless children.&#160; How sick, How evil!!!&#160; Martha assisted this family &amp; got her connected to a good doctor who will see her tomorrow morning with her high risk pregnancy.&#160; They went back into the Material Aid Room to get some things for their precious daughter to take with them.&#160; Out the door they go, with their new stroller &amp; very happy that they were well taken care of, in a place that doesn't kill babies.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://brog.engrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/danger-educated-black-woman.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; width: 57px; float: left; height: 81px; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="45" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:HQjlMG8a6kx8bM:http://brog.engrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/danger-educated-black-woman.jpg" /></a>Martha &amp; I were now back on the front lines &amp; prayed &amp; sidewalk counseled. We took the abuse of the people going in &amp; out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I spoke to a woman who a young son in the back seat of the car &amp; as she was going into the driveway she said to me "I have a young son in my car".&#160; I said "then you shouldn't be bringing him into this abortion mill".&#160; She got out of her car &amp; came around the bushes to where Martha, John &amp; I were standing.&#160; I prayed t be ready to confront her &amp; there she was right on the sidewalk now.&#160; She said "I ask you not to say anything for my son is with me".&#160; I offered her the Maafa 21: Black Genocide in the 21st. Century, DVD. She said "if I take it then will you not say anything to my son &amp; I when I walk back into the parking lot".&#160; I said "yes, if you take &amp; watch this DVD we'll not say anything to you &amp; your son".&#160; "Okay" she said &amp; she took it &amp; walked back into the parking lot &amp; as she was turning the corner she said "I just want you to know that I agree with you", then left.&#160; We honored her request &amp; they finally left about 20 minutes later.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she keeps her promise &amp; watches the DVD.&#160; Amen sister.&#160; Please don't come back to Planned Parenthood again with your son.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://musiclab.atu.edu/images/DVD.png"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I asked him if he wanted a Rosary, we began to talk &amp; Martha offered him the Maafa 21 DVD &amp; he took it &amp; said that he &amp; his friends will watch it.&#160; Hopefully so, what a surprise it will be for you &amp; your friends.&#160; One DVD at a time to educate &amp; to change the minds of the people, through the grace of God.&#160; Sooner or later someone will get the message that Planned Parenthood is killing off the Black Race &amp; will do something about it in a peaceful way, like organizing a huge protest against Planned Parenthood, held over 100 days, right in front of the building 24/7.&#160; The media would pick up on the story &amp; it would be covered on all local TV channels &amp; the Democrat &amp; (liberal) Chronicle, would do a story on the front page &amp; it would be a fair &amp; balanced article, a page long, telling what Planned Parenthood does, like kills people &amp; not reporting statuary rape &amp; targeting the Black Race (Black Genocide) &amp; are sex perverts, check out their Teen Wire web site, which would make your hair curl.&#160; Where is every one?&#160;

Martha did the pregnancy test &amp; as she was in the Material Aid Room getting some things for her other children, I asked her how she found out about us.&#160; She said that she googled 'free pregnancy tests' &amp; the Focus Pregnancy Help Center &amp; the Place of Hope, came up, she choose us.&#160; She was happy with the results &amp; I was too.&#160; She was a very pleasant woman that didn't believe in destroying 'life'.&#160;

I went to the center after the noon Mass downtown.&#160; John was hungry so I promised him a sandwich as soon as Rose arrived but he was to hungry to wait so he took the plastic container of my home fries with a bottle of ketchup, on the front lines, eating.&#160; I was a little miffed at him that he couldn't wait, like I asked him to, for it didn't look good eating out on the front lines like that, a sandwich is bad enough.&#160; I have to realize that he is giving his time freely &amp; he was hungry.&#160; He said that he only had some juice for breakfast, I only ask if he could add some eggs, bacon &amp; toast with that juice next time.&#160; He was now out there on the front lines &amp;

I saw that a young girl &amp; guy were standing at the entrance of Planned Parenthood &amp; he was smoking a cigarette.&#160; I called over to them, pleading with them, not to kill their precious baby.&#160; I said everything I could think of saying &amp; they went into the building any how.&#160; I left to go back to the center to see how Rose was doing &amp; to give her directions for the afternoon.&#160; Suzanne &amp; Pat, our new counselor for Monday afternoons, were going to be there at 3pm today due to some appointments.&#160; I couldn't wait for them to come.&#160; When I went back outside I saw that the abortionist had come in, to do her Thursday afternoon killings.&#160; My heart dropped, for I knew that the two young people that I pleaded with earlier, were her first victims, of the afternoon.&#160; I almost cried, I'll have to save it for later.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://ummmmheyyyy.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/short-hair-girl.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

There was a young girl with very short hair acting as a Death Escort today.&#160; Smiling &amp; greeting her victims leading them to the Door of Death, for their little ones.&#160; I know that I'm wasting my time on the Death Escorts &amp; the workers at Planned Parenthood so, through the grace of God I hope to stop talking to them.&#160; The bible says "not to cast your pearls to swine".&#160; That's what I'm doing.&#160; Besides I'm&#160; probably not acting 'Christ like' at times &amp; I don't want to hurt the Lord anymore than He's being hurt already.&#160; We never curse or swear but I do call begin names, at times at them, but on a whole I tell them to "repent", which I guess is Greek to them, though I have explained it to them on occasion.&#160; What I say is falling on deaf ears.&#160; I know that I'm <br />
angry that they are a part of killing little innocent, precious babies, which God had just created in the wombs of their mothers &amp; that people shouldn't kill kids, let alone it being their own mother.&#160; It will ONLY take God's grace to penetrate their stony hearts, not me.&#160; God be the Glory!<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://media.cnsnews.com/resources/67564.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="55" height="80" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:GSSPz-diVJUkHM:http://media.cnsnews.com/resources/67564.jpg" /></a>Just then Jerry &amp; Charles showed up to pray, the Rosary, across the street. I went back into the center to get more bottled water &amp; a chicken sandwich for John.&#160; There was Bernie, our landlord, finally fixing the front door so that it would close behind us.&#160; It's taken him 3 months to fix the front door.&#160; Oh well better late than never.&#160; He just trimmed the bushes about a week ago too.&#160; Great job Bernie!&#160; Maybe it's starting to look better where we are, in the corner, of the strip mall.&#160; When David Gantt finally leaves his office, at the end of the strip mall where we are, we'll take his office &amp; our pregnancy center will be more visible to the street &amp; sidewalk.&#160; Can't wait!!!&#160; :)<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://bedzine.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/painting-a-room-toutx.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="119" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:9bN9VsbVUTseCM:http://bedzine.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/painting-a-room-toutx.jpg" /></a>I went over to Jerry, after he was finished with the Rosary, to ask him if he could paint the Meeting Room, now.&#160; He gave me a hard time first but finally he did it.&#160; He didn't have a good paint brush to work with &amp; he had his good clothes on but other than that he went to work.&#160; Sorry about that. The room has an accented wall a dark green &amp; the rest of the room has a lighter green.&#160; Looks great Jerry &amp; thank you.&#160; Sorry for the short notice.<br /><br /><a id="thumbnail" href="http://newzar.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/taxi1.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="120" height="80" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:mTDKSiP-xNC1VM:http://newzar.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/taxi1.jpg" /></a>Suzanne &amp; Pat arrived &amp; Suzanne was training Pat to the work at the center. I just a call, on my cell phone, from the Mercy Outreach Center asking if we could take a client &amp; do a pregnancy teat.&#160; I said "yes, ask her to come on over, does she know where we are located"?&#160; The answer came "yes, she does".&#160; I told Suzanne to expect a client to come in for a pregnancy teat in the next 30 minutes or so.&#160; She did arrive &amp; Suzanne took her into the Rose Room. When the client was in the bathroom I saw that there was Suzanne, Pat &amp; Rose in the room &amp; said "there should be only one person in here". Suzanne smiled &amp; said that they all prayed together &amp; the client said that it was fine to have all three in the room at the same time for the test. Whatever the client says is fine with me.&#160; This is not usually the case but today it was &amp; Suzanne was able to show both Pat &amp; Rose how assist with the pregnancy tests, though we have our clients do the test, we only set up for the test, &amp; the client does the test &amp; reads the test results.&#160; We ask questions to fill out the Client Intake Sheet for our records &amp; to better assist our client with her needs now &amp; in the future.&#160; After the test I was asked if we had any Bus passes &amp; I said "no" but I'd give some money for a bus, for her, but we wanted her to be happy so we called her a cab, in the office right next to ours.&#160; They took her home.&#160; How convenient.<br /><br />
Suzanne &amp; Pat had to leave so Rose started supper &amp; we talked.&#160; First I wanted to go back outside, to see how John was doing, &amp; to have him come in now, for it was passed 4:30pm.&#160; We brought all the signs &amp; the literature box, into the center.&#160; He then worked on some projects, I had for him, in the office.&#160; </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0LLmWzKbOS4/TB3Q0E_uFYI/AAAAAAAAAVw/8zvph2KGe8A/s1600/tear-drop.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="100" height="80" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ChpQ3k_weABsNM:http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0LLmWzKbOS4/TB3Q0E_uFYI/AAAAAAAAAVw/8zvph2KGe8A/s1600/tear-drop.jpg" /></a>While I was out there, on the sidewalk, I noticed that the two young people were now leaving, after being in there for 3 hours.&#160; I spoke to them as they were leaving.&#160; Lord have Mercy on their souls.&#160; I went back into the center &amp; a few minutes later the doorbell rang &amp; it was Memo, who will be doing our spread sheets.&#160; Thanks so much for all your help, I really appreciate it.&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;I cleaned up the mess in the Meeting Room, for the painter had to leave.&#160; It looks beautiful in there now, so fresh &amp; clean &amp; bright.&#160; </font></strong></p></font></font></font><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font size="+0"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Tuesday 13, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></span><br style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif" /><br style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif" /><font size="4"><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://www.wellnesscatalyst.com/images/busy_woman.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 1px solid; border-left: 1px solid; margin: 10px 10px 0px; float: left; border-top: 1px solid; border-right: 1px solid" alt="See full size image" width="63" height="80" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nlMtE2e66PM9CM:http://www.wellnesscatalyst.com/images/busy_woman.jpg" /></a>When I arrived to the center Bill was there ready to put in the wood shelves in the cabinet that houses our signs &amp; literature packets.&#160; The shelves didn't fit so he'll be back tomorrow with the saw to fix the problem.&#160; As he was in the Material Aid Room working the male pro lifer came in &amp; then Mary S. to get some signs to take outside to start counseling.&#160; Martha was getting ready to go outside too.&#160; I went &amp; got coffee, next door at Macks, for both Martha &amp; Sandy, for they are the coffee drinkers.
