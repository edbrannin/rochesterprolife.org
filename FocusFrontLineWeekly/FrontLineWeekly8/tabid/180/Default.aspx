I rolled my eyes at Martha &amp; Carole &amp; said "we better watch out for these nasty girls on the way out".&#160; I wasn't wrong in my discernment.&#160; The one girl was on the phone taking loudly &amp; nasty on her cell phone in front of Planned Parenthood, while her three friends were in the hellish place, that will rob you of your soul.&#160; A young girl, that just came down the&#160;street&#160;was&#160;offered some baby clothes&#160;so her &amp; Martha went into the center to get some nice things in the Material Aid Room.&#160; So it was just Carole &amp; I out on the front lines &amp; it was hot!&#160; About 20 minutes later a girl was walking into Planned Parenthood &amp; I offered her some information &amp; just then the girl, on the phone, hollered "are those blank, blank people bothering you"? &#160;I called over to her to mind her own business for we were not talking to her.&#160; About 10 minutes later the car load of girls came around the bushes to be met with a crucifix &amp; a huge poster of an aborted baby.&#160; Carole was standing a little ways behind me holding the sign 'Planned Parenthood Kill Babies'.&#160; When the driver &amp; the passenger, in the front seat took a look at what was presented to them they had a conniption, the two girls in the back were silent.&#160; Carole then sad to them that Planned Parenthood is killing off your race.&#160; The girl in the passenger said "why don't you shut the blank up you old Hague".&#160; She kept on using foul language.&#160; The driver was wiggle worming in the front seat without a seat belt on &amp; that must have made the two girls in the back seat a little nervous, it would me.&#160; Then all of a sudden the girl in the passenger seat stuck half of her body out the window, she was big busted which probably saved her life because she could have fallen out of the car, head first as the driver was turning to make a left hand turn out of the parking lot.&#160; As they were driving away I called out to them on my mega phone "we love you, we love you".&#160; This might have made them madder but after they cool down it will be good to reflect that someone who you just treated like dirt loves you.&#160; Remember, we don't condone the behavior or the sin but we do love the sinner, just as Jesus does.&#160; Carole &amp; I were sad, for we knew that they were probably post abortive &amp; were sexually active&#160;&amp; couldn't get the help that they needed, due to their anger towards the very people that can help them.&#160; They harden their hearts.&#160; It's tough being out, on the front lines, for you see behavior that tears your heart up inside. </strong></font></p></div><div><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://srec.azores.gov.pt/dre/sd/115161010600/contacto/0708/espacodasletras/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz/flavia/computer%5B1%5D.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="74" height="79" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

About 30 minutes we get into the car &amp; go get it.&#160; While I was at the counter I saw a young mother with her small baby in a stroller.&#160; I offered her my card &amp; she took it.&#160; Then the cashier asked for a card too, I was glad to hand out my cards offering our services at the Focus Center.&#160; The pizza wasn't ready yet so I went back outside to talk to Martha.&#160; The guy came out to tell me that the pizza was ready so I walked back in.&#160; As I was at the counter, paying for the&#160;pizza, a guy &#160;was standing behind me saying to the cashier that his sister was pregnant again.&#160; So I turned around &amp; handed him one of my cards.&#160; He took it &amp; said "thank you, I'll give it to her".&#160; "That will be great" I&#160;said back.&#160; I believe that there is a ministry here at the pizza place!!!&#160; By the way the pizza was fattening &amp; delicious.&#160; They had put so much cheese on it, that the grease spilled out from the box &amp; onto my good pants &amp; favorite shirt.&#160; I'll use 'Stain be Gone' &amp;

It&#160;is like being on the front lines in the war zone of an actual war, where people get killed, because that's what happens at Planned Parenthood, little people&#160;are killed.&#160; You try to save their lives but the enemy (mother, father, grandparent, boyfriend, husband &amp; Planned Parenthood) decided that this little person must die instead of live.&#160; The crime: conception.&#160; These children are being killed because that were conceived, at an inconvenient time, for their mothers.&#160; The sex produced a baby.&#160; Oh no!&#160;&#160;I just wanted the sex &amp; orgasm &amp; not the child to raise for 18 years.&#160; So she comes to Planned Parenthood to make this little person 'go away' forever.&#160; She has her&#160;precious baby be murdered, by Planned Parenthood &amp; she gives&#160;them the&#160;money to do the act.&#160; Some pay by insurance, some by money order &amp; some by credit card, that's how they do it at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Not to many people really care, like I said "if abortion was for adults, there would be no abortions".&#160;&#160;Planned Parenthood&#160;just picks on someone, who is so&#160;tiny &amp; can't defend his or herself.&#160; Bullies they are!&#160; They will be judged someday for these murders, by Almighty God.&#160; I pray that they repent first.&#160; For Hell is forever......</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">I&#160;It was just Martha &amp;

"Yes you did my dear &amp; I'm glad that you did".&#160; She brought her child &amp; a friend &amp; received many nice things to take home with her.&#160;&#160;Another woman came in later on to receive some nice things too.&#160;

I think that he does.&#160; What kind of father would think that it was okay to kill little children.&#160; His wife has no reaction, she just picks the weeds from the flowers, in the front of their condo.&#160;

The gentleman stopped to talk to Martha &amp; I.&#160; He asked how anyone could do that, pointing to the graphic signs?&#160; I said that I didn't know how anyone could kill a precious baby.&#160; He&#160;asked how&#160;&#160; the workers, at Planned Parenthood, could&#160;get up in the morning &amp; get dressed &amp; come to kill kids.&#160; He just shook his head &amp; I did too.&#160; Then Cleveland, our street person, who we have befriended for 14 years now, came walking down the street, wanting food.&#160; Martha had some shoes for him, for&#160;his shoes that he was wearing, were all worn down.&#160; He&#160;came over to the crucifix, that&#160;we have out there on the front lines, &amp; he picked it up &amp; gave Jesus a kiss &amp; then said "he's my man".&#160; How beautiful &amp; the Lord smiled.&#160; Here this man is walking the streets &amp;&#160;has nothing &amp; he kisses the crucifix.&#160; His reward will be great.&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Now reality set in.&#160; The first of 5 cars, came driving out of Planned Parenthood, after having their babies be killed.&#160; It was a nightmare!!!&#160; The first was a girl had a fixed glare, she was just looking at me with&#160;a blank look on her face,&#160;with her middle finger up in the air.&#160; I asked if that was her IQ, for I thought that she was being belligerent.&#160; I spoke to her &amp; to the driver, who was probably her own mother.&#160; Martha mentioned that she will be praying for her.&#160; She seemed to be putting her finger down but raised it back up again when it finally hit me that they were doing abortions here today.&#160; I hollered to her "you had your baby killed here today".&#160; Her finger never came back down, as the mother drove off.&#160; What hell to pay in that household, in time.&#160; I hope that she will be able to forgive her mother &amp; the Death Escorts, who encouraged her to&#160;go into Planned Parenthood, to have her baby killed.&#160; This is now a generational sin &amp; will be passed on to the next generation, until someone breaks the cycle.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that will happen.&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">One car left&#160;the parking lot &amp; all I did was to show them the graphic pictures &amp; said "this is the hard truth".&#160; The male driver gassed his car so much that he burned rubber &amp; almost flipped over the car.&#160; The poor guy walking down the street looked in horror.&#160; The next car drove&#160;out about 15 minutes later with the guy &amp; girl in it,&#160;swore at us &amp; gave us the 'bird'&#160;&amp; drove hurriedly away.&#160; About 15 minutes later another car came out with a mother &amp; probably her daughter, who looked half dead, in the front seat, all crouched up.&#160; Thanks mom for nothing.&#160; Another generational sin.&#160; Then came the car with another guy driving out with his girlfriend, looking half dead, in the front seat.&#160; Relationship over!&#160; It will be just a matter of time.&#160; Then I spoke to two young people, in the parking lot, the male was smoking a cigarette.&#160; He said some colorful words to me&#160;&amp; I said to him "that&#160;is no way to speak to a lady".&#160; I then became suspicious &amp; said, to him "did you drive someone here to have her baby killed, if so you both are excessories to a murder, it's like driving the get away car, after a crime has been committed".&#160; The girl with him just flipped her arms up in the air, as if to say "oh well".&#160; They went into Planned Parenthood &amp; about 40 minutes later they both came out, with another woman, who was walking funny.&#160; Oh my Lord, she did have an abortion.&#160;&#160;They left the parking lot&#160;very arrogant, until it&#160;hits them someday of what they've done, here today.&#160; It won't be pretty.</font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">I was talking to&#160;the people who were&#160;coming out of the parking lot &amp;

She brought me the book 'Demonic Abortion' by Rev,Thomas Euteneuer.&#160; I will certainly read it Linda &amp; thank you.&#160; After Linda left,&#160;Martha &amp; I were spent,&#160;it was like being in a horror movie that wouldn't quit,&#160;we were both very angry at all the innocent blood that was shed here today &amp;

I was worried about Martha for she wasn't at&#160;Mass &amp; not at the center as yet.&#160; I later found out that Martha had left a voice message, on my home phone, saying that she was going to be late today due to her making brownies for the '40 Days for Life' meeting tonight.&#160; I didn't get the message, I don't know what happened.&#160; A few minutes later Rose came in &amp; I gave her some instruction to what to do this afternoon, in the center.&#160; She will be very busy, for most of the afternoon, with some down time in between.&#160; We are blessed in having her with us to work in the center.&#160; I finally got onto the sidewalk, on the bush side by the fence &amp; Jerry was across the street &amp; Rob was by the brick side of the building with the mega phone.&#160; I was there for about 10 minutes calling out to the girls &amp; all of a sudden I heard a voice &amp; I turned around to see Carole, coming up the sidewalk.&#160; I was so happy to see her.&#160; Her daughter just had a precious baby girl, last week &amp; she weighed 1lb. 7ozs..&#160; She just came back from visiting her family in another State.&#160; She said that the baby will need heart surgery &amp; just received the Sacrament of the Sick yesterday.&#160; This is a healing Sacrament &amp; it doesn't mean that you are dying, it&#160;just means that you are sick &amp; you&#160;need healing.&#160; Our hearts &amp; prayers go out to this sweet baby &amp; the parents &amp; the grand parents too.&#160; Carole looked at our precious sign of baby Malachi, who was aborted at 21 weeks, &amp; said that her grand daughter is around that age &amp; how could anyone do that to an innocent baby??&#160; My question too dear Carole.&#160; I don't know how&#160;a mother, could kill her very own child, no matter how much&#160;she didn't want him or her.&#160; 'Women are not programmed to kill&#160;their young'.&#160;

adoption.&#160; I wish that I could report what she was saying but&#160;it was very confusing.&#160; I gave her the 'Love Matter's' newspaper &amp; our brochure &amp; my card, for she wanted to send me some stats about adoption.&#160; She works, in the adoption office,&#160;at the Hillside Children Center.&#160; That does not impress me, for the abortionist Rachael Phelps, also had worked for Hillside Children's Center, at one time.&#160; How could they let an abortionist near these children at Hillside???&#160; They lost credibility with me.&#160; She seemed nice&#160;but confused, she was adopted &amp; I think that she needs some counseling.&#160; My heart goes out to her &amp; I am&#160;glad that she is alive!&#160; I do think that she realizes that her mother must have loved her, to have given her up, rather than had her aborted.&#160; All I know was that she had reacted to the graphic pictures &amp; had stopped to talk to us in this&#160;regard.&#160; She left us in a good way &amp; we said 'good bye" to her &amp; she walked across the street, to where Rob was counseling, to get into her car that was parked&#160;right near him.&#160; I heard her say to him&#160;"they (meaning Planned Parenthood) does other things than abortions".&#160; Oh no, I thought&#160;that she was on our side.&#160; Needless to say that she had said that to the right person, for Rob talked with her for over 30 minutes.&#160; Go Rob Go!!&#160; She left a bit miffed but certainly more educated then when she&#160;first arrived.&#160; She apparently is pro life,&#160;but is confused about some things, that&#160;he straightened her out about.&#160;

I get so defensive so I have to watch myself from getting nasty or being prideful.&#160; I looked him right in the eye &amp; said, "we are here to save lives".&#160; "Why's that".&#160; It time for me to let Carole take over, I only get upset.&#160; He went on &amp; on not making much sense &amp; then he said that he was an agnostic.&#160; He only believed in Science.&#160; Oh no!&#160; It is very hard to communicate with someone who has been programmed to not believe in God.&#160; I took a deep breath &amp; tried to talk to him along with Carole, it went back &amp; forth.&#160; I do remember looking up to Heaven &amp; asking for Divine assistance, which I received.&#160; I called Rob over &amp; told the young man, whose name was Joseph, to wait &amp; that another man could also talk with him.&#160; He said that he enjoyed talking to us women&#160; didn't like to talk to other males so much.&#160; Sorry bout that&#160;but we need another person to talk to you, which should be another male.&#160; Rob came over &amp; spoke with Joseph for over&#160;30 minutes.&#160; He planted many seeds into the mind of an&#160;agnostic today.&#160; Rob did a lot of teaching today, maybe that's because, he is a&#160;Teacher.&#160; There was another man waiting, to talk to Rob &amp; after he was finished with Joseph, he approached him.&#160; I saw that Joseph, was driving down the street, &amp; I called over to him saying,&#160;with the mega phone, "God bless you Joseph".&#160; I feel, in my heart, that the Holy Spirit used that prayer to touch his unbelieving heart.&#160;I feel good about the future of our Joseph.&#160; This man who was now talking to Rob was talking in broken English about his pregnant wife who if she didn't get the medicine that she needed from Rite Aid, that she would get an abortion &amp; he didn't want that, for this is his first child.&#160; Every time I asked him a question he said that he didn't understand &amp; that he apologized for his broken English.&#160; Well, Rob &amp; I didn't want&#160;to take any chances if this was a scam or not, we decided to&#160;give him the money that he wanted, to go get the medicine for his pregnant wife.&#160; His name was David, like the Bible, he said.&#160; Only God knows for sure if this was true.&#160; We do get scammed, out on the front lines, at times.&#160; Hopefully he'll come back, next time, holding his baby?&#160;

I just don't want to project my anger at her, for it isn't productive, in getting her out of there.&#160; You get more from honey than you do from vinegar (which I personally prefer).&#160; I asked her who was the new abortionist, for Rachael Phelps wasn't there, for her car wasn't parked&#160;in the spot by the&#160;Administration Entrance&#160;door, the past two weeks &amp; we know that babies are being killed in there.&#160; She said that she didn't know, for she&#160;is in the office in the front &amp; the abortions&#160;take place&#160;in the back. &#160;Never the two shall meet.&#160; As&#160;I was talking to her, one of the other workers was leaving, she had slowed down looking at her talking to me.&#160; I bet she will ask her some questions tomorrow about her talking with me.&#160; Maybe that will be her way out, she will be fired.&#160; A Christian can't work for Planned Parenthood, even if you work in the so called clean section, which is dirty too.&#160; No good places at Planned Parenthood.&#160;

Mother &amp; Daughter, is a complicated relationship, without all of this mess to deal with.&#160; They drive out of Planned Parenthood with blank looks on their faces, it's so hard to see this.&#160; We, as Christians, can only hope &amp; pray that they will choose God &amp; repent.&#160; Then they will be happy, not until.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><a id="thumbnail" href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/files/2009/01/iron-man-site-obadiah-stane.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="70" height="80" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

I rolled my eyes at Martha &amp; Carole &amp; said "we better watch out for these nasty girls on the way out".&#160; I wasn't wrong in my discernment.&#160; The one girl was on the phone taking loudly &amp; nasty on her cell phone in front of Planned Parenthood, while her three friends were in the hellish place, that will rob you of your soul.&#160; A young girl, that just came down the&#160;street&#160;was&#160;offered some baby clothes&#160;so her &amp; Martha went into the center to get some nice things in the Material Aid Room.&#160; So it was just Carole &amp; I out on the front lines &amp; it was hot!&#160; About 20 minutes later a girl was walking into Planned Parenthood &amp; I offered her some information &amp; just then the girl, on the phone, hollered "are those blank, blank people bothering you"? &#160;I called over to her to mind her own business for we were not talking to her.&#160; About 10 minutes later the car load of girls came around the bushes to be met with a crucifix &amp; a huge poster of an aborted baby.&#160; Carole was standing a little ways behind me holding the sign 'Planned Parenthood Kill Babies'.&#160; When the driver &amp; the passenger, in the front seat took a look at what was presented to them they had a conniption, the two girls in the back were silent.&#160; Carole then sad to them that Planned Parenthood is killing off your race.&#160; The girl in the passenger said "why don't you shut the blank up you old Hague".&#160; She kept on using foul language.&#160; The driver was wiggle worming in the front seat without a seat belt on &amp; that must have made the two girls in the back seat a little nervous, it would me.&#160; Then all of a sudden the girl in the passenger seat stuck half of her body out the window, she was big busted which probably saved her life because she could have fallen out of the car, head first as the driver was turning to make a left hand turn out of the parking lot.&#160; As they were driving away I called out to them on my mega phone "we love you, we love you".&#160; This might have made them madder but after they cool down it will be good to reflect that someone who you just treated like dirt loves you.&#160; Remember, we don't condone the behavior or the sin but we do love the sinner, just as Jesus does.&#160; Carole &amp; I were sad, for we knew that they were probably post abortive &amp; were sexually active&#160;&amp; couldn't get the help that they needed, due to their anger towards the very people that can help them.&#160; They harden their hearts.&#160; It's tough being out, on the front lines, for you see behavior that tears your heart up inside. </strong></font></p></div><div><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong><a id="thumbnail" href="http://srec.azores.gov.pt/dre/sd/115161010600/contacto/0708/espacodasletras/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz/flavia/computer%5B1%5D.jpg"><img alt="See full size image" width="74" height="79" style="border-bottom: 1px solid;

About 30 minutes we get into the car &amp; go get it.&#160; While I was at the counter I saw a young mother with her small baby in a stroller.&#160; I offered her my card &amp; she took it.&#160; Then the cashier asked for a card too, I was glad to hand out my cards offering our services at the Focus Center.&#160;

So I turned around &amp; handed him one of my cards.&#160; He took it &amp; said "thank you, I'll give it to her".&#160; "That will be great" I&#160;said back.&#160; I believe that there is a ministry here at the pizza place!!!&#160; By the way the pizza was fattening &amp; delicious.&#160; They had put so much cheese on it, that the grease spilled out from the box &amp; onto my good pants &amp; favorite shirt.&#160; I'll use 'Stain be Gone' &amp;

I finally went out, to the front lines, to be with the rest of the team.&#160; Rob was on the side of Planned Parenthood, by the bricks &amp; Martha, Mary S. &amp; myself were on the bush side.&#160; By the way those bushes are growing so tall.&#160; We still have some visibility,&#160;by the fence, to see the people walking in the parking lot, somewhat.&#160; Thank God that He can be everywhere at all times.&#160; We don't need to see a thing.&#160; We use the mega phone, which helps us to get the message through, to the people, going into the Killing Mill.&#160; They can't deny what we are saying to them.&#160;

she said that she was doing fine.&#160; She said that she has shared the information form the packet that we gave her months earlier.&#160; We were glad to hear that.&#160; I offered her another Truth packet &amp; told her that we had added more information in it so it, so some of it would be new.&#160; She took it &amp; said sweetly "thank you".&#160; She said that she was going to remain a virgin, for her husband, &amp; Martha &amp; I both agreed that was very good.&#160; She will have no regrets or emotional pain, in the sexual arena that so many girls are having today.&#160; Doing the right thing, may not be the easiest thing to do, but it's sure is the best thing to do.&#160; She said that she had to go but she promised Martha &amp; I that she will return for another visit, in the future.&#160; That will be nice :)&#160;&#160;What a joy it was for us to&#160;talk to&#160;someone, with the faith &amp; morals, desiring&#160;to do the right thing &amp; to lead a good life, that is pleasing to God.&#160; She will have a great marriage, with the right man, &amp; she will be happy &amp; have as many children, that God will give them, as a blessed&#160;family.&#160;

It&#160;is like being on the front lines in the war zone of an actual war, where people get killed, because that's what happens at Planned Parenthood, little people&#160;are killed.&#160; You try to save their lives but the enemy (mother, father, grandparent, boyfriend, husband &amp; Planned Parenthood) decided that this little person must die instead of live.&#160; The crime: conception.&#160; These children are being killed because that were conceived, at an inconvenient time, for their mothers.&#160; The sex produced a baby.&#160; Oh no!&#160;&#160;I just wanted the sex &amp; orgasm &amp; not the child to raise for 18 years.&#160; So she comes to Planned Parenthood to make this little person 'go away' forever.&#160; She has her&#160;precious baby be murdered, by Planned Parenthood &amp; she gives&#160;them the&#160;money to do the act.&#160; Some pay by insurance, some by money order &amp; some by credit card, that's how they do it at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Not to many people really care, like I said "if abortion was for adults, there would be no abortions".&#160;&#160;Planned Parenthood&#160;just picks on someone, who is so&#160;tiny &amp; can't defend his or herself.&#160; Bullies they are!&#160; They will be judged someday for these murders, by Almighty God.&#160; I pray that they repent first.&#160; For Hell is forever......</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">I&#160;It was just Martha &amp; I this afternoon, Tony stopped by &amp; was out on the sidewalk for about 30 minutes, while I was in the center talking with Suzanne, our Thursday afternoon counselor.&#160; Rose was in the Material Aid Room today helping out our clients.&#160; It was so good to see a young mother, who I spoke with on Tuesday, &amp; told her about our center &amp; invited her to come to get some things for her children.&#160; She said to me today "see I told you that I would come".&#160; "Yes you did my dear &amp; I'm glad that you did".&#160; She brought her child &amp; a friend &amp; received many nice things to take home with her.&#160;&#160;Another woman came in later on to receive some nice things too.&#160; Glad that our Material Aid Room is blessing you all.&#160; It does my heart good.&#160; Tony came in &amp; told me that he had to go, so I hurried to finish up some things, to go back outside to be with Martha, who was now alone on the sidewalk.&#160; Not good.&#160; I joined her within 5 minutes.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">I was now out on the front lines with Martha when we saw a young woman walk on the other side of the street.&#160; She was looking at the graphic signs &amp; seemed to be reacting to them.&#160; I called over to her to ask if we could help her.&#160; She replied "I'm pro choice".&#160; "No I answered back you are pro death, for in your choice there is a death".&#160; We went back in forth for a minute or two &amp; she finally said that we weren't &#160;going to agree on this".&#160; I called over to her as she was walking &amp; said "you are in bondage" &amp; that was that.&#160; I gave her to the Lord to set her straight.&#160;I do hope that I was lead, by the Holy Spirit, to plant a seed in her heart today.&#160; God be the Glory!&#160;I really do believe that the Holy Spirit brings people in our path, on the days that we are out there witnessing the Truth, about respecting life &amp; about abortion.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">I didn't think they were&#160;doing abortions today, I really thought that they were not, because the abortionist Rachael Phelps wasn't there, maybe she's still being interviewed by the New York Times.&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4"> What a sick article &amp; the responses too.&#160; I should have&#160;know better, they don't want to lose any $$$$, so they sent in a replacement to kill the babies today, all 5 of them.&#160; There were men dressed up in suits going in the Administration Building, I called out to them &amp; gave them a piece of my mind.&#160; One was smirking driving in smoking a cigar.&#160; I told him about cancer, maybe he didn't enjoy it as much, after that realization.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">I looked across the street &amp; saw Jim Bovay with his hands on his hips looking at me.&#160; Now, now Jim please get a life &amp; try to save one too.&#160; He gave the usual while with his finger, indicating that I was crazy.&#160; Whose calling the kettle black, James.&#160; He even walked over&#160;to the side of the sidewalk to be right in front of Planned Parenthood &amp; looked over to the Death Escorts &amp; did the while &amp; then pointed to me again.&#160; He's got it all wrong like usual.&#160; How about growing up, for goodness sake, you're at least 70&#160;years old by now.&#160;&#160;&#160;I asked him if he had any children, he seemed nervous at that.&#160; I think that he does.&#160; What kind of father would think that it was okay to kill little children.&#160; His wife has no reaction, she just picks the weeds from the flowers, in the front of their condo.&#160; Later on they walked over to the Gibbs St. restaurant &amp; they were talking to the owner, for awhile.&#160; I just stood, in our parking lot, across the street&#160;with my hands on my hips &amp; just stared at him, I guess I did it, for him to know, how it feels.&#160; Does he feel??&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">The young girl who works at the Tela Marking place across the street engaged in some talk with the Death Escort Barry Swan.&#160; I butted in &amp; started to talk to her then Martha added some words of wisdom too.&#160; She had her phone to her ears &amp; said, from across the street, at the vets, "I'm calling the police".&#160; No crime has been committed my dear only the crime of ignorance.&#160; I told her that when she wakes up &amp; needs help we will be there for her, Barry Swan &amp; Planned Parenthood won't.&#160; The police never came.&#160; </font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">Martha didn't have any money, so I hurried &amp; put some in the parking meter, for we saw the Meter Man's bright yellow vehicle coming down University Ave.&#160; The gentleman stopped to talk to Martha &amp; I.&#160; He asked how anyone could do that, pointing to the graphic signs?&#160; I said that I didn't know how anyone could kill a precious baby.&#160; He&#160;asked how&#160;&#160; the workers, at Planned Parenthood, could&#160;get up in the morning &amp; get dressed &amp; come to kill kids.&#160; He just shook his head &amp; I did too.&#160; Then Cleveland, our street person, who we have befriended for 14 years now, came walking down the street, wanting food.&#160; Martha had some shoes for him, for&#160;his shoes that he was wearing, were all worn down.&#160; He&#160;came over to the crucifix, that&#160;we have out there on the front lines, &amp; he picked it up &amp; gave Jesus a kiss &amp; then said "he's my man".&#160; How beautiful &amp; the Lord smiled.&#160; Here this man is walking the streets &amp;&#160;has nothing &amp; he kisses the crucifix.&#160; His reward will be great.&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Now reality set in.&#160; The first of 5 cars, came driving out of Planned Parenthood, after having their babies be killed.&#160; It was a nightmare!!!&#160; The first was a girl had a fixed glare, she was just looking at me with&#160;a blank look on her face,&#160;with her middle finger up in the air.&#160; I asked if that was her IQ, for I thought that she was being belligerent.&#160; I spoke to her &amp; to the driver, who was probably her own mother.&#160; Martha mentioned that she will be praying for her.&#160; She seemed to be putting her finger down but raised it back up again when it finally hit me that they were doing abortions here today.&#160; I hollered to her "you had your baby killed here today".&#160; Her finger never came back down, as the mother drove off.&#160; What hell to pay in that household, in time.&#160; I hope that she will be able to forgive her mother &amp; the Death Escorts, who encouraged her to&#160;go into Planned Parenthood, to have her baby killed.&#160; This is now a generational sin &amp; will be passed on to the next generation, until someone breaks the cycle.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that will happen.&#160; </font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">One car left&#160;the parking lot &amp; all I did was to show them the graphic pictures &amp; said "this is the hard truth".&#160; The male driver gassed his car so much that he burned rubber &amp; almost flipped over the car.&#160; The poor guy walking down the street looked in horror.&#160; The next car drove&#160;out about 15 minutes later with the guy &amp; girl in it,&#160;swore at us &amp; gave us the 'bird'&#160;&amp; drove hurriedly away.&#160; About 15 minutes later another car came out with a mother &amp; probably her daughter, who looked half dead, in the front seat, all crouched up.&#160; Thanks mom for nothing.&#160; Another generational sin.&#160; Then came the car with another guy driving out with his girlfriend, looking half dead, in the front seat.&#160; Relationship over!&#160; It will be just a matter of time.&#160; Then I spoke to two young people, in the parking lot, the male was smoking a cigarette.&#160; He said some colorful words to me&#160;&amp; I said to him "that&#160;is no way to speak to a lady".&#160; I then became suspicious &amp; said, to him "did you drive someone here to have her baby killed, if so you both are excessories to a murder, it's like driving the get away car, after a crime has been committed".&#160; The girl with him just flipped her arms up in the air, as if to say "oh well".&#160; They went into Planned Parenthood &amp; about 40 minutes later they both came out, with another woman, who was walking funny.&#160; Oh my Lord, she did have an abortion.&#160;&#160;They left the parking lot&#160;very arrogant, until it&#160;hits them someday of what they've done, here today.&#160; It won't be pretty.</font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">I was talking to&#160;the people who were&#160;coming out of the parking lot &amp; I heard a voice behind me &amp; I turned around to see Linda.&#160; She came to be with&#160;Martha &amp; I,&#160;for about 40 minutes, before going to Mass at 5:20pm,&#160;to talk to us &amp; to witness the Truth t the people driving by.&#160; She brought me the book 'Demonic Abortion' by Rev,Thomas Euteneuer.&#160; I will certainly read it Linda &amp; thank you.&#160; After Linda left,&#160;Martha &amp; I were spent,&#160;it was like being in a horror movie that wouldn't quit,&#160;we were both very angry at all the innocent blood that was shed here today &amp;

I was worried about Martha for she wasn't at&#160;Mass &amp; not at the center as yet.&#160; I later found out that Martha had left a voice message, on my home phone, saying that she was going to be late today due to her making brownies for the '40 Days for Life' meeting tonight.&#160; I didn't get the message, I don't know what happened.&#160; A few minutes later Rose came in &amp; I gave her some instruction to what to do this afternoon, in the center.&#160; She will be very busy, for most of the afternoon, with some down time in between.&#160; We are blessed in having her with us to work in the center.&#160; I finally got onto the sidewalk, on the bush side by the fence &amp; Jerry was across the street &amp; Rob was by the brick side of the building with the mega phone.&#160; I was there for about 10 minutes calling out to the girls &amp; all of a sudden I heard a voice &amp; I turned around to see Carole, coming up the sidewalk.&#160; I was so happy to see her.&#160; Her daughter just had a precious baby girl, last week &amp; she weighed 1lb. 7ozs..&#160; She just came back from visiting her family in another State.&#160; She said that the baby will need heart surgery &amp; just received the Sacrament of the Sick yesterday.&#160; This is a healing Sacrament &amp; it doesn't mean that you are dying, it&#160;just means that you are sick &amp; you&#160;need healing.&#160; Our hearts &amp; prayers go out to this sweet baby &amp; the parents &amp; the grand parents too.&#160; Carole looked at our precious sign of baby Malachi, who was aborted at 21 weeks, &amp; said that her grand daughter is around that age &amp; how could anyone do that to an innocent baby??&#160; My question too dear Carole.&#160; I don't know how&#160;a mother, could kill her very own child, no matter how much&#160;she didn't want him or her.&#160; 'Women are not programmed to kill&#160;their young'.&#160;

adoption.&#160; I wish that I could report what she was saying but&#160;it was very confusing.&#160; I gave her the 'Love Matter's' newspaper &amp; our brochure &amp; my card, for she wanted to send me some stats about adoption.&#160; She works, in the adoption office,&#160;at the Hillside Children Center.&#160; That does not impress me, for the abortionist Rachael Phelps, also had worked for Hillside Children's Center, at one time.&#160; How could they let an abortionist near these children at Hillside???&#160; They lost credibility with me.&#160; She seemed nice&#160;but confused, she was adopted &amp; I think that she needs some counseling.&#160; My heart goes out to her &amp; I am&#160;glad that she is alive!&#160; I do think that she realizes that her mother must have loved her, to have given her up, rather than had her aborted.&#160; All I know was that she had reacted to the graphic pictures &amp; had stopped to talk to us in this&#160;regard.&#160; She left us in a good way &amp; we said 'good bye" to her &amp; she walked across the street, to where Rob was counseling, to get into her car that was parked&#160;right near him.&#160; I heard her say to him&#160;"they (meaning Planned Parenthood) does other things than abortions".&#160; Oh no, I thought&#160;that she was on our side.&#160; Needless to say that she had said that to the right person, for Rob talked with her for over 30 minutes.&#160; Go Rob Go!!&#160; She left a bit miffed but certainly more educated then when she&#160;first arrived.&#160; She apparently is pro life,&#160;but is confused about some things, that&#160;he straightened her out about.&#160;

We can only dream, Carole.&#160;Martha was now across the street with Jerry &amp; Carmen.&#160; Just then a young man with a slurppy in his hand came over to Carole &amp; I &amp; the first thing he said to us was "why are you here"?&#160; I get so defensive so I have to watch myself from getting nasty or being prideful.&#160; I looked him right in the eye &amp; said, "we are here to save lives".&#160; "Why's that".&#160; It time for me to let Carole take over, I only get upset.&#160; He went on &amp; on not making much sense &amp; then he said that he was an agnostic.&#160; He only believed in Science.&#160; Oh no!&#160; It is very hard to communicate with someone who has been programmed to not believe in God.&#160; I took a deep breath &amp; tried to talk to him along with Carole, it went back &amp; forth.&#160; I do remember looking up to Heaven &amp; asking for Divine assistance, which I received.&#160; I called Rob over &amp; told the young man, whose name was Joseph, to wait &amp; that another man could also talk with him.&#160; He said that he enjoyed talking to us women&#160; didn't like to talk to other males so much.&#160; Sorry bout that&#160;but we need another person to talk to you, which should be another male.&#160; Rob came over &amp; spoke with Joseph for over&#160;30 minutes.&#160; He planted many seeds into the mind of an&#160;agnostic today.&#160; Rob did a lot of teaching today, maybe that's because, he is a&#160;Teacher.&#160; There was another man waiting, to talk to Rob &amp; after he was finished with Joseph, he approached him.&#160; I saw that Joseph, was driving down the street, &amp; I called over to him saying,&#160;with the mega phone, "God bless you Joseph".&#160; I feel, in my heart, that the Holy Spirit used that prayer to touch his unbelieving heart.&#160;I feel good about the future of our Joseph.&#160; This man who was now talking to Rob was talking in broken English about his pregnant wife who if she didn't get the medicine that she needed from Rite Aid, that she would get an abortion &amp; he didn't want that, for this is his first child.&#160; Every time I asked him a question he said that he didn't understand &amp; that he apologized for his broken English.&#160; Well, Rob &amp; I didn't want&#160;to take any chances if this was a scam or not, we decided to&#160;give him the money that he wanted, to go get the medicine for his pregnant wife.&#160; His name was David, like the Bible, he said.&#160; Only God knows for sure if this was true.&#160; We do get scammed, out on the front lines, at times.&#160; Hopefully he'll come back, next time, holding his baby?&#160;

&#160;Her friend came over to us who was just about to go in for the pregnancy test &amp; she said to her friend that she had an appointment at Planned Parenthood for the test.&#160; So her girlfriend said that she would go with her.&#160; So off they all go into the Killing Mill.&#160; I felt in my spirit that they will be back out &amp; it was not more than 5 minutes later, that they came walking right up to me, on the sidewalk.&#160;

They were at the center before&#160;Martha could cross the street.&#160; It was sad because the one girl was post abortive, so Martha gave her the help that she needed.&#160; So many of our clients are post abortive &amp; we must be ready to help them get the forgiveness, from God, in what they had done, &amp; the healing that they need.&#160; As the one girl was getting the pregnancy test. the other girl &amp; her child went into the Material Aid Room. to get what she needed for her beautiful child.&#160;

We have gone back &amp; forth, with each other over the years, but we are at a even plateau with each other, at this time.&#160; Don't get me wrong don't condone what she is doing there at Planned Parenthood. I just don't want to project my anger at her, for it isn't productive, in getting her out of there.&#160; You get more from honey than you do from vinegar (which I personally prefer).&#160; I asked her who was the new abortionist, for Rachael Phelps wasn't there, for her car wasn't parked&#160;in the spot by the&#160;Administration Entrance&#160;door, the past two weeks &amp; we know that babies are being killed in there.&#160; She said that she didn't know, for she&#160;is in the office in the front &amp; the abortions&#160;take place&#160;in the back. &#160;Never the two shall meet.&#160; As&#160;I was talking to her, one of the other workers was leaving, she had slowed down looking at her talking to me.&#160; I bet she will ask her some questions tomorrow about her talking with me.&#160;

is out on the sidewalk witnessing, every other Wednesday.&#160; It was raining &amp; thundering last Wednesday so she left early &amp; she said that she came back the next day, in the morning, &amp; Planned Parenthood was very busy.&#160; How sad.&#160; I went outside to get some things from the car &amp; I stopped a young couple who were walking down the sidewalk.&#160; I offered them a free pregnancy test &amp; free baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; They looked at each other &amp; she said that she would like to come in for a pregnancy test.&#160; "Come follow me", I said &amp; they did.&#160; I brought them into the Rose Room &amp; Maria took over &amp; she talked with the couple for a while &amp; then she assisted her with the pregnancy test.&#160; She spoke with&#160;them for awhile again &amp; then Kathy, who is post abortive, came into the room to speak with them for at least 20 minutes.&#160; I gave the couple a DVD &amp; the 12 week old rubberized baby &amp; some other brochures to take with them.&#160; I put out 5 baby onesees for them to pick out one to take with them, to bond with their precious baby.&#160; I was so happy that the Lord used me for His purpose, &amp; in my weakness.&#160; As I was leaving the center to go back to my car I saw our regular mom &amp; her son, they come often to be blessed in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I thought it best for Martha to assist them in their shopping.&#160; Just then Cleveland comes on in &amp; I asked him to leave, in a nice way, for I didn't have time to help him for I was busy assisting others in the center.&#160; After I was done I went outside &amp; told him that I would fix him some food &amp; I went to my car to get the last Roman Noodles to heat up for him.&#160; I wasn't done to long but when I came back outside he was walking up the street.&#160; I used the mega phone to call for him to come on back to get his lunch but he&#160;never came back.&#160; At least he had his new clothes on that I gave him yesterday to take home with him to put on.&#160;
