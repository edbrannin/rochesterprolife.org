latter &amp; painted part of my office wall, thank you Fred!!!&#160; We all were very busy today.&#160; So many people in need.......</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br

bank to deposit them all.&#160; Thank you everyone!!!&#160; I was busy in the office &amp; all the team were busy out in the Main Room!!&#160; So much to do!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size:

larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">It was a day of bad men.&#160; Sorry to say that because we have nothing but good men come into Focus to receive the help that they needed.&#160; But today was different, unfortunately.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">The first man is the boyfriend of our pregnant client Miss T. who came in for a pregnancy test &amp; was scheduled to go to Compass Care of an ultrasound the very same day but didn't.&#160; He is the father of this baby &amp; four other children, with her, but the man is not with it at all.&#160; I called many times to talk to Miss T but he wouldn't give her the phone &amp; then when I called days latter he hung up on me twice.&#160; I really don't know if she's still pregnant. He came in to get diapers &amp; I spoke sternly to him.&#160; One of our volunteers said that when he came in she smelled Marijuana on him, she is an Registered Nurse.&#160; I gave him the diapers &amp; he left &amp; he texted me an unkind text.......scary.&#160; I did not respond for he pretended to be Miss T..&#160; So sad!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Then the other man was unkind to Martha.&#160; I was in the office &amp; heard what he was saying to her &amp; I got up from my chair &amp; told him he had to leave, as he was going down the stairs, or I would call 911.&#160; &#160;Hopefully we will not see them again unless they get better.&#160; Please God please!!&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Otherwise it was a fruitful day helping people in need &amp; they were all grateful.&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Tuesday, January 8, 2019 at Focus&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">It was a good day, for I had Martha with me, &amp; Linda came latter on to help.&#160; We saw many nice clients that appreciated what we were doing for them.&#160; The smile on their faces is priceless.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">I worked in the office that looks so much better now for we have put many things away &amp; it looks less messy.&#160; Thank you to all who helped me especially Bobbie, she was wonderful.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">I went to Holy Hour, at St. Joseph's Church, in the evening instead of the late morning before Focus, it's much more quieter &amp; I did miss the people that were there.&#160; It's been awhile.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Wednesday, January 9, 2019 at Focus</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Early this morning I received a phone call from a young woman who said that her boyfriend &amp; his mother wants her to have an abortion but she doesn't want to.&#160; Praise God to hear that. She needed lots of support &amp; we talked for awhile.&#160; I called her this afternoon &amp; asked if Jessica could call her to talk to her &amp; she said "yes".&#160; Grate!!&#160; She was headed to the doctors for she was in pain.&#160; She is under so much stress.&#160; &#160;I told her to call me anytime day or night &amp; to keep in touch &amp; she said that she would.&#160; She sounds like a very nice girl.&#160; She is working &amp; has her own apartment.&#160; She had called the Police on him but they said that they could not help her.&#160; She is seeking out an Order of Protection but probably won't get one, for you have to have marks on you first, or be dead....sorry dear girl.&#160; The Lord is with her &amp; her precious baby.&#160; I emailed all to pray &amp; they will.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Martha, Joan.

Leone &amp; then four other Priests that were here&#160; There was Fr. Tony, Fr. Evan Simington, Fr. Mike Mayer &amp; Fr. Jim Hewes.&#160; Felt so happy to see them at Focus along with a lot of other Pastors in other Denominations.&#160; Pastor Walter Hoye spoke at Focus today &amp; will speak again tonight. It was splendid to be a part of this wonderful presences of good pro lifers.&#160; The speakers were informative &amp; I learned so much.&#160; Mike lost a cover to the Podium that he rented. Jim was so gracious in his talk &amp; presentation.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Martha's daughter Katie brough so many nice kids things for our clients children.&#160; My office was a mess but later on we put everything away.

Babies lives mean nothing to some.&#160; How sick &amp; how sad!!&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/politics/2019/01/22/albany-lawmakers-reproductive-health-act# .&#160;

I looked for it at 9 am &amp; it wasn't on.&#160; Media is so corrup &amp; liberal.......we deserve better!!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">There was a big group yesterday evening that came to pray the Rosary &amp; to listen to Pastor Walter Hoye speak the truth about abortion.&#160; The next door neighbor, right next to Planned Parenthood, called the police because he is pro choice &amp; doesn't like us.&#160; The police came &amp; drove down the street but didn't stop, to his dismay, &amp; he probably called the police again &amp; the same police officer stopped to let us know that we had to stand on the sidewalk &amp; not in the bike ride section of the street.....okay, we want to be safe!&#160; Thanks neighbor.&#160; Then the neighbor next to Jim Martin came out &amp; honked all the way down his driveway &amp; I stood there saying to him from the car window that we loved him &amp; he gave me his finger.&#160; It doesn't bother me for maybe someday he won't.&#160; Next was a man walking down the street hollering "pro choice" &amp; I said to him "pro death" &amp; repeated once more then I said "you should be ashamed of yourself &amp; he continued to holler as he walked up the street.&#160; Poor misguided man.&#160; Abortion is seriously killing off the African American Race just like they planned many years ago.&#160; Maafa:21 DVD, please get it &amp; watch it, you will learn a lot.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Saw some clients today with the help from Joan &amp; Annette.&#160; Lynda went home after dropping off the 25 cans of baby formula for she was not feeling well &amp; is planning to go to Florida tomorrow for a two week vacation.&#160; Hope she will feel better to go.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Thursday, January 24, 2019 at Focus</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">I arrived with food from Kentucky Fried Chicken &amp;

We saw clients &amp; helped them with their needs.&#160; We had our new volunteer Sandy here to help us &amp; Bobbie came in too.&#160; &#160;It's always better to have help so things get accomplished.&#160; I was in the office most of the time after going to the store for Focuses needs.&#160; I signed for the movie 'Unplanned' to see on March 28th. in Henrietta &amp; so did Martha.&#160; Also, so did Sandy &amp; Bobbie.&#160; It is a very difficult movie to see so I am glad that the Theater will be filled &amp; the proceeds will go to Focus Pregnancy Center......thank you Rick!!!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Martha did a pregnancy test on a young 16 year old female.&#160; Her boyfriend came in with her.&#160; An ultrasound was scheduled for tomorrow at Compass Care in the early afternoon.&#160; But before they came in there was a ruckus in the front &amp; I went out to derail it.&#160; The group left quickly &amp; quietly in theri red car.&#160; Thank God!!&#160; I told them if they don't leave I will call 911, with my hand on my phone.&#160; It worked.&#160; I was told that one of the girls was a family member, how sad.&#160; Please get along girls.&#160; I said to the man to protect both his girlfriend &amp; baby.&#160; He said that he would.&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Neyoka did a pregnancy on our client that constantly is pregnant.&#160; Baby number 5 is coming this year.&#160; She has some emotional problems &amp; is probably looking for love in all the wrong places.&#160; We'll take good care of her &amp; baby. like always.&#160; She has an ultrasound appointment tomorrow too.&#160;

Joan, Annette, Fred &amp; Frank were with Martha &amp; I &amp; we all worked hard.&#160; Fred went to Target, to purchase two pac'n plays, for our clients.&#160; I gave him the credit card &amp; the tax exempt paper to take with him.&#160; Before I came to Focus I went to Home Depot to purchase the keys, for the back door, if we ever need them, for the people who have the front door key.&#160; All is well.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">We are unable to see if our pregnant client went for her ultrasound at Compass Care today, they cannot give out that information.&#160; We are unfortunately unable to reach our pregnant client through phone, email, text, so upsetting.&#160; We only hope &amp; pray that she will continue her pregnancy.&#160; So maddening for us when this happens.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Thursday, March 14, 2019 at Focus</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Laura Jean was with Martha this morning from 11 am to 1 pm &amp;

a day!!&#160; It started last evening when I received a call from Neyoka telling me that water was on the basement floor &amp; that there is a NO PARKING TOW ZONE sign in the parking lot were we have parked for over 2 years now.&#160; I talked with Barb &amp; Mike &amp; they went to Focus to see what was happening in the basement.&#160; There is condensation from the toilet upstairs in the apartment that was left running while the guy went away for the weekend.&#160; Barb called the Plumber &amp; he will come this week to fix it.&#160; One problem solved.&#160; I was upset with the water &amp; the NO PARKING sign.&#160; I spoke with Barb &amp; she said I hope there will be no more problems &amp; I said "okay".&#160; Then I saw that I had a text on my cell phone &amp; it was Jackie asking for prayer of a woman that waa going for an abortion in the morning.&#160; Oh No!!!&#160; &#160;I wrote it out for my email list &amp; sent it out to them for prayers.&#160; At this time I don't know if she went or not......hopefully she did not go!!!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Now it it Tuesday &amp; I went to the bank &amp; got $100.00 worth of quarters for the meters &amp; spent a total of $25.00 to the city for parking.&#160; It would cost Focus so much money if we have to park on the street!!!&#160; Martha &amp; I went to the corner business &amp; spoke with six people that were having a meeting &amp; they said that they did not put up the sign &amp; knew nothing about it.&#160; Okay &amp; thank you!!!&#160; Who did???&#160; I went over to the sign &amp; called the towing company &amp; he was not there &amp; I was told that he would call me when he got in the office.&#160; He finally called back &amp; said that it was him who put it up &amp; he will take it down &amp; will not tow us........Praise the Lord!!!!&#160; Thank you Lord!!!!!!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">We were very busy &amp; we saw so many clients to assist them.&#160; Two new people, who were praying on the sidewalk, came in with two sisters for a pregnancy tests, who were at Planned Parenthood.&#160; One was pregnant &amp; is scheduled for an ultrasound.&#160; Not abortion minded!!&#160; The two young students from the Eastman School of Music walked them out.&#160; They were life saviors today&#160; :))))&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">A man who was outside praying came into Focus to introduce himself &amp;

to do pregnancy tests.&#160; I talked for about 15 minutes &amp; ended with my poem 'Jimmy' that I wrote in 1992.&#160; It was a blessed evening for me &amp; for Focus!!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">Tuesday, April 23, 2019 at Focus</span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: larger;">I was in the office all afternoon, so much to do.&#160;
