Thank you Jessica!! &#160;I will fight rather then give in for our sign is seen by all the cars going towards Scio St. &amp; the on in front of our building is seen by cars going downtown. &#160;The neighbors are pro choice &amp; liberal.......we're NOT!!! &#160; I received an email from Jim Martin, the neighbor who lives across the street from Planned Parenthood, &amp; I read it &amp; deleted it. &#160;Please don't email me again! &#160;Our attorney will deal with the City. &#160;Laws are made to be broken. This sign, in our window, helps to get the girls into Focus for a 'free' pregnancy test &amp; saves lives, from abortion, across the street. &#160;Killing little children happens in this neighborhood. &#160;Lord have Mercy!!!!! &#160;We have a right to save lives &amp; we have Freedom of Speech......which this sign represents.&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Martha &amp; I went to Mass at Our Lady of Victory Church, up the street. &#160;After Mass we came to Focus &amp; a few minutes later Kathryn came to assist us. &#160;She is so wonderful &amp; she gave us an Applebee's dinner card for a free meal. &#160;How nice was that. &#160;Later on Barb came to help us. &#160;We were very busy. &#160;A father of triplet boys&#160;came in &amp; got a lot of nice things for his family. &#160;A couple &amp; their son came in to drop off baby lullabies&#160;DVD's &amp; baby blankets in a bag &amp; new baby books. &#160;What a nice donation. &#160;She found us in the Wish Book &amp; blessed us so much. &#160;As they were leaving Martha said something about today's feast day &amp; I said that they probably weren't Catholics, to which he replied that they were, at one time. &#160;I said that once you are Baptized Catholic you are forever Catholic. &#160;The man said that someone else told him that&#160;but we're okay, he said. &#160;I quickly gave him the 10 Commandments &amp; Heaven, Hell &amp; Purgatory brochure &amp; said "please go to Confession &amp; Mass &amp; Holy Communion every Sunday" as they walked down our three steps to their car.

Matter of fact, she was in Focus to get some things for her son on Wednesday, the day of the call by Lynda. &#160;This client&#160;was brought to Compass Care, by Neyoka, for an ultrasound &amp; she saw her sweet baby &amp; heard her precious baby's heart beat. One wonders how this could have happened. &#160;I will send her Post Abortion brochures &amp; Project Rachel information, for God's forgiveness &amp; healing. &#160;</span></strong>&#160;<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Sent!</span></strong></div><p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;A&#160;hard day!!!!</strong></span></span></p><hr /><p>&#160;<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>PLEASE GO TO NEXT PAGE 32</strong></span></span></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;HAPPY NEW YEAR IN 2017!!!</strong></span></span></span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong> <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;  &#160;</span></span></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>P</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=258&amp;tabid=259"><span style="font-size: medium;">revious</span></a></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> | N</span><a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=260&amp;tabid=259"><span style="font-size: medium;">ext</span></a></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> P</strong><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><strong>age</strong></span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"></span></strong></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">&#160;</div><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></p><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br type="_moz" /></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></strong></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> </strong></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div></div><!-- End_Module_596 --></div></td></tr><tr><td><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td width="100%" nowrap></td><td nowrap></td><td nowrap><a id="dnn_ctr596_dnnACTIONBUTTON3_ico1" href="javascript:__doPostBack('dnn$ctr596$dnnACTIONBUTTON3$ico1','')"><img title="Print" src="/images/action_print.gif" alt="Print" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td nowrap></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td width="100%" height="5"></td></tr></table></td>
