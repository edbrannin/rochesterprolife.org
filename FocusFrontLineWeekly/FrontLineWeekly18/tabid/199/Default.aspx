he said that it was a back up from the water heater because it  wasn't being used as much.&#160; He said that if we use the hot water it will deplug  &amp; not back up any longer.&#160; Okay Bernie.&#160; It didn't leak anymore&#160;because Paul  used the hot water in cleaning all the toys that Ni,our client advocate&#160;on  Mondays, had brought into Focus from a neighbor friend of hers.&#160; We are most  grateful for both of your kindness &amp; generosity,&#160;to our clients.&#160;I received  an email yesterday, from Janene, stating that&#160;she &amp; her two home school  children &amp; her friend will be coming to Focus today to volunteer.&#160; That is  always wonderful.&#160; We have volunteers, from St. John of Rochester Church,  that&#160;come twice a month to help us out.&#160; When they arrived we greeted them &amp;  then gave them a work assignment which was to straighten out the baskets of  clothes in the Material Aid Room so that the right size clothes&#160;were in the  right basket.&#160; They worked for 2 hours in that room &amp; at the end it looked  great!&#160; We also received a box of bread &amp; some canned goods from our friend  Jerry.&#160; Also, we received many bags of non perishable food items&#160;from the good  people of St.Pius the Tenth Church, in Chili.&#160; It was great to see our two  friends again as they brought in the food, for we&#160;haven't see them since  October,&#160;of 2012.&#160; They look &amp; feel fine.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The three Elim Bible Institute students weren't  here today, for school hasn't begun yet.&#160;

She also said that  Tom was not going to be there either.&#160; I told Martha &amp; she said that she had  a car appointment, for her car to be fixed,&#160;at 1pm so she would be there on the  front lines,&#160;at 10:30am until 12:30pm today with Mike &amp; Paul.&#160; I told her  that I would come after Mass at 1pm.&#160; So it was all agreed.&#160; I did arrive at 1pm  &amp; Paul was there &amp; Mike.&#160; After being in the center talking with Paul  for a few minutes went outside to be with Mike.&#160; Thank God that Karen came to be  in the center along with Paul.&#160; I did go back into the center to speak with  Karen &amp; while I was there a young girl with her baby in the stroller asked  us if we were going to be having any meetings.&#160; I asked her of what?&#160; She  replied "oh something like encouragement classes".&#160; I said "maybe also Parenting  Classes &amp; topics like that".&#160; She said "yes".&#160; I asked her to go back into  the Material Aid Room to write it down on the Intake Sheet there so that when we  start we will notify her of the class.&#160; She said "okay" with a smile on her  face.&#160; Karen &amp; I just looked at each other, for we had talked about having  classes last year, so maybe this is the year for classes.&#160; I then went back  outside&#160;&amp; Jennifer was there.&#160;I greeted her &amp; she took two signs &amp;  stood in the bike ride,&#160;area of the street, to witness.&#160;</span></p></div></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I had received an email from Debbie asking if she  &amp;

I know that Karen leaves at 3pm so I was hoping that Suzanne would  be there to let then know what to do at Focus.&#160; It worked out that she was there  when all three ladies showed up today.&#160; I did get to meet them all &amp; it was  a blessing for me.&#160; They will return back to Focus when they can.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I was so happy that Jennifer, Mike, Adolf &amp; Dan were with me today.&#160; I  knew that Martha was coming back after her car appointment but I didn't know  when that would be.&#160; So I started to witness to the people driving into the  Killing Mill, Planned Parenthood.&#160; It's such an horrible sight to see the girls  coming out in the car with their faces down or their bodies placed down in the  car.&#160; They usually give me the finger or say not so nice things to me but I  figure that they just had their precious baby be murdered, so they're not going  to be to happy with us.&#160; We are the ones that tried to help them not to make the  worst mistake of their lives, to which they will suffer, &amp; so will, the  drivers of the car, for they are supporters of this murder against this child.&#160;  No one wins after having an abortion, for we hurt too.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">An African American man was walking down the sidewalk &amp; he said to  us&#160;"keep up what you're doing out here".&#160; I said "we will".&#160; Then Jennifer asked  him to join us.&#160; He said nervously "no I can't".&#160; I said "they're killing off  your Race".&#160; He said "they're killing all Races".&#160; I returned saying "yes they  are killing all Races but they're killing off your Race".&#160; He continued to walk  up the sidewalk away from us.&#160; I hollered to&#160;him saying&#160;"you have&#160;a good heart  &amp; have a&#160;nice day".&#160; But we were disappointed in his response of the loss of  his Race of people.&#160; Lord have Mercy !!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Mike had to leave &amp;

I hope that they  repent too.&#160; Two young women were bringing in three children, which sends a  shiver down my back.&#160; Poor kids.&#160; Some guy hollered out his car window something  I won't repeat.&#160; I hollered back to&#160;him saying "love ya".&#160; I should have also  said 'repent'.&#160; I don't know if he even heard me for he was up the street when I  said what I said.&#160; It&#160;doesn't really matter, for he had disdain in his heart,  for what we were doing out on the front lines.&#160; Poor guy :(&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If&#160;&#160;he only knew that we could help him.&#160; He was probably a post abortive  Dad.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha came at around 4:30pm &amp; she stayed in the center to help out our  new volunteers.&#160; I stayed outside with John, who came around 4pm, just after  Jennifer &amp; Adolf had left, to 5pm &amp; then we both left to go into the  center.&#160; I said "hi" to Suzanne &amp; spent some time with Debbie &amp; her two  daughters.&#160; They helped us out a lot today.&#160; Paul was still&#160;there &amp; he does  so much at Focus.&#160; He is our 'cleaning man'.&#160;&#160;I noticed that the front door was  not locking behind me, when I came into the center, so Martha called Bernie  &amp; our new landlord Dan.&#160; Dan called back &amp; I got to speak with him about  the door.&#160; He said that he would call the taxi company, so that they remember,  when they come in to make sure that the door is locked behind them.&#160; I also  wrote them a note.&#160; He said that it would be fixed tomorrow, which it was.&#160;  Thanks Dan.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone had left so Martha&#160;&amp;

Natalie started to talk with him.&#160; She gave him some important  information, to assist him.&#160; See how Focus works.&#160; Thank you Lord!&#160; I was sad to  hear that they have become so busy that they will only be at Focus once a month  instead of twice a month<font size="2"><font face="Arial">.&#160;</font></font> They are such a blessing to Martha &amp;

She  sounded happy on the phone.&#160; Martha worked on the layette for her when she got  into the center.&#160; I ate a quick lunch &amp; went into the office to do some  things.&#160; Later the doorbell rang &amp; it was a client who needed some thing for  her friend's child that she is caring for while mom is in jail.&#160; Martha was  going to leave early today to get ready for her test on Thursday.&#160; Lynda came in  to help us this afternoon.&#160; We all talked for a short time &amp; then Martha  left.&#160; We then received bags of non perishable foods from St. Pius the Tenth  Church.&#160; Kay, who brings the food in with her husband, asked me to write a note  for the Church Bulletin to let the people know what happens to their food  donations.&#160; "Maybe you'll get more food if you can write a short note", Kay  said.&#160; I said that this was a great idea &amp; I will write one.&#160; We  decided&#160;that next week, when she &amp; her husband bring in more donations&#160;for  our&#160;clients, I will give it to her.&#160; This is a great idea for our clients who  are in need.&#160; More food the better.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the doorbell rang again &amp;

She was the girl that I had asked to  leave, last year,&#160;for she was taking to much &amp; I had said a couple of times  to her "only one bag not three".&#160; We reconciled at another time when she came  back to Focus.&#160; I just have to watch her closely.&#160; She's fast &amp; furious.&#160; I  guess that's her personally.&#160; Lynda &amp; I went into the storage room &amp; got  a nice bag of baby girl items for the new baby who will be born&#160;soon.&#160;&#160;They went  into the Great Room to get some food too.&#160;

 The doorbell rang again &amp; two young ladies came in with some big toys &amp;  some other donations.&#160; That was so nice of them.&#160; Lynda came them with some new  things that she had brought into the center, for our clients.&#160;&#160;It was a black  leather purse &amp; a watch.&#160; They were delighted with this surprise.&#160;&#160;It was  now 4:30pm &amp; Lynda had left to go to Mass at Holy Cross Church.&#160; I was now  alone.&#160; Jerry, the bread man, &amp; Paul didn't come today.&#160; The Elim Bible Students didn't come  today either so I hope that they are coming next Wednesday to help us out.&#160; I worked  until 7:30pm &amp; then left to go to Wendy's for my supper tonight.&#160;

I spoke to everyone who came into  the Killing&#160;Mill &amp; left the horror house.&#160; &#160;Some had just had an abortion,  the killing of their very own child.&#160; I try to witness to them in what they just  had done &amp; for them to REPENT for the sin of killing their child.&#160; I usually  get the finger or a nasty comment or they just look down in the passenger side  of the car.&#160; I try to address the driver too, of their sin against God, of being  an accessory to this killing.&#160;</span></div></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">God &amp;

I saw &amp; spoke  with Suzanne, as I was leaving the center, &amp; going back to the front lines.&#160;  Sandy was walking up the street heading to Focus to help us out this afternoon.

It also thins the lining of the uterus so that an egg, if fertilized, will not  implant.&#160; I told her to get it taken out , for it causes an abortion,  &amp; then gave her our Pro Life Doctor List.&#160; I showed them, for their was a  child in the back seat, where the Focus Pregnancy Help Center was for 'free'  clothes &amp; items.&#160; They both said "thank you" &amp; drove away.&#160;</span></div></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">A car came in with a couple &amp; the man looked at  the graphic picture for a long time.&#160; They left about 5 minutes later.&#160; I want  to believe that they 'chose life' today.&#160; Praise God!&#160; John came around 4pm  &amp; prayed the Rosary.&#160; He later on helped me to bring the things back into  the center.&#160; Sandy was still there &amp; we received a client who needed diapers  &amp; some clothes.&#160; We assisted her then the doorbell ran again &amp; it was a  young man who comes in for diapers for his son.&#160; He also got some men's clothes  for himself.&#160; I thank him for being a good Father.&#160; Sandy was laving when the  doorbell rang again &amp; it was three women.&#160; The mother of the daughter who is  pregnant came in with her sister &amp; her young son, for diapers &amp;  clothes.&#160; I took the daughter into the counseling room &amp; talked with her for  a few minutes.&#160; I prayed with her &amp; gave her a Truth packet &amp; a Growth  &amp; Development DVD.&#160; Her mother is supportive of her situation.&#160; Thank  God!&#160;&#160;&#160; When everyone had gone I called Martha &amp; found out the her test was  negative &amp; all is well with her.&#160; Thank God!!&#160; I did more things at the  center &amp; then went home without having supper.&#160; I thought that I would eat  at home tonight again.&#160; When I pulled into my garage I saw two cars pulling in  behind me.&#160; One of the cars was Ana, from the Second Had Store, bringing in her  donations for the pregnancy center.&#160; The man in the other car helped her put the  things into my car.&#160; Yeah!&#160; I got to talk to Ana for a few minutes which was  great &amp; then she left.&#160; I went into my apartment &amp; fixed a fish supper  with a glass of red wine &amp; ate.&#160; </span></div></span></span></div></div></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: medium;"></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></div></span></font></div></span></span></strong></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><font face="Arial"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> <hr /></span></div></font></div></span></strong></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span> </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></div></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span> </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div></div></span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><span id="SPAN2" style="font-size: 16px;"><span id="TextLabel" style="font-size: 16px;">Catholic social teaching reminds us that it is not enough to  passively await God's kingdom in the next life.

then into the  Great Room to get some food.&#160; The little girl said that she was hungry so Martha  gave her a homemade plan cookie.&#160; The little girl also went into the Counseling  Room &amp; got two lollipops, from the table, until I locked the door.&#160; Busy  little girl, so cute.&#160;Then the doorbell rang &amp; rang again.&#160; It was a very  busy day at Focus.&#160; Our new volunteer came in around 1:15pm &amp; I greeted her  &amp; put her to wok pronto.&#160; She adapted very well.&#160; Martha &amp; I thanked God  for her because&#160;we don't know if we could have done it without her.&#160; She'll be  back next Wednesday around 2:30pm or so.&#160;&#160;Thank God!&#160;

One of the girls is pregnant with a baby girl  so we want to take care of her &amp; her friends.&#160; Then a another pregnant mom  came in with her two young children &amp; she saw the musical rocker.&#160; I tried  to call to see if there was a recall on it but we couldn't find the number to  call.&#160; So we gave it to her &amp; she signed the Liability Wavier, to protect  our center.&#160; She is a mature mother so I know that she will be fine with it.&#160;  She also said that it was a new version of the rocker so she didn't think that  there were any recalls on it.&#160; I did ask her to call the company if she finds  the phone number &amp; she nodded her head 'yes'.&#160;&#160;My heartache came when she  signed in &amp; it was reported that&#160;she had three past abortions.&#160; How sad.&#160;  She had to leave so I didn't address that today but I will, in the future sent  her some Post Abortive brochures for help &amp;

I got to the center I saw tat  Jennifer, the Tuesday sidewalk counselor in front of Planned Parenthood was  talking to a mom with a child in the stroller.&#160; When I got out of the car I  walked up to them to open up the door to find out that the young girl was the  girl that her precious baby was saved from being aborted 2 years ago.&#160; She has a  remarkable testimony &amp; I asked her if she would give it to the people after  the Mass on April 10th. at 6pm.&#160; She said "yes" with a huge smile on her face.&#160;  I was smiling too.&#160; I said that I will call her closer to the date to remind her  &amp; she said "thank you that would be great".&#160; I opened up the door &amp; she  went into the center to get some things for her fine little boy.&#160; I briefly  spoke with Jennifer before she headed to Planned parenthood to pray with  Christine.&#160; Then Martha came into the center &amp; we opened up all the doors to  the center.&#160; I then went to the car &amp; got out all the bags of donations,  from Ana, at the Second Thought Store, in East Rochester.&#160; I then got the mail  &amp; went to the box at the corner to put them in it.&#160;&#160;I felt relieved that  that was done.&#160; I went back to the center where there was a lady coming out  &amp; I stopped to talk with her.&#160; She said that she wanted to stop by to see if  we could help her with her daughter that might be having sex.&#160; She said  something like "I should give her condoms".&#160; I was surprise &amp; upset with  that comment.&#160; I then gave her our Truth packet &amp; some other brochure &amp;  a DVD.&#160; I told her to also read the materials that I just gave her.&#160; I asked if  she could bring in her daughter so I could speak with her.&#160; She said "yes, I'll  try".&#160; We'll see if she does.&#160; I sure hope so.&#160; Then she left.&#160; The doorbell  rang &amp; I still had my coat on so I answered it &amp; guided the two women to  the Material Aid Room.&#160; The older woman said that she had called me &amp; I said  that we could make up a layette for her daughter for she just had a baby girl  two weeks ago.&#160; Martha had made up a boy &amp; girl layette so I went to get the  one for a baby girl.&#160; I then brought the young lady into the Rose Room &amp;  asked her to fill out the Intake Sheet so that we could call her on occasion to  see how she was doing.&#160; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; a DVD &amp; some other  brochures &amp; information.&#160; As they were leaving I asked the mother, of the  daughter, what&#160;are the name of her twins that she had referred to.&#160; She said  London &amp; England.&#160; I said "I remember you".&#160; She said "yeas I was here about  4 years ago &amp; you helped me with my twins.&#160; I said "great &amp; know you're  helping out your daughter".&#160; She said "yes I am".&#160; I asked them to come again if  they needed anything else.&#160; Then they left.</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Martha had brought in an Italian pasta salad for  lunch &amp;

Oh darn.&#160; I had  things for her to do in the office but it worked out &amp; I got some of the  things done myself.&#160; Paul didn't come today either for he was helping out one of  our clients with her needs.&#160;

 needed many things.&#160; I went back in the store room to get some new things for  her to take with her today.&#160; They both were grateful.&#160; After they left I called  JO up &amp; he said that the one girl was the girl that had nothing that had  lived on Grape St. before she was evicted &amp; is now living with her sister  temporally.&#160; I said that I didn't know that was her &amp; I had a package filled  with information in it.&#160; I asked for his address so I could sent it to him to  give to her but then I said that I would call her friend that had brought her to  Focus to come back to get the information.&#160;

it was two of the three aggressive  girls.&#160; The pregnant girl first says "I'm hungry, do you have anymore of those  brownies left, from last week".&#160; I said "no we don't" &amp; went to get the car  seat for her as the other girl went into the Material Aid Room to help herself.&#160;  I told them that this was it for February so we'll see you again in March.&#160; They  need tough love.&#160; I also said that your child couldn't be growing that fast, for  you were in here last week.&#160; I then walked back to the table &amp; finished my  supper.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that these two girls will do all right in this big  world.&#160; The pregnant young lady has a lot head of her &amp; we are here to help  her.&#160; After supper I called one of our clients to tell her that we had a boy's  layette for her &amp; she said that she will try to stop by tomorrow to get it.&#160;  Then I called two of our clients to see if they were going for the ultrasound  tomorrow.&#160;

started to work.&#160;I brought in some bacon &amp; tomatoes for a  bacon &amp; tomato sandwich for lunch.&#160; Martha was getting our lunch ready when  the doorbell rang &amp; it was a client &amp; her young child to get something's  in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I was on the phone with Lynda telling me that she  couldn't come in today because her old dishwasher broke down &amp; water was all  over the kitchen floor &amp; some of the water seeped down into the family room  below, causing a mess.&#160; She told me some other things &amp; I was on the phone,  with her,&#160;for about 15 minutes.&#160;After I hung up&#160;I went into the Green Room to  eat lunch with Martha.&#160; I was disappointed that Lynda couldn't make it today,  for I had a lot to do, especially in the office, that I wanted her to help me  with.&#160; That happens &amp; I have to deal with it.&#160; Then Katherine, another  volunteer,&#160;didn't show up so I called Rob &amp; he told me that she said that  she couldn't make it every Wednesday only when she could.&#160; Okay, disappointment  # 2.&#160; Thank God that Sandy showed up to help us today.&#160; I made arrangements with  Paul yesterday for him to stop by today, after Valerie's doctor's appointments  for her two children, so he could go over to Mary Lou's apartment with Martha,  to get the microwave &amp; roaster for Pat.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that that will go  well.&#160; Pat called me back &amp; said that she was at the Board of Education office arguing with the  Board&#160;for them refusing to come to her house, because of where she lives, to  give care to her great grandchildren.&#160; She was so upset.&#160; I said "don't get  arrested for I don't have the money to bail you out".&#160; I asked her to calm down  &amp; to&#160;talk reasonably with the people &amp; to pray to God to help you.&#160; She  said "okay".&#160; I then told her that all her appliances will be at Focus tonight  &amp; for her to stop by around 6pm to pick them up.&#160; She said that she would  try &amp; thanked me &amp;

It was now 5pm &amp; Paul showed  up.&#160; Martha &amp; I were so happy to see him.&#160; They asked Dan to go with them to  pick up the large &amp; heavy appliances &amp; he said that he would.&#160; The girls  continued their work.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; I let in a woman in who wanted  diapers.&#160; I asked her if she was here last week &amp; she said "yes".&#160; I then  told her that she could come in once a month.&#160; She said "I only need diapers".&#160;  I said then twice a month for we can't supply you with your diapers, you must  find a way to buy some.&#160; She looked disappointed but if I did that for her I'd  have to do it for everyone &amp; we couldn't afford it.&#160; I felt badly about that  but we also want to teach them to how to survive plus helping them when they are  in need.&#160; They are the chief providers of their family, we're not, we're only a  temporary helper.&#160;

then some more icky talk.&#160; She even threatened me  saying that she was going to hurt me.&#160; Then she got into the car &amp; they  pulled out.&#160; While the car was waiting for the on coming cars to pass, I asked  her if she did that &amp; I pointed to my graphic sign.&#160; Then she got out of the  car &amp; she walked up to me threatening me.&#160; I said "first I want to call the  police" &amp; reached for my cell phone.&#160; "I don't care if you call the police  you white blank, blank".&#160; Then she said that she was going to get the man too.&#160;  Poor girl!&#160; Her mother called her back into the car &amp; she started to go back  to the car when I asked her "are you racist"?&#160; She looked surprised at my  comment &amp; then went into the car &amp; they drove away.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; Then John  said to me that I shouldn't talk to people that are so aggressive.&#160; I said "John,  please don't scold me, for I did what I thought I should do, &amp; we're okay, by  the grace of God".&#160; Why didn't he say "I thank God that we're okay", <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">or</span></span> something  soothing like that<font size="2"><font face="Arial">?</font></font>&#160; I felt defensive to him.&#160; I was more upset with him then I was with her, I think.&#160; Maybe  because I knew that God would protect us &amp; I wasn't afraid, even though she  was threatening &amp; aggressive &amp; very loud, &amp; because I've had people  approach me like that for a very long time, in my street ministry.&#160; I felt like I was being prideful so I asked God to forgive me, for what I said to John.&#160; I <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">said that I was sorry to him too</span></span><font size="2"><font face="Arial">.<font size="2">&#160; </font></font></font>We both then  went into Focus &amp; Martha, John &amp; I sat at the table &amp;we talked, for  about 15 minutes, about other things before he had to go to catch the bus.&#160; He is  a dear man &amp; I respect him so much.&#160; Martha &amp;

We got in to Focus &amp; I noticed that the picture that I had in  the hall had fallen unto the floor &amp; the glass was busted but no one had  cleaned it up they just put the plant closer to the picture, I guess to protect  us from being cut.&#160; I don't know what happened.&#160; I called up Ni, the client  advocate who comes in on Mondays, &amp; she didn't know anything about it.&#160; I  asked one of the taxi guys &amp; he didn't know what happened either.&#160;

I said to Martha her&#160;to get  her a few&#160;'new' outfits for her baby girl still in utero &amp;&#160;Mom was happy.&#160;  Then we went back to the table &amp; finished our cheese sandwiches, for  lunch.&#160;&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp;

him about Adoption &amp; she&#160;said that it was a  possibility.&#160; We were blessed by a friend of Ni's that gave us a stroller, car  seat, a baby&#160;swing &amp; baby jumper &amp; at the end of the day three of them  were taken.&#160; Martha called to see if all was well with these items &amp; all was  well with them except the&#160;car seat which was on Recall &amp; was over 6 years  old &amp; had to be thrown out.&#160; How discouraging is that but we get  through&#160;it.&#160;

I returned after Mass today at  1:15pm.&#160; I put a note on the front door saying that Focus will be open at 1:20pm  today.&#160; Mass is a little longer on Feast Days.&#160; When I pulled into the driveway  there was a woman with her young son who was around 4 years old standing by the  front door.&#160; When I got out of the car I said to her "how long have you been  waiting" &amp; she said "for a little while".&#160; She had bags of groceries with  her too.&#160; I opened up the front door to let them in &amp; then I went to open up  the rooms.&#160; Martha was now in the center when the lady asked her for a pregnancy  test.&#160; I started to make lunch, tuna fish sandwiches &amp; corn chips,&#160;&amp; I  did some other things too while Martha did the pregnancy test.&#160; After the client  left Martha told me that she was negative but had had an abortion in the past.&#160;  She has four children now but thinks about what she did to her other little  baby.&#160;Martha gave her Post Abortion brochures to help her to get forgiveness  &amp; healing for what she did.&#160; She also mentioned abstinence to her. &#160;She also  said that she was a Catholic that didn't go to church, so Martha spoke to her  about coming back to the Catholic Church.&#160; She told her that there was a Rosary  in the packet of information that she just received from Martha.&#160; She left  saying "thank you &amp; good bye".&#160; We try to educate our clients in the Truth  so they will heal &amp; be forgiven by Almighty God.&#160; To start over &amp; to do  better with their lives.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">After lunch which was about 2pm the doorbell rang &amp; it was Lynda, our  wonderful volunteer.&#160; We talked for a few minutes &amp; then Martha said that  she was headed out to the front lines.&#160; I said "here are some DVD's to take with  you along with the Truth packets that you already have".&#160; I gave her a small bag  to put those things into &amp; off she went.&#160; I hollered to her to please be  careful.&#160; Then I brought Lynda into the office, to start to work on the letters  for donations, to the parishes.&#160; The letter was already written by her daughter  Lisa, who volunteers on Tuesdays, but she couldn't make it&#160;yesterday for she was  away.&#160; So they needed to be addressed that's when we ran into the problem of  where to sent it to when there are Church Clusters?&#160; What a mess.&#160; So Lynda said  that she would call the Diocese to get more information.&#160; She did.&#160; She bought  the pregnancy center a Diocesan Handbook &amp;&#160;a CD for us, which was $20.&#160;  Wow!!&#160; Thanks Lord &amp; Lynda.&#160; Now I can get the names &amp; address, of the  Priests &amp; their Parishes, to send out the letter correctly.&#160; When I was  waiting for the CD to be instilled, on my computer,&#160;the doorbell ran &amp; Lynda  went to answer it.&#160; When she came back she told me that two young girls were  here for a pregnancy test.&#160; I said "really" &amp; got up from my chair.&#160; I went  to the Green Room where they were sitting &amp; greeted them &amp; introduced  myself to them.&#160; I said that I wanted to do one pregnancy test at a time in the  room, so the one girl said that she would go first.&#160; Lynda sat with the other  girl to talk with her while she waited.&#160; They were cousins.&#160;After she did the  test I told her that she had to wait for 5 minutes &amp; then I started to speak  with&#160;her&#160;about the things on the Intake Sheet.&#160; Then I looked at the results  &amp; said "you're pregnant".&#160; She was shocked.&#160; I asked her what she was afraid  of &amp; she said labor.&#160; I said "please don't worry about that right now,  you'll do fine".&#160; I try to talk to her about many things asking about her  parents &amp; boyfriend.&#160; Then I went I got her many brochures to give to her to  take with her &amp; told her that we will call her at time to see how she's  doing &amp; to call me anytime if she has any worries or concerns.&#160; She wasn't  abortion minded or adoption minded &amp; said that she will take the  responsibility that she needed to.&#160; She also said that her mother, when she was  her age, had an abortion &amp; regretted it something awful.&#160; I asked her if  she'd like an ultrasound &amp; she said "yes", so I called Dee &amp; set up an  appointment for her for next Wednesday at 1pm.&#160; I asked her to call me if she  has to cancel &amp; she said that she would.&#160; I tried to give her lots of  support &amp; said that all will be fine.&#160; Don't worry.&#160; I went to get her  cousin, into the room, to have her do her pregnancy test.&#160; She was nervous.&#160; I  asked her if it was okay that Lynda was in the room too &amp; she said "yes, it  was fine".&#160; She was negative, so I had a long talk with her &amp; gave her  appropriate brochures,&#160;to take with her.&#160; They both thanked us &amp; left.&#160; In  my prayers.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul was now in the center &amp; I was glad to see him.&#160; He went to work  right away cleaning our toy donations.&#160; Then Martha returned&#160; from the front  lines safely.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was Sandy, she&#160;came to help us out  too.&#160; Great!!&#160; Lynda had to go &amp; said that she won't be here next week  because she'll be in California&#160;visiting her sister, so she'll see us hopefully  in&#160;two weeks, unless her boss wants her to do some overtime, then she'll see us  in three weeks.&#160; We'll see what will&#160;happen.&#160; We'll miss you Lynda but&#160;have fun  &amp; be safe.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha told me that Planned Parenthood was doing abortions today.&#160; My heart  sank.&#160; I wish that&#160;there were more people, out on the front lines, to pray &amp;  to speak to the girls going in there.&#160; It saves lives.&#160; Maybe someday  hopefully.&#160; She did speak to two girls &amp; gave&#160;both a Truth packet &amp; one  girl she gave&#160;two DVD's too.&#160; Then she said that one girl came out of Planned  Parenthood &amp; spoke with Martha &amp; then went back into Planned Parenthood  to get her friend out of there.&#160;&#160;When she came back&#160;out they were together &amp;  the mom told Martha that she was having twins &amp; couldn't kill them.&#160;  Martha&#160;&amp; I are glad that she didn't.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul &amp; Sandy left &amp; I then received a call from the&#160;Zion, one of  our Elim girls, saying that they got lost &amp; were heading back to the campus  for it was too late to come to Focus this evening.&#160; They went a&#160;different way  &amp; got lost.&#160; I said that we'll see them next week &amp; she said that&#160;they  will, for sure.&#160; Things happen!&#160; Martha &amp; I were&#160;finishing supper when the  doorbell rang around 6:45pm &amp; it was the hairdresser at the salon two door  down for us in the strip mall.&#160; She wanted to ask me if we needed children's  clothes &amp; I said "yes we sure could use them for our clients children".&#160; She  said that&#160;she will gather them up &amp; then bring them to us when she&#160;could.&#160; I  said "thank you so much".&#160; I then&#160;went back into the Green Room to talk with  Martha &amp; then the doorbell rang again.&#160; It was Elaine, our Board Member,  dropping off the paper &amp; envelopes&#160;for Focus.&#160; How nice of her to&#160;print them  up for us for 'free'.&#160; Martha &amp; I got to talk with&#160;her for about 15 minutes  &amp; she told us that her daughter was&#160;engaged to get married&#160;to&#160;her longtime  boyfriend in&#160;August.&#160; How wonderful!&#160; She said that she was asked, by her  daughter, to walk her down the aisle &amp; she accepted.&#160; How wonderful!!&#160; She  was a happy mom, to say the least.&#160; She had to go to visit her 98 year old mom  &amp; to read to her &amp; to talk with her.&#160; How sweet!!&#160; &#160;It was great seeing  her again.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /></font></div></span></span></strong></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong>&#160;<span id="SPAN2" style="font-size: 16px;"><span id="TextLabel" style="font-size: 16px;">Heavenly Father, help me to see that the earthly goods are nothing  when compared to the eternal treasures you long to give us.

We'll have to change the ceiling title at another day.&#160; I also called Joe  to tell him that I will sent him the packet of information that I promised him  for his client &amp; our client too.&#160; I was hopeful that he'd be at church today  so that I could give it to him directly&#160;but he wasn't, so I'll send&#160;it to him.&#160;  I then went out to the Front Lines to start counseling.&#160; I greeted my team  members &amp; spoke with Sheila for a few minutes before she had to go.&#160; Mike  &amp; Tom stayed with me so that I wouldn't be alone.&#160; Martha didn't come until  1:30pm.&#160; When she arrived I went into the center to speak with Dr. Karen.&#160; I  asked her if she would call the clients, because Suzanne called me earlier, to  say that she was called in on her day off, for an emergency meeting, due to the  illness of her boss. &#160;So I knew that she wasn't coming in again &amp; I wanted  our clients to be called to see how they were doing.&#160;&#160;Karen said that she would  call&#160;&amp; she did.&#160; Thanks Karen!&#160; I ate my hamburger fast &amp; then went back  outside. </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I called out to the people, going in &amp;

asked me what was going on here.&#160; I  said what Planned Parenthood does to children, in their mother's womb's, by  killing them.&#160; I also told her that they were Racist to the African American  Race.&#160; She took the Truth packet &amp; two informative DVD's.&#160; I then told her  about, Focus Pregnancy Help Center, which is two doors down the street &amp;  told her that everything was 'free', for her &amp; her grandson who was with his  mother in the back seat of the car.&#160; I directed her over to Focus &amp; Paul  helped her with things for her family.&#160; She was grateful &amp; so was I.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Francis came by to pray &amp;

when I returned back  to the sidewalk a woman was hollering at Martha.&#160; She was a nasty woman.&#160; She  got into her car with two men in the back seat &amp; when she was about to pull  our of the driveway she decided to come out of the car &amp; confront us on the  sidewalk.&#160; She told Martha to "shut up" &amp; I told her not to talk to this  wonderful woman like that".&#160; She was so vulgar, so I said "just go away".&#160; She  replied that she was standing in the right place &amp; she could stay there".&#160;  Then she said&#160;"it's not a baby until born".&#160; I said "you were lied to, for  that's not correct".&#160; She then took out the condoms, in a brown paper bag,&#160;that  she just got at Planned Non- Parenthood &amp; hit her butt, to show disrespect to  us.&#160; I suggested to Martha not to talk with her but she said that she wanted to  &amp; she did.&#160; When the woman got back into the car she rubbed her breasts,  which I don't know why she did that.&#160; Then she started to mock God &amp; I said  "good bye lady".&#160; As she was driving away I told her again that it was a baby  before he or she was born.&#160; Martha &amp; I think that she might have had an  abortion, in the past, &amp; was now triggered by what she saw on the sidewalk,  with our graphic signs.&#160; I wish that we could have helped her today &amp; maybe  we did, through the grace of God.&#160; You shall know the Truth &amp;

a baby in a  stroller in the small room, getting things for their families.&#160; I was introduced  to the one woman &amp; was told that she was pregnant.&#160; Martha suggested, that I  have her fill out an Intake Sheet, so I brought her into the Counseling Room.&#160; She  said to me "I can't have anymore children for I can't afford it".&#160; I quickly  replied back to her "so you kill someone if you can't afford to feed him".&#160; I  then went on to educate her some more.&#160; She wanted an ultrasound test so I  called over to Embracing Options to schedule one for tomorrow.&#160; She was happy  that I did make an appointment&#160;for her &amp; so was her friend.&#160; After I showed  her some graphic pictures of aborted babies I then gave her many brochures, some  on adoption,&#160;&amp; three DVD's to take with her.&#160; I know that she will be okay.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span></strong></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul came to help us at Focus today &amp;

When I hurried to get into Focus to do my work  the doorbell rang &amp; it was a mother &amp; her two children &amp; her  mother.&#160; The pregnant woman said that they were looking for Focus on University  Ave. for a&#160;

she said in a couple of days &amp; she's a girl.&#160; I replied back  to her that when the baby is born you can come back to get a Layette for&#160;your  baby.&#160; She smiled &amp; left.&#160; I did some other things &amp;

I completed 15 &amp; sent them out in the mail.&#160; Dan came today  which was great!&#160; I greeted him &amp; then put him to work.&#160; I asked Paul &amp;  Dan to fix the ceiling in the Great Room which they did.&#160; After they worked so  hard on it, it started to leak again.&#160; Darn. It just will have to drip.&#160; Then by  the power of the Holy Spirit I got up from my office chair &amp; asked Martha,  Dan &amp; Paul to start to work in the new room up the hall.&#160; They did &amp; it  looks great.&#160; A lot of heavy work, that I let the men do.&#160; Martha was nervous  about her 11th. grandchild to be born very soon &amp; she was in another world.&#160;  The two Elim girls came without the other girl who has strep throat.&#160; She'll get  treatment tomorrow, I was told.&#160; They&#160; worked in getting the books in order  &amp; putting the Women's Clothes in many baskets so that they could be seen  better.&#160; The rooms look good, thank God.&#160;

 she didn't call me to cancel.&#160; I was concerned because she was abortion minded,  unfortunately.&#160; She couldn't reach her she said later to me.&#160; I'll keep on  trying.&#160; Then Rob came &amp; I asked him to go to the front lines &amp; that  I'll be there soon.&#160; When I went into the Ladies Room I noticed that the seat  was up, so I knew that a man had used our bathroom again but I'll deal with this  at another time.&#160; I said "good bye" to Karen &amp; then headed out to the  sidewalk.&#160; There was Mike V., who was there earlier, so he had to go soon.&#160; Then  that left Rob &amp; I to counsel.&#160; I spoke to them going in &amp; coming out  &amp; Rob spoke to them as they got out of their car &amp; walked into the  devil's camp, Planned Parenthood.&#160; I spoke to a young girl that was walking up  the sidewalk &amp; I gave her a Truth packet but she walked right into Planned  Parenthood.&#160; When she came out about an hour &amp; a half later I tried to talk  to her again but she just kept on walking.&#160; I don't even know if she still had  the Truth packet or if it was in her back pack.&#160;

I said  "okay but please put down the toilet seat when finished".&#160; Then the taxi man got  upset &amp; said that&#160;all should use both bathrooms or for me to put a lock on  the door.&#160; Oh no, I thought, I can't get away from the war zone.&#160; I said that  you have&#160;been using the bathroom down the hall for years now&#160;so please continue  &amp; I don't want the Ladies Room door locked, why should it be locked just  don't use it.&#160; I then said that we are a pregnancy center so we want a nice  clean room for our clients.&#160; I thought that would be it but it wasn't.&#160; Then he  said that he paid for the lock to the main door but so many people have the key  to get into the building.&#160; I said that I have the right as the director of Focus  to give the key to our permanent workers.&#160;I reassured him that no strangers  have&#160;keys to Focus. &#160;I then said I was sorry &amp; lets just&#160;let this all  go&#160;&amp; not fight any more.&#160; He agreed.&#160; When I went back outside I was told by  Martha &amp; Rob that a man had stopped &amp; said "you can't have a mega phone  &amp; these pictures are bad, I'm calling the police" &amp; he took out his  phone &amp; started to dial.&#160; I said that I was going back in the center to get  the Injunction &amp; I'll be right back.&#160; I retrieved the document &amp; waited  but no police car came .&#160;

I know that sounds selfish but I really  do need her at Focus.&#160; It was her decision not mine.&#160; When we got to the center  after Mass we did some work &amp; I made a chicken lunch with chips.&#160; Then the  doorbell rang &amp; Martha answered it &amp; then did a pregnancy test.&#160; The  mother of the daughter was controlling &amp; she said that she had an abortion  at Wortman's, the Brighton abortionist,&#160;a long time ago after being raped.&#160;&#160;"I  was young", she said.&#160; Well it doesn't matter you still had this human being,  which you were the mother, killed.&#160; Martha didn't think that she had much  remorse about what she had done.&#160; Rape does not justify abortion.....nothing  does, for it's always Evil.&#160; Her daughter was negative, thank God, because the  family history is still there to repeat itself again.&#160; The only thing to break a  family pattern or sin is YOU!&#160; Just don't repeat what was done, that was not  good, in your family, handle it with prayer.&#160; Martha did say that she took the  Truth package &amp; we hope &amp; pray that will have her to&#160;'come around' to  her past so she can repent &amp; be forgiven by God, who she offended.&#160; And to  seek out forgiveness,&#160;for her child, who she had killed.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I went into the office to do the letters to the  parishes asking for donations to Focus.&#160;
