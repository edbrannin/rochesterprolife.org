Mass.&#160; We managed though.&#160; The  tables were set up by the men at yesterday's Focus Fund-raiser meeting so that  helped.&#160; I received a call from the new woman who comes to Focus from Fidelis  Care for our clients,&#160;saying that she was going to be coming in a little later,  for she was at a meeting in Buffalo &amp; the meeting went late.&#160; I said "we'll  see you when you get here".&#160; She arrived about 30 minutes later today &amp; set  herself up in the Rose Room, where we do the pregnancy tests.&#160; Our client who  suffers with migraines saw the insurance counselor today.&#160; Martha was at her  daughter'&#160;father-in-law's&#160;funeral Mass &amp; will come when she can.&#160; It was  nice of Kathryn,&#160;who comes in on&#160;Thursdays, came in to

brought them into the Green Room &amp; did one at a time.&#160;  The first was a fifteen year old rape survivor from a rape in June.&#160; She was  negative but if she was positive she would very much consider abortion.&#160; I told  her my story that I conceived twins by a rape at Strong&#160; Hospital in 1971 &amp;  miscarried them.&#160; I told her that I named them &amp; I wouldn't have had an  abortion. Abortions were being done here in New York back then.&#160; All life is  precious &amp; it's always evil.&#160; She looked at me &amp; said "that's your  opinion".&#160; I looked at her &amp; said "no, it's not my opinion but it's the  TRUTH, it's ALWAYS wrong".&#160; I asked her if she loved God &amp; she said "yes".&#160;I  said then "how could you kill a baby that God just created"?&#160; I mentioned  adoption &amp; she said "I don't believe in adoption"!&#160; I said "you don't  believe in giving your&#160; baby to a loving husband &amp; wife but you believe in  killing your child"?&#160; Something's wrong with her belief system. &#160;I told her the  abuse, that she's experiencing in her home, is not okay &amp; she needs not to  accept it but to report it, so it would stop.&#160; I talked to her for a long time  &amp; then gave her lots&#160;of information &amp; a paper with some numbers for her  to call to get counseling for her victimization.&#160; She said that she had been  drinking before the rape.&#160; I said "it wasn't your fault even if you walked naked  down the street, no one should touch you. It's their fault, not yours".&#160; "Don't  accept this abuse as normal, for you are precious to the Lord, who cried when  you were being attacked".&#160; She smiled at me.&#160; I&#160;told her that we could be  sisters for we share some experiences together.&#160; I hope that helped her to feel  not alone.&#160; So many women &amp; girls have been raped or molested ....... how  sad &amp; evil!&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;">&#160;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Then the other young girl, who was also fifteen years  old,&#160;came&#160;in to have her pregnancy test done.&#160; The test was immediately  positive.&#160; I knew that I needed to talk to her right away to save this baby's  life.&#160;I&#160;offered her a free ultrasound at His Branches, but she said that  Wednesday afternoons were not good for her, so I gave her a brochure for Compass  Care, for her to call if she wanted a free ultrasound. I asked what she planned  to do, either parenting or adoption.&#160; She said "I'm not sure what I'm going to  do".&#160; That sends chills down my back.&#160; I talked to her &amp; gave her a Truth  packet &amp; lots of other information &amp; three DVD's&#160; too.&#160; She said that  she was dating this boy for about a year.&#160; I said dating doesn't require sexual  intercourse but since you big enough to do that then your big enough to be a  mother.&#160; Her sister-friend came into the room &amp; was told.&#160; I looked at her  &amp; said "you need to support her in her pregnancy".&#160; She smiled at me nicely  &amp; said "yes I will".&#160; I said "don't go to Planned Parenthood,&#160; for they are  killing off your Race &amp;&#160;your baby should not be killed".&#160; The DVD, Mafaa 21,</span></span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><font face="Arial"><a href="http://maafa21.com/"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">http://maafa21.com/</span></span></a></font></span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;, was given to her too.&#160;  So&#160;much information is in this video.&#160; I hope this precious baby will be saved  from being killed by abortion!!!!!&#160; Parenting or adoption!&#160; The only two choices...........<br /></span></span></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;">&#160;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br /></strong></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> </strong></span></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Some pregnancy tests are so difficult.&#160; After I try so  hard, to save the baby's life, I have to give the woman or girl to the Lord, who  can change their hearts &amp; minds if they are abortion minded, through our  prayers.&#160; I also pray to God's mother Mary ,for her to send graces from the  Lord, to the women &amp; girls.&#160; The family &amp; society are so wounded by  abortion :(&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The doorbell kept on ringing &amp; we were busy &amp; the  center was set up differently because of the Mass this evening.&#160; We had a client  who is pregnant &amp; didn't want to go home &amp; stayed for the Mass &amp; one  of the moms brought her home.&#160; I gave her the two referral lists for her to call  some one who can help her with her situation at home.&#160; Mothers or anybody,  should not verbally abuse, anyone! </strong></span></span></div></font></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><div><strong><br /></strong></div></div></span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha came at 3:30pm with the food for our supper  tonight.&#160; Kathryn had to leave &amp; we'll see her again in three weeks because  she &amp; her husband will be going on a Pilgrimage to Rome.&#160; Can't wait till  she returns.&#160; The people started to arrive &amp; then Fr.

Sheila had to leave but before  she did she took out some big items from her car that she picked up at the  Garage Sale in Hilton.&#160; While she was in the center she heard the conflict of  the two girls, for they were walking with two children &amp;

 said I almost didn't.&#160; We will help her again with more things as she gets  closer to her due date.&#160; I gave her a list of the other Pregnancy Centers&#160;so  they could help her too.&#160;

I went downtown to join other pro  lifers in a group discussion of many different topics.&#160; It's lead by Jim Harden,  the director&#160;of Compass Care.&#160; The other pregnancy centers too send&#160;their  clients to them for 'free' ultrasounds.&#160; It was a fruitful meeting that started  at 9:30 am to 1:30 pm.&#160; After the meeting&#160;Martha &amp; I &amp; Rick went to  Focus, for we had an appointment with Dan, our landlord, to see the banquet room  three doors from us for the '40&#160;Days for Life' Kick off Rally'.&#160; &#160;We were hoping  that the area would be bigger, than Focus, for this event.&#160;It was.&#160; The room was  beautiful &amp; it will work out perfectly.&#160; He was giving us a great deal too.&#160;  Rick was happy &amp; so were we.&#160; I received a call on my cell phone &amp; it  was a woman who wanted the DVD.&#160; I said that I would be at the center at 2pm  &amp; for her to stop by to get it.&#160; She came while I was in the banquet room  but I left to go back to Focus.&#160; I went to the Rose Room &amp; got the DVD video  &amp; gave it to her.&#160; She said "this isn't the one I wanted it's called  Mafaa:21".&#160; I said okay just a moment &amp; went back into the room to get it  for her &amp; another video too.&#160; I went&#160;back to her&#160;with an extra two DVD's so  she received three informative videos for educational purposes.&#160; Then we began  to talk.&#160; Oh my!&#160; She said that she read about Mafaa:21 in the Psychology Today  magazine &amp; she was talking about it &amp; a friend said that she got one  from us at Focus.&#160; She wanted it for a term paper.&#160; Then she said that Strong  Memorial Hospital was inept years ago.&#160; She had a problem with her twin  pregnancy &amp; was C- Sectioned in the basement of the hospital.&#160; Her son got  Septicemia &amp; the one son&#160;died two months later.&#160; She wasn't sure if he ever  received the medicine, the other son who was lighter, received.&#160; She didn't  blame God for she knows that he is with Him in Heaven &amp; she wants to be with  the Lord &amp; her&#160;son someday.&#160; Wow!!!&#160;&#160; What a testimony.&#160; I asked her if she  would ever share this&#160;testimony in a group setting &amp; she said that she  would.&#160; I might call her some day.&#160; She was a very nice woman &amp; I was  blessed by her love &amp; trust in the Lord.&#160; I told her my testimony about  Strong Hospital.&#160; After she left another woman came into the center with&#160;her  child in a&#160; stroller.&#160; Martha got to talk with her to find out that she was a  victim of Domestic Violence.&#160;&#160; She wants an Order of Protection &amp; the police  are looking for him to serve him the papers.&#160; She went into the Rose Room to  fill out the Fidelis Care Insurance from for me to fax&#160;over to them.&#160; I asked  her if her phone number was a good number that she could be reached at &amp; she  said that it was.&#160; I told her that I knew a woman Mrs. Smith that I would give  her phone number to &amp; she will call you to help you.&#160; She said "okay".&#160;  After she left I called Pat Smith &amp; gave her the information &amp; the phone  number for her to call&#160; our client to start the healing process.&#160; It was a few  minutes later while I was faxing over the application that she had filled out  that the phone number was&#160;not in use.&#160; Here we go again :(&#160;&#160;the phone number  dilemma, when you want to reach the client but can't!!!!!!!!!&#160; Pat said that  when she comes back again just give her my cell number so she can call me if she  wants.&#160; Okay Pat that will work out better.&#160; I don't know what Fidelis Care will  do with&#160;no phone number, maybe&#160;they will send her the information.&#160; I hope that  she gave us the correct address.&#160; We want to help her....it's so frustrating at  times.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The doorbell rang again &amp;

As she was in the car  I asked how did it go this morning &amp; she told me that there is a man holding  a sign 'Support Planned Parenthood' standing with the '40 Days for Life'  people.&#160; Chris a young man she said tried to witness to him but he still stayed  doing&#160; what he was doing :(&#160; I said "thanks for telling me Sheila &amp; have a  great&#160; afternoon".&#160; My heart sank &amp; I walked over to the sidewalk to see him  standing there by the tree.&#160; I greeted&#160;both Tom &amp; Kathleen &amp; them walked  over to the older man &amp; said "I just want&#160; you to know that&#160;I'm praying for  you".&#160; He said back "no need to".&#160; I then said "you're wrong", &amp;

her&#160;son  in law, in another State.&#160; We'll see her next Thursday.&#160; Paul wasn't here yet  but I know that he'll show up later, for he's helping to set up for the Mass  tonight.&#160; Martha was going to Angel Care, in&#160;Henrietta, to pick up some items  for our clients then she was going to pick up her friend for the Mass, then come  to Focus.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp;it was our new volunteer Becky, a  student&#160;at&#160;Geneseo College who we met at the Life Chain in October.&#160; I greeted  her &amp; put her to work.&#160; I know that this sounds rude but we were so busy.&#160;  She took a bag of clothes &amp; started to work on it sorting the clothes then  putting them into the baskets in the appreciate rooms.&#160; I ordinate her to our  center on Sunday after the Life Chain so she knew where to go with the clothes.&#160;  She was such a trooper &amp; I did appreciate all her work.&#160; She said that she  would be coming back next week &amp; I hope that we will see her  again.</span></span></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I received a phone call on my cell &amp;  it was a pro life woman who I&#160;know asking if we, the people at the '40 Days for  Life' campaign can hand out just the pens which have a pregnancy testing number  on it rather than the truth packets to the people that they meet on the  sidewalk.&#160; I said "no, the packet has so much great information in it &amp; we  need to have the girl's receive it, for we may never see them again".&#160; She said  back to me :we'll see them again".&#160; I stated back that we probably won't.&#160; I  then suggested that we put the pen into the plastic bag that holds the  many&#160;brochures.&#160; She wasn't thrilled with that idea but I did it anyway.&#160; So  much conflict with so many people.&#160; She sounded a bit upset but I hope later on  she will realize what I'm trying to do too.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I was told that this young lady who  just came into Focus wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I asked her to go into the Rose  Room &amp; I was walking behind her to have her fill out the Intake Sheet.&#160; She  said that she wasn't feeling well &amp; didn't want to fill out the&#160;paper but I  told her that this information will help us to service her better.&#160; She filled  out the questions.&#160; I suggested that she sees her doctor about her health issue  &amp; she said that she had an appointment with a doctor this afternoon.&#160; I  asked where, for I was afraid that she'd say Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said it  was the Anthony Jordan Health Clinic.&#160; I was relieved to hear this.&#160; She did the  test &amp; it was negative.&#160; I had noticed that she had put&#160;down that&#160;she had  had an abortion so I gave her some brochures relating to the past abortion &amp;  talked with her for a few minutes too.&#160; When I opened up the door there was one  of our long time clients standing there asking if she was pregnant for she was  her friend &amp; she wanted to be the Godmother.&#160; The young lady said that she  was negative.&#160; The&#160;our client said that she had brought her into Focus for the  test.&#160; I said "thank you".&#160; Then I said are you going to the doctors now &amp;  she said "yes" &amp; off they both went out the door.&#160; Lynda came in from the  front lines to tell me that they both went into Planned Parenthood!&#160; "What" I  said, they told me that they were going the Jordan Health Clinic because&#160;her  head was hurting her so badly.&#160; Lynda said that&#160;she had spoken to them as they  were walking into the death mill &amp; one of the girls&#160;said "we're not pregnant  so we're no killing anyone they do other things too".&#160; Yeah, they give you  contraception which DOES kill your unborn baby &amp; you too,&#160;sometimes.&#160;Please  be a good parent!!!!&#160;&#160; I will speak to our long time client when she comes back  into Focus, for things, for her precious young daughter.&#160; I'm not sure what to  do at this time but I'm thinking of banning her from Focus for two months....not  sure yet.&#160; It was about five months ago that Martha told me that she went into  the Rose Room &amp; took&#160;a pregnancy out of the box &amp; went into the bathroom  &amp; did it there.&#160; Not acceptable!&#160; I should have confronted her when she came  back the next time &amp; banned her from the center for&#160;we don't accept stealing  or bad behavior at the pregnancy center.&#160; Maybe it's time but I don't want her  to go to Planned Parenthood.&#160; Come Holy Spirit &amp; guide me with this young  lady.</span></span></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I called Pat, our grandmother &amp;

I  were there today &amp; Linda came at 4:30pm to help us out with our clients  &amp; putting away the donations.&#160; We were very busy with lots to do.&#160; The  office work &amp; the incoming &amp; outgoing phone calls keeps me busy.&#160; It was  later in the evening when the doorbell rang &amp; I saw our pregnant client at  the door.&#160; I let her in nervously &amp; spoke with her for a few minutes before  doing other things.&#160; She said that Donna was going to come to pick her up so I  felt better about her now.&#160; She looked in both material aid rooms &amp; roamed  around.&#160; Trying to talk to her is difficult at times.&#160; Donna came &amp; there  was a misunderstanding.&#160; Our client thought that Donna was going to take her to  her house for the night but Donna said "no, that won't work out".&#160; Our client  was upset &amp; we tried to talk with her to rectify this problem of where she  is going to go, for the night.&#160; She said that her boyfriend, the father of this  baby &amp; her other child, which someone is caring for, is in jail.&#160; She left  her protected shelter in a nice area to go live with him in a bad area??&#160; So  Donna said that she would take her to the apartment for the night.&#160; The director  of the shelter told Donna that our client could re register with her again to  hopefully be put back into the shelter.&#160; It's up to the young lady to what she  wants for herself&#160;&amp; her precious baby.&#160; Will she choose: the good or the  bad??&#160; It's so difficult to reason with some people.&#160; She sat there &amp; said  to me "can you buy me a house"?&#160; I looked at her puzzled &amp; said "yes &amp;  then you can buy me one".&#160; The she looked puzzled back at me.&#160; This is the kind  of talk that was going on tonight not resolving the many problems that she has.&#160;  She doesn't like the rules in the shelter though provides safety for her &amp;  her baby.&#160; I then said "if you don't care about yourself then please care about  her baby".&#160; Martha &amp; I then said "good bye" to both Donna &amp; our client  &amp; off they went to Jay St..&#160; We then made supper &amp; was eating at 7pm  when the doorbell rang.&#160; Martha answered the door &amp; in came Donna &amp; Miss  N..&#160; What had happened??&#160; Apparently our client didn't want to be in the  apartment so she asked Donna&#160;to take her back to Focus.&#160; Not a good idea girls.&#160;  What were we suppose to do&#160; now??&#160; We tried to talk with her but it was like  talking to a wall.....no good answers to all the questions that we had for her.&#160;  We suggested that she call the Emergency Shelter number so I gave it to her  &amp; she called.&#160; It went back &amp; forth with the two of them &amp; then she  hung up.&#160; I quickly asked her why she had hung up &amp; she said "because she  had me on hold".&#160; Are you kidding me.&#160; My heart was beating faster.&#160; I then said  to her "it's 8pm &amp; you have no where to go &amp; it doesn't seem to bother  you, why not"?&#160; No real answer.&#160; She then went in to the Rose Room &amp; closes  the door.&#160; Before Donna left I asked her to call 911 &amp; have the police stop  by &amp; maybe that they could help her.&#160; She did &amp; then she left to go home  which is about 45 minutes away.&#160; I waited for the police car to arrive &amp; I  received a phone call from the 911 dispatcher saying that they didn't know where  to go &amp; if I was in the place.&#160; I gave the address again&amp; said "yes, I'm  here at the center".&#160; I walked outside to see a police car coming out of Planned  Parenthood's parking lot coming towards me in our parking lot.&#160; I told the  operator that they found where we were &amp; all is fine &amp; then I said <font size="2"><font face="Arial">"</font></font>thank  you"&#160;&amp; "good bye" &amp; hung up.&#160; I greeted the two police officers who  came in the center &amp; told them what was happening.&#160; Then I knocked on the  Rose Room door &amp; opened it &amp; said to our client that Officer Murray  wanted to speak to you.&#160; She looked surprise which is expected &amp; they both  went in &amp; I closed the door.&#160; The doorbell rang again &amp; it was Pat, our  grandmother &amp; great grandmother, came in the door.&#160; We sat her down in the  Green Room &amp; she went on saying that she was going to live in a tent on the  corner of Frost Ave. &amp; Jefferson St. for nine day &amp; nights for her  children.&#160; I couldn't believe this all was happening tonight.&#160; I strongly said  that this was not safe &amp; that I hoped that she wouldn't do it.&#160; She said  that she was going ahead with this mission.&#160; What has she been drinking????&#160; She  left before the police men came out of the Rose Room. They were in there  speaking to&#160;our pregnant client&#160;for about 15 minutes &amp; then came out to  speak to Martha &amp; I in the Green Room.&#160; They were perplexed too.&#160; They  called for an emergency team to come to assess the situation but they were all  tied up so it would be a very long wait &amp; they couldn't wait much longer  &amp; either could we.&#160; So we decided to have her go back to the apartment on  Jay St. because she did have a place to stay &amp; that's what the emergency  team would tell her to do.&#160; I called for a taxi &amp; Focus paid for it &amp;  off she went back to the prison that she choose for her baby &amp; herself.&#160;  Tomorrow is another day &amp; I hope &amp; pray that she made better choices for  herself &amp; her innocent baby.&#160; Lord have Mercy!</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></strong></span></div><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font size="2"><font size="2"> </font></font></span></p><div align="center"><font size="2"><font size="2">&#160;</font></font></div><p><font size="2"><font size="2"> </font></font><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> <hr /><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;</p><div align="center"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span id="TitleLabel" style="font-weight: bold;">'Christian Community'</span> <br /><br /><span id="SPAN2"><span id="TextLabel">To  be a Christian is to be in community, working, praying, learning, and serving  with others.
