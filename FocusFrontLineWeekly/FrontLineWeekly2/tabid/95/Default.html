East Room</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;9:01 A.M. EST</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">THE PRESIDENT: Nellie, good to be with you -- we're fellow West Texans who care deeply about the value of human life. Other members of the board of directors for the March for Life, leaders of the pro-life community, and all those who are here with us for the march, it's good to have you here and welcome to the White House. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">As I look out at you, I'll see some folks who have been traveling all night to get here -- (laughter) -- you're slightly bleary-eyed. (Laughter.) I'll see others who are getting ready for a day out in the cold. But mostly I see faces that shine with a love for life. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">I see people with a deep conviction that even the most vulnerable member of the human family is a child of God. You're here because you know that all life deserves to be protected. And as you begin your march, I'm proud to be standing with you. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Thirty-five years ago today the United States Supreme Court declared and decided that under the law an unborn child is not considered a person. But we know many things about the unborn. Biology confirms that from the start each unborn child is a separate individual with his or her own genetic code. Babies can now survive outside the mother's womb at younger and younger ages. And the fingers and toes and beating hearts that we can see on an unborn child's ultrasound come with something that we cannot see: a soul. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Today we're heartened -- we're heartened by the news that the number of abortions is declining. But the most recent data reports that more than one in five pregnancies end in an abortion. America is better than this, so we will continue to work for a culture of life where a woman with an unplanned pregnancy knows there are caring people who will support her; where a pregnant teen can carry her child and complete her education; where the dignity of both the mother and child is honored and cherished.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We aspire to build a society where each one of us is welcomed in life and protected in law. We haven't arrived, but we are making progress. Here in Washington we passed good laws that promote adoption and extend legal protection to children who are born despite abortion attempts. We came together to ban the cruel practice of partial birth abortion. (Applause.) And in the past year we have prevented that landmark law from being rolled back.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We've seen the dramatic breakthroughs in stem cell research that it is possible to advance medical science while respecting the sanctity of life. (Applause.) Building a culture of life requires more than law; it requires changing hearts. And as we reach out to others and find common ground, we can see the glimmerings of a new America on a far shore. This America is rooted in our belief that in a civilized society, the strong protect the weak. This America is nurtured by people like you, who speak up for the weak and the innocent. This America is the destiny of a people whose founding document speaks of the right to life that is a gift of our Creator, not a grant of the state. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">My friends, the time is short and your march is soon. (Laughter.) As you give voice to the voiceless I ask you to take comfort from this: The hearts of the American people are good. (Applause.) Their minds are open to persuasion. And our history shows that a cause rooted in human dignity and appealing to the best instincts of the American people cannot fail. So take heart. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Take heart, be strong, and go forth. May God bless you. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">END 9:10 A.M.

We ran out of boy clothing but we have lots of girl clothes,&#160; More boys than girls lately.&#160; We put an SOS to our friend Amy, at the Catholic Courier, to see if she could put a blurb in the newspaper to request the general public in giving baby clothes to our Pregnancy Center.&#160; Hope she &amp; others will come through for our clients.&#160; Our client came in and received the baby clothes for her baby who will be born in June.&#160;She was so grateful &amp; I asked her to bring the baby bye&#160;after he is born.&#160;

I offered her a stuffed animal at the Center &amp; she &amp; I walked to it.&#160; She picked out a stuffed brown bear from the basket &amp; I had 3 knitted hats for her &amp; she picked out the dark pink one.&#160;

I said "shame on you".&#160; She told me to "shut up" and then used a word I cannot print here.&#160; I again said "shame on you" and said that we have a first amendment right to speak.&#160; I am sad that that she was so angry that she didn't get the help that she needed &amp;

When the girls came out they rolled down their window to tell me that there were not in there for an Abortion but for Birth Control.&#160;&#160;I told them that&#160;Birth Control&#160;kills babies early on.&#160;&#160;The girl passenger &#160;said a few choice words to me &amp;

So I invited him to go to Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church on Sunday for the Mass @ 10 AM.&#160; He said that he would, I only hope so.&#160; The Blessed Mother is watching over her beloved son Anthony.&#160; I know how he feels over his losses.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">After he left a young woman came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walked over to Martha &amp; I &amp; apologized for being nasty when she had walked by the pro lifers, on the sidewalk earlier.&#160; She said that the pictures bothered her that she had had an abortion in the past &amp; didn't want to feel guilty.&#160; I said that you should for you took the life of another human being but that God does forgives &amp; heals.&#160; I said that if you don't come to the realization of what you did you won't be healed.&#160; Martha told her that she was not alone.&#160; I mentioned Project Rachel (a post abortive ministry for healing the wounds of abortion) to her &amp; handed her a Truth packet &amp; I &#160;told her&#160;that&#160;the brochure&#160;was at the end of all the materials.&#160; I didn't want to lose her but I also needed to tell her the Truth not to take what she did so lightly&#160;but I&#160;also wanted&#160;to&#160;give her Hope&#160;for her future.&#160; I looked sternly but loving&#160;at her &amp; she thanked us &amp; walked away.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that&#160;she will call Project Rachel.&#160; &#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Just after she left&#160;I saw&#160;2 people, a man&#160;and a woman,&#160;walking&#160;on the other side of the sidewalk&#160;across&#160;the street.&#160; As always we usually call out to people to ask them if they would like a prayer Rosary.&#160; Usually they cross the street &amp; come over to us to receive one.&#160; This was no exception.&#160; As they were crossing the street the woman was saying something &amp; as they crossed over she asked us what we were all about.&#160; We told her &amp; they agreed.&#160; We told them that PP targets the Black community &amp; that we had information in our packets regarding this.&#160; He &amp; she agreed that PP was targeting them &amp; were upset.&#160; They took 2 Truth packets to help others in the community.&#160; Then the gentleman stated that his girlfriend, in the past, had his child killed.&#160; His voice was going higher &amp; higher &amp; was getting more upset when speaking about it.&#160; I mentioned that there was a brochure in the packet that talked about men who were affected by an abortion.&#160; He felt helpless, like Anthony earlier on,&#160;in saving the lives of their children.&#160; I hope that he also gets the help &amp; healing that he needs&#160;for this terrible pain&#160;from the effects of an&#160;abortion.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Just as this was happening a lady in a car had stopped to talk with Martha &amp; I.&#160; She said that she had driven by many time but now need to get out of her car to talk to us.&#160; She shared that her daughter had had an abortion in the past &amp; how bad it was for her to have found out.&#160; As appalled as she was of her daughter's abortion she shared that, in her 40'es she thought that she was pregnant &amp; was thinking of having an abortion.&#160; Why do women think that by having their baby killed that it will solve all their problems?&#160; Desperate people do desperate things. We must educate women &amp; girls that abortion is not the answer.&#160; That by having the baby &amp; raising the child or giving the baby up for adoption is when they will be happy.&#160; Abortion will make their lives miserable.&#160; She went on to say that the 10 Commandments were written in all our hearts, even if you don't believe in God.&#160; She said that she was once a Catholic but now was a Mormon &amp; was once a Jehovah Witness.&#160; She took a Truth packet with a Rosary in it, I didn't say anything about the Rosary in the bag,&#160;I'll let the Blessed Mother take over in her coming back into the Catholic faith.&#160; We said that we will pray for her &amp; her family, she was so happy to hear this for she said that one of her daughters was in the hospital &amp; the other daughter, who had had&#160;the abortion, was thinking about going back to her ex-husband, the father of her aborted child. She&#160;then&#160;got back into her car &amp; drove away with a big smile on her face.&#160; There is healing in sharing.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A young man, was waiting in the car on the passenger side, in the parking lot of PP for his girlfriend to come out.&#160; The Death Security Guard Jim went over to talk to him, he was smirking.&#160; How sad you are Jim,&#160; When the girl came out she got into the driver's side &amp; pulled out.&#160; As they were leaving I told her that he was only using her &amp; why didn't he marry her, to which he pulled down his pants to moon us (which is against he law). &#160;They were going the opposite&#160;direction otherwise I would have gotten into my car, which is parked on the street facing Downtown, to get their license plate&#160;#.&#160; We'll just pray for them.&#160; At least we got a reaction, they're not dead yet, there is Hope for them.&#160; The stoic&#160;people are the ones that scare me.&#160; They might be dead already,&#160;

were walking towards me on the sidewalk.&#160; As they passed by I asked them if they would want a packet of information.&#160; The one girl said that they were not there for an abortion but for the Pill.&#160; I went on to say that the Pill kills babies earlier on.&#160; They got mad &amp; said that I was crazy.&#160; As they were walking I said to them&#160; "you are killing your baby early on &amp; that Planned Parenthood doesn't want you to know the Truth".&#160; They just hissed &amp; continued to walk down the street.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that the brief information that they received will resonate in their hearts &amp; minds &amp; that they will do the right thing in the future.&#160; As this was happening another young girl came out of PP &amp; walked towards Martha &amp; I.&#160; Her story was that she had sex for the first time &amp; the condom broke &amp; that PP told&#160;her tocome&#160;back on Friday to get the Morning After Pill.&#160; We talked with her for quite awhile &amp; asked her not to come back here on Friday that if she was pregnant then stay that way until the baby is born.&#160; We gave her some phone #'s that she could get help from if she is pregnant.&#160; She took a Truth packet.&#160; She was kind &amp; open to hear the Truth.&#160; Martha got her phone # &amp; will call her in the next day or so to see how she is doing.&#160; Nice girl &amp; we&#160;only hope &amp; pray that she will not make a lasting mess of her life by choosing death for her baby if she is pregnant.&#160; She said that she's only had sex once &amp; I said that it only takes once to get pregnant.&#160; Secondary virginity, is the only way to stop this chain reaction, of this happening again.&#160; Wait until marriage girls, then you will have nothing to worry about.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Anthony, rode by on his bicycle with a flat tire and asked for a ride to work which we couldn't,t do.&#160; Our new friend said okay &amp; rode away on his flat tire.&#160; He was still wearing, around his neck, the yellow rosary I gave him a week ago, hopefully&#160;the rosary&#160;will give him comfort.&#160;&#160;I&#160;only&#160;hope that he is saying the prayers.&#160; Cleveland, our street friend,&#160;came by &amp; asked for food when all this was going on.&#160; Martha gave him a ham sandwich, which she makes ahead of time.&#160;&#160;He thought the bag of baby blankets I was holding, was more food for him.&#160; He has good days &amp; bad days like us all.&#160;The Blessed Mother is looking out for&#160;them &amp;&#160; all of us too.&#160; It was pretty hectic and the situations still continued to be challenging, as the evening progressed.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A short time later I spotted a young girl talking to a young man, they were standing in our parking lot to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; He left &amp; she walked by us.&#160; I offered her a Truth packet &amp; she said "no" &amp; walked right into Planned Parenthood's parking lot &amp; went to the door &amp; walked in.&#160; I was upset as I always am of anyone going into the Killing Mill.&#160; It wasn't long after that she came out &amp; Martha &amp; I started to talk to her again.&#160; She said that she wasn't there for an abortion but for a pregnancy test, which I told her that we do them at the Pregnancy Center.&#160; I invited her to come with me to have one done.&#160; At this time Tucker had gone home &amp; it was Martha &amp; I out there now.&#160; So Martha had to stay by herself on the sidewalk, which is not&#160;a good&#160; situation to be alone on the sidewalk, though we know that God will protect us.&#160; I was with this young girl for&#160;30 minutes&#160;or more,&#160;in the Center.&#160; She gave herself a pregnancy test &amp; I spoke to her about many things.&#160;She went on to tell me of&#160;her very painful story about her life, which some of it I could relate.&#160;She took a Truth packet &amp; other pamphlets that we have in the Pregnancy Center, that can hopefully help her.&#160; I gave her my home phone #&#160;&amp; other phone #'s that can help her, if she needed it.&#160; Life is precious handle with prayer &amp; doing the right thing. &#160;Martha &amp; I&#160;offered her a ride when we came back outside back on the sidewalk &amp; she said that she would be okay.&#160; When she left I felt so&#160;shell shocked for her story was so intense.&#160;&#160;It was a very fruitful &amp; difficult &amp; evening.&#160; We do it out of love &amp; obedience to Almighty God for all that He does for us.&#160; It is required of us as Christians is to help people.&#160; Remember the Corporate Works of Mercy.&#160; I hold these girls &amp; all the girls &amp; guys in my heart &amp; prayers as also does the other faithful members of this pro-life remnant team.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><strong><font size="3"><hr /></font></strong><p><font size="4" color="#0000ff"><strong>Thursday May 29, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p><p><strong><font size="3">Hardly any cars were at Planned Parenthood this afternoon which is always a good thing but we suspect that they may have changed the abortion day on Thursdays to another day because Martha &amp; her team, through the grace of God, have been so faithful &amp; effective in saving lives.&#160; She &amp; her team&#160;are bad for business, thank God.&#160; So the team will discern another day to go out to save lives, instead of Thursdays. &#160;A couple of girls were talked to by Martha &amp; then they went to the doors of Planned Parenthood &amp; then they&#160;turned away.&#160; As they passed her, on the sidewalk, they said that they didn't need a place that kills kids to go to.&#160; They took a Truth packet &amp; in the packet, along with so many different subjects, we have a list of doctors that don't do abortions nor refer abortions.&#160; It's a short clean list of professional doctors who respect life of that of the woman or girl &amp;

there were 3 pro lifers there already witnessing the Truth.&#160; One was Mark, it was so good to see him.&#160; The other 2 men left &amp; there was Mark &amp; me.&#160; Maria was on the other side of Planned Parenthood witnessing the Truth about Planned Parenthood with her sidewalk of stuffed animals &amp; a table with flowers &amp; pictures of a boy &amp; girl.&#160; Maria later told me that a car had stopped &amp; asked who had been murdered there &amp; she replied that it represented all the babies that Planned Parenthood have murdered, over the years.&#160; They were surprised. &#160;What a witness&#160;to the reality to what Planned Parenthood is doing to ending the lives of American children, for $$$$$$.&#160; As&#160;I was settling in on the sidewalk I looked over to the door of Planned Parenthood &amp; noticed that someone had made, on the left side of the door, a graffiti picture of a whatever?&#160; All I know it was&#160;big&#160;&amp; ugly &amp; red.&#160; Maybe they will pant the whole building red for all the innocent&#160;blood that has been shed there.&#160; This is the first time in&#160;22 years that I have protested Planned Parenthood since 1986, before they started doing abortions in 1993, except the 3 years I lived in Florida, that there has been any graffiti on the Building of Death.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A young girl, with a defiant looking face, walked pass&#160;me on the sidewalk.&#160; As she was walking down the street I asked her if she would&#160;like a Truth packet.&#160; She responded that she was pro choice which I replied that she was really&#160;pro death because in her choice a baby is killed.&#160; I said that if she had had an abortion to repent because she'll be miserable until she does.&#160; I looked away briefly &amp; then turned back towards her again. &#160;I noticed that she was walking in the parking lot of our Center&#160;( there are a couple of business there) so I started to walk over to see where she was going.&#160; I won't discuss this any further only to protect the identity of her&#160;parents, who I know.&#160; I'll pray for her &amp; her family to which maybe they are unaware of her stand.&#160; I'm sure that they are also praying for her too.&#160; She is not a happy young girl.&#160; &#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Then there was a confrontation between me &amp; a woman who had dropped off a young girl at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was concerned about the 2 children in the back seat of the car.&#160; I asked if they were in car seats or seat belts &amp; she got real mad at me.&#160;We went back &amp; forth&#160; until I realized that it was no use in getting through to her &amp; I needed to calm down too.&#160;She said that they were older kids &amp; I realized that the children were older &amp; they didn't need a car seat.&#160; She was walking to the door without them &amp; I said that you can't leave them alone in the car.&#160; She used a 4 letter word &amp; I said not to talk like that in front of the kids.&#160; She hollered that I was nuts to the&#160;death security guard Jim.&#160; Little did she know that he was the nutty one.&#160; She left&#160; with the kids in the car with the girl still in PP.&#160; Martha&#160;had now come onto the sidewalk.&#160;&#160;About 15 minutes later&#160;the lady&#160;came back to pick up the young girl she had dropped off earlier.&#160;&#160;We decided that we were not going to speak to her again so as not to agitate her. After a little while the young girl came out.&#160; At this time Mark &amp; Maria &#160;had to go, so it was Martha &amp; I now.&#160; As she was pulling out of the driveway I said to her that we loved her &amp; cared.&#160; She stopped the car in the street.&#160; I went over &amp; said that so many people don't care about their children &amp; that bothers me. &#160;I apologized for over reacting.&#160; She said that she was not one of them.&#160;I offered her a Truth packet &amp; she took it. &#160;She then said that her daughter was pregnant &amp; that they are keeping the baby.&#160; I told her that we had&#160;baby clothes in our Pregnancy Center next door &amp; if she wanted anything just dive over to the parking lot next door.&#160; She said "okay".&#160;Praise God who would figure this scenario would end this way.&#160; Thank you Jesus.&#160; It was by the grace of God that we both calmed down &amp; could talk with each other respectfully. &#160;Martha went over to the Center to give her some baby clothes &amp; I stayed alone on the sidewalk to witness &amp; counsel.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;As I was alone, a young girl walked over to me from across the street.&#160; She said that she has walked by before but was always in a hurry &amp; couldn't stop.&#160; Today she wasn't in a hurry so decided to cross over to look at the pictures.&#160; She was a sensible young lady who expressed that you get married then have sex.&#160; I nearly dropped over. WOW I said.&#160; You have made my day &amp; then some.&#160; She said that she goes to Edison &amp; the nurse said for her to go on the Pill because pregnancy is&#160;high among the Black girls.&#160; She found this statement to be Racist &amp; further more she is NOT sexually active.&#160; I told her that Planned Parenthood &amp; their poison are in the schools corrupting the young girls &amp; guys.&#160; She took a Truth packets &amp; I told her that there was so much info in it.&#160; She also said that she had to do a Community Project, for school &amp; that she would like to do hers here on the sidewalk.&#160; I gave her my phone # for her to contact me when that time comes.&#160; I mentioned that Martha was in the Center &amp; if she would like to go see it she could.&#160; I told her to just ring the door bell &amp; Martha will let her in.&#160; She walked away &amp; I stayed until all the deathers left Planned Parenthood &amp; then I started to pack up.&#160; Reba was in the hallway of the Center where Martha was sorting out baby clothes in the closet.&#160; We talked a few minutes more &amp; Reba left with a warm good-bye.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;Martha &amp; I stayed in the Center &amp; sorted out baby clothes, by sizes,&#160;until 3:15pm &amp; then went to Confession at St. Anne's Church.&#160; Then we went to Wendy's to get a quick bite before&#160;I went to Mass at 4:30 Downtown.&#160; After Mass I went to Wegmans, in Pittsford.&#160; There in the parking lot, walking to his car&#160;I saw Eric, who works at the Killing Mill Planned Parenthood.&#160; With a stoic look on his face we eyed each other from across 2 rows of cars, to which I hollered "repent Eric".&#160; Small world.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Another Mass to be celebrated by Fr.

They walked over to us &amp; Martha took them to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center to get some clothes &amp; stuffed animals for the little one.&#160; I happened to&#160;have a miniature piano &amp; a pink baby blanket in&#160;my car, which is parked&#160;on the street &amp; I gave them to them. &#160;The mother &amp; little girl were so happy as they followed Martha into the Center for more things.&#160; I went back to my post.&#160; A&#160;young woman who was driving by had taken both hands off the wheel &amp; gave me a&#160;bird from both hands &amp;&#160;her face was growling with anger, she looked like a tortured animal. &#160;I said "God bless you" as she drove by&#160;me.&#160; I do hope that she repents from her possible&#160;abortion &amp; gets forgiveness &amp; healing before she goes insane or kills herself.&#160; Suicide is very high with Post Abortive women.&#160; How sad &amp; the Medical world just ignores the connection between abortion &amp; deep depression thus the woman gets no recognition for her problems.&#160; One woman told me that the abortionist Morris Wortman told her that she had had the problems before her abortion &amp; that the abortion was not related to her depression &amp; frequent crying episodes.&#160; How sick &amp; evil&#160;he is. &#160;I told her different &amp; gave her some helpful Post Abortive phone #'s that she could call &amp; get the help she needed.&#160; As this was happening the mother &amp; daughter had come out of the Center &amp; the little girl was carrying a plastic bag full of goodies.&#160; She was only 4 &amp; she was carrying her merchandise with pride.&#160; The mother tried to take the bag away &amp; the little refused to let go of it.&#160; Spoken as a true shopper.&#160; I told Tucker that ishopping must be in every women's genes.&#160; The shopping gene.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Anthony, our bicycle street friend, rode by &amp;

Bill.&#160; &#160;A young boy, around 12 or 13, rode his bike by us &amp; asked for a packet.&#160; He said that he knew a girl who was thinking about an abortion.&#160; We said that "may God be with you to help this girl not to have her baby killed".&#160; He nodded back to us a thank you.&#160; We will keep this in our prayers.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Martha &amp; I gathered up all the signs &amp; as we were doing this our favorite &amp;

East Room</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;9:01 A.M. EST</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">THE PRESIDENT: Nellie, good to be with you -- we're fellow West Texans who care deeply about the value of human life. Other members of the board of directors for the March for Life, leaders of the pro-life community, and all those who are here with us for the march, it's good to have you here and welcome to the White House. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">As I look out at you, I'll see some folks who have been traveling all night to get here -- (laughter) -- you're slightly bleary-eyed. (Laughter.) I'll see others who are getting ready for a day out in the cold. But mostly I see faces that shine with a love for life. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">I see people with a deep conviction that even the most vulnerable member of the human family is a child of God. You're here because you know that all life deserves to be protected. And as you begin your march, I'm proud to be standing with you. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Thirty-five years ago today the United States Supreme Court declared and decided that under the law an unborn child is not considered a person. But we know many things about the unborn. Biology confirms that from the start each unborn child is a separate individual with his or her own genetic code. Babies can now survive outside the mother's womb at younger and younger ages. And the fingers and toes and beating hearts that we can see on an unborn child's ultrasound come with something that we cannot see: a soul. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Today we're heartened -- we're heartened by the news that the number of abortions is declining. But the most recent data reports that more than one in five pregnancies end in an abortion. America is better than this, so we will continue to work for a culture of life where a woman with an unplanned pregnancy knows there are caring people who will support her; where a pregnant teen can carry her child and complete her education; where the dignity of both the mother and child is honored and cherished.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We aspire to build a society where each one of us is welcomed in life and protected in law. We haven't arrived, but we are making progress. Here in Washington we passed good laws that promote adoption and extend legal protection to children who are born despite abortion attempts. We came together to ban the cruel practice of partial birth abortion. (Applause.) And in the past year we have prevented that landmark law from being rolled back.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We've seen the dramatic breakthroughs in stem cell research that it is possible to advance medical science while respecting the sanctity of life. (Applause.) Building a culture of life requires more than law; it requires changing hearts. And as we reach out to others and find common ground, we can see the glimmerings of a new America on a far shore. This America is rooted in our belief that in a civilized society, the strong protect the weak. This America is nurtured by people like you, who speak up for the weak and the innocent. This America is the destiny of a people whose founding document speaks of the right to life that is a gift of our Creator, not a grant of the state. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">My friends, the time is short and your march is soon. (Laughter.) As you give voice to the voiceless I ask you to take comfort from this: The hearts of the American people are good. (Applause.) Their minds are open to persuasion. And our history shows that a cause rooted in human dignity and appealing to the best instincts of the American people cannot fail. So take heart. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Take heart, be strong, and go forth. May God bless you. (Applause.)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">END 9:10 A.M.

An appointment was made for 5 PM at the FOCUS Pregnancy Help Center for a client to pick up some baby clothes.&#160; I want to thank our friends at the Women's Care Center in providing us the baby clothes for our client.&#160; We ran out of boy clothing but we have lots of girl clothes,&#160; More boys than girls lately.&#160; We put an SOS to our friend Amy, at the Catholic Courier, to see if she could put a blurb in the newspaper to request the general public in giving baby clothes to our Pregnancy Center.&#160; Hope she &amp; others will come through for our clients.&#160; Our client came in and received the baby clothes for her baby who will be born in June.&#160;She was so grateful &amp; I asked her to bring the baby bye&#160;after he is born.&#160; She said"yes".&#160; I said if she need ed anything else please call.&#160; She went home happy and hopefully less stressed. .&#160;Praise God!!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A young girl came out of Planned Parenthood walking pass us &amp;

I offered her a stuffed animal at the Center &amp; she &amp; I walked to it.&#160; She picked out a stuffed brown bear from the basket &amp; I had 3 knitted hats for her &amp; she picked out the dark pink one.&#160;

I said "shame on you".&#160; She told me to "shut up" and then used a word I cannot print here.&#160; I again said "shame on you" and said that we have a first amendment right to speak.&#160; I am sad that that she was so angry that she didn't get the help that she needed &amp; deserved.&#160; I hope&#160;for the sake of her son &amp; herself that she will get the help that she needs.&#160; Today might have been the 'seed planted' which is painful.&#160; I best get a reaction from the girls &amp; guys, though sometimes quite unpleasant, then to have them be Stoic which is more scary.&#160; &#160;At least these people still have a working conscious, which is hopefully in their recovery from the mistakes that they have made.&#160;

When the girls came out they rolled down their window to tell me that there were not in there for an Abortion but for Birth Control.&#160;&#160;I told them that&#160;Birth Control&#160;kills babies early on.&#160;&#160;The girl passenger &#160;said a few choice words to me &amp; they drove off as I was&#160;crying out &#160;to them that they are killing their babies.&#160; They heard the Truth and sometimes people refuse the Truth first, until they are convicted, which I&#160;hope and&#160;pray that they &amp;

So I invited him to go to Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church on Sunday for the Mass @ 10 AM.&#160; He said that he would, I only hope so.&#160; The Blessed Mother is watching over her beloved son Anthony.&#160; I know how he feels over his losses.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">After he left a young woman came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walked over to Martha &amp; I &amp; apologized for being nasty when she had walked by the pro lifers, on the sidewalk earlier.&#160; She said that the pictures bothered her that she had had an abortion in the past &amp; didn't want to feel guilty.&#160; I said that you should for you took the life of another human being but that God does forgives &amp; heals.&#160; I said that if you don't come to the realization of what you did you won't be healed.&#160; Martha told her that she was not alone.&#160; I mentioned Project Rachel (a post abortive ministry for healing the wounds of abortion) to her &amp; handed her a Truth packet &amp; I &#160;told her&#160;that&#160;the brochure&#160;was at the end of all the materials.&#160; I didn't want to lose her but I also needed to tell her the Truth not to take what she did so lightly&#160;but I&#160;also wanted&#160;to&#160;give her Hope&#160;for her future.&#160; I looked sternly but loving&#160;at her &amp; she thanked us &amp; walked away.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that&#160;she will call Project Rachel.&#160; &#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Just after she left&#160;I saw&#160;2 people, a man&#160;and a woman,&#160;walking&#160;on the other side of the sidewalk&#160;across&#160;the street.&#160; As always we usually call out to people to ask them if they would like a prayer Rosary.&#160; Usually they cross the street &amp; come over to us to receive one.&#160; This was no exception.&#160; As they were crossing the street the woman was saying something &amp; as they crossed over she asked us what we were all about.&#160; We told her &amp; they agreed.&#160; We told them that PP targets the Black community &amp; that we had information in our packets regarding this.&#160; He &amp; she agreed that PP was targeting them &amp; were upset.&#160; They took 2 Truth packets to help others in the community.&#160; Then the gentleman stated that his girlfriend, in the past, had his child killed.&#160; His voice was going higher &amp; higher &amp; was getting more upset when speaking about it.&#160; I mentioned that there was a brochure in the packet that talked about men who were affected by an abortion.&#160; He felt helpless, like Anthony earlier on,&#160;in saving the lives of their children.&#160; I hope that he also gets the help &amp; healing that he needs&#160;for this terrible pain&#160;from the effects of an&#160;abortion.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Just as this was happening a lady in a car had stopped to talk with Martha &amp; I.&#160; She said that she had driven by many time but now need to get out of her car to talk to us.&#160; She shared that her daughter had had an abortion in the past &amp; how bad it was for her to have found out.&#160; As appalled as she was of her daughter's abortion she shared that, in her 40'es she thought that she was pregnant &amp; was thinking of having an abortion.&#160; Why do women think that by having their baby killed that it will solve all their problems?&#160; Desperate people do desperate things. We must educate women &amp; girls that abortion is not the answer.&#160; That by having the baby &amp; raising the child or giving the baby up for adoption is when they will be happy.&#160; Abortion will make their lives miserable.&#160; She went on to say that the 10 Commandments were written in all our hearts, even if you don't believe in God.&#160; She said that she was once a Catholic but now was a Mormon &amp; was once a Jehovah Witness.&#160; She took a Truth packet with a Rosary in it, I didn't say anything about the Rosary in the bag,&#160;I'll let the Blessed Mother take over in her coming back into the Catholic faith.&#160; We said that we will pray for her &amp; her family, she was so happy to hear this for she said that one of her daughters was in the hospital &amp; the other daughter, who had had&#160;the abortion, was thinking about going back to her ex-husband, the father of her aborted child. She&#160;then&#160;got back into her car &amp; drove away with a big smile on her face.&#160; There is healing in sharing.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A young man, was waiting in the car on the passenger side, in the parking lot of PP for his girlfriend to come out.&#160; The Death Security Guard Jim went over to talk to him, he was smirking.&#160; How sad you are Jim,&#160; When the girl came out she got into the driver's side &amp; pulled out.&#160; As they were leaving I told her that he was only using her &amp; why didn't he marry her, to which he pulled down his pants to moon us (which is against he law). &#160;They were going the opposite&#160;direction otherwise I would have gotten into my car, which is parked on the street facing Downtown, to get their license plate&#160;#.&#160; We'll just pray for them.&#160; At least we got a reaction, they're not dead yet, there is Hope for them.&#160; The stoic&#160;people are the ones that scare me.&#160; They might be dead already,&#160;

were walking towards me on the sidewalk.&#160; As they passed by I asked them if they would want a packet of information.&#160; The one girl said that they were not there for an abortion but for the Pill.&#160; I went on to say that the Pill kills babies earlier on.&#160; They got mad &amp; said that I was crazy.&#160; As they were walking I said to them&#160; "you are killing your baby early on &amp; that Planned Parenthood doesn't want you to know the Truth".&#160; They just hissed &amp; continued to walk down the street.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that the brief information that they received will resonate in their hearts &amp; minds &amp; that they will do the right thing in the future.&#160; As this was happening another young girl came out of PP &amp; walked towards Martha &amp; I.&#160; Her story was that she had sex for the first time &amp; the condom broke &amp; that PP told&#160;her tocome&#160;back on Friday to get the Morning After Pill.&#160; We talked with her for quite awhile &amp; asked her not to come back here on Friday that if she was pregnant then stay that way until the baby is born.&#160; We gave her some phone #'s that she could get help from if she is pregnant.&#160; She took a Truth packet.&#160; She was kind &amp; open to hear the Truth.&#160; Martha got her phone # &amp; will call her in the next day or so to see how she is doing.&#160; Nice girl &amp; we&#160;only hope &amp; pray that she will not make a lasting mess of her life by choosing death for her baby if she is pregnant.&#160; She said that she's only had sex once &amp; I said that it only takes once to get pregnant.&#160; Secondary virginity, is the only way to stop this chain reaction, of this happening again.&#160; Wait until marriage girls, then you will have nothing to worry about.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Anthony, rode by on his bicycle with a flat tire and asked for a ride to work which we couldn't,t do.&#160; Our new friend said okay &amp; rode away on his flat tire.&#160; He was still wearing, around his neck, the yellow rosary I gave him a week ago, hopefully&#160;the rosary&#160;will give him comfort.&#160;&#160;I&#160;only&#160;hope that he is saying the prayers.&#160; Cleveland, our street friend,&#160;came by &amp; asked for food when all this was going on.&#160; Martha gave him a ham sandwich, which she makes ahead of time.&#160;&#160;He thought the bag of baby blankets I was holding, was more food for him.&#160; He has good days &amp; bad days like us all.&#160;The Blessed Mother is looking out for&#160;them &amp;&#160; all of us too.&#160; It was pretty hectic and the situations still continued to be challenging, as the evening progressed.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A short time later I spotted a young girl talking to a young man, they were standing in our parking lot to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; He left &amp; she walked by us.&#160; I offered her a Truth packet &amp; she said "no" &amp; walked right into Planned Parenthood's parking lot &amp; went to the door &amp; walked in.&#160; I was upset as I always am of anyone going into the Killing Mill.&#160; It wasn't long after that she came out &amp; Martha &amp; I started to talk to her again.&#160; She said that she wasn't there for an abortion but for a pregnancy test, which I told her that we do them at the Pregnancy Center.&#160; I invited her to come with me to have one done.&#160; At this time Tucker had gone home &amp; it was Martha &amp; I out there now.&#160; So Martha had to stay by herself on the sidewalk, which is not&#160;a good&#160; situation to be alone on the sidewalk, though we know that God will protect us.&#160; I was with this young girl for&#160;30 minutes&#160;or more,&#160;in the Center.&#160; She gave herself a pregnancy test &amp; I spoke to her about many things.&#160;She went on to tell me of&#160;her very painful story about her life, which some of it I could relate.&#160;She took a Truth packet &amp; other pamphlets that we have in the Pregnancy Center, that can hopefully help her.&#160; I gave her my home phone #&#160;&amp; other phone #'s that can help her, if she needed it.&#160; Life is precious handle with prayer &amp; doing the right thing. &#160;Martha &amp; I&#160;offered her a ride when we came back outside back on the sidewalk &amp; she said that she would be okay.&#160; When she left I felt so&#160;shell shocked for her story was so intense.&#160;&#160;It was a very fruitful &amp; difficult &amp; evening.&#160; We do it out of love &amp; obedience to Almighty God for all that He does for us.&#160; It is required of us as Christians is to help people.&#160; Remember the Corporate Works of Mercy.&#160; I hold these girls &amp; all the girls &amp; guys in my heart &amp; prayers as also does the other faithful members of this pro-life remnant team.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><strong><font size="3"><hr /></font></strong><p><font size="4" color="#0000ff"><strong>Thursday May 29, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p><p><strong><font size="3">Hardly any cars were at Planned Parenthood this afternoon which is always a good thing but we suspect that they may have changed the abortion day on Thursdays to another day because Martha &amp; her team, through the grace of God, have been so faithful &amp; effective in saving lives.&#160; She &amp; her team&#160;are bad for business, thank God.&#160; So the team will discern another day to go out to save lives, instead of Thursdays. &#160;A couple of girls were talked to by Martha &amp; then they went to the doors of Planned Parenthood &amp; then they&#160;turned away.&#160; As they passed her, on the sidewalk, they said that they didn't need a place that kills kids to go to.&#160; They took a Truth packet &amp; in the packet, along with so many different subjects, we have a list of doctors that don't do abortions nor refer abortions.&#160; It's a short clean list of professional doctors who respect life of that of the woman or girl &amp;

there were 3 pro lifers there already witnessing the Truth.&#160; One was Mark, it was so good to see him.&#160; The other 2 men left &amp; there was Mark &amp; me.&#160; Maria was on the other side of Planned Parenthood witnessing the Truth about Planned Parenthood with her sidewalk of stuffed animals &amp; a table with flowers &amp; pictures of a boy &amp; girl.&#160; Maria later told me that a car had stopped &amp; asked who had been murdered there &amp; she replied that it represented all the babies that Planned Parenthood have murdered, over the years.&#160; They were surprised. &#160;What a witness&#160;to the reality to what Planned Parenthood is doing to ending the lives of American children, for $$$$$$.&#160; As&#160;I was settling in on the sidewalk I looked over to the door of Planned Parenthood &amp; noticed that someone had made, on the left side of the door, a graffiti picture of a whatever?&#160; All I know it was&#160;big&#160;&amp; ugly &amp; red.&#160; Maybe they will pant the whole building red for all the innocent&#160;blood that has been shed there.&#160; This is the first time in&#160;22 years that I have protested Planned Parenthood since 1986, before they started doing abortions in 1993, except the 3 years I lived in Florida, that there has been any graffiti on the Building of Death.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A young girl, with a defiant looking face, walked pass&#160;me on the sidewalk.&#160; As she was walking down the street I asked her if she would&#160;like a Truth packet.&#160; She responded that she was pro choice which I replied that she was really&#160;pro death because in her choice a baby is killed.&#160; I said that if she had had an abortion to repent because she'll be miserable until she does.&#160; I looked away briefly &amp; then turned back towards her again. &#160;I noticed that she was walking in the parking lot of our Center&#160;( there are a couple of business there) so I started to walk over to see where she was going.&#160; I won't discuss this any further only to protect the identity of her&#160;parents, who I know.&#160; I'll pray for her &amp; her family to which maybe they are unaware of her stand.&#160; I'm sure that they are also praying for her too.&#160; She is not a happy young girl.&#160; &#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Then there was a confrontation between me &amp; a woman who had dropped off a young girl at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was concerned about the 2 children in the back seat of the car.&#160; I asked if they were in car seats or seat belts &amp; she got real mad at me.&#160;We went back &amp; forth&#160; until I realized that it was no use in getting through to her &amp; I needed to calm down too.&#160;She said that they were older kids &amp; I realized that the children were older &amp; they didn't need a car seat.&#160; She was walking to the door without them &amp; I said that you can't leave them alone in the car.&#160; She used a 4 letter word &amp; I said not to talk like that in front of the kids.&#160; She hollered that I was nuts to the&#160;death security guard Jim.&#160; Little did she know that he was the nutty one.&#160; She left&#160; with the kids in the car with the girl still in PP.&#160; Martha&#160;had now come onto the sidewalk.&#160;&#160;About 15 minutes later&#160;the lady&#160;came back to pick up the young girl she had dropped off earlier.&#160;&#160;We decided that we were not going to speak to her again so as not to agitate her. After a little while the young girl came out.&#160; At this time Mark &amp; Maria &#160;had to go, so it was Martha &amp; I now.&#160; As she was pulling out of the driveway I said to her that we loved her &amp; cared.&#160; She stopped the car in the street.&#160; I went over &amp; said that so many people don't care about their children &amp; that bothers me. &#160;I apologized for over reacting.&#160; She said that she was not one of them.&#160;I offered her a Truth packet &amp; she took it. &#160;She then said that her daughter was pregnant &amp; that they are keeping the baby.&#160; I told her that we had&#160;baby clothes in our Pregnancy Center next door &amp; if she wanted anything just dive over to the parking lot next door.&#160; She said "okay".&#160;Praise God who would figure this scenario would end this way.&#160; Thank you Jesus.&#160; It was by the grace of God that we both calmed down &amp; could talk with each other respectfully. &#160;Martha went over to the Center to give her some baby clothes &amp; I stayed alone on the sidewalk to witness &amp; counsel.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;As I was alone, a young girl walked over to me from across the street.&#160; She said that she has walked by before but was always in a hurry &amp; couldn't stop.&#160; Today she wasn't in a hurry so decided to cross over to look at the pictures.&#160; She was a sensible young lady who expressed that you get married then have sex.&#160; I nearly dropped over. WOW I said.&#160; You have made my day &amp; then some.&#160; She said that she goes to Edison &amp; the nurse said for her to go on the Pill because pregnancy is&#160;high among the Black girls.&#160; She found this statement to be Racist &amp; further more she is NOT sexually active.&#160; I told her that Planned Parenthood &amp; their poison are in the schools corrupting the young girls &amp; guys.&#160; She took a Truth packets &amp; I told her that there was so much info in it.&#160; She also said that she had to do a Community Project, for school &amp; that she would like to do hers here on the sidewalk.&#160; I gave her my phone # for her to contact me when that time comes.&#160; I mentioned that Martha was in the Center &amp; if she would like to go see it she could.&#160; I told her to just ring the door bell &amp; Martha will let her in.&#160; She walked away &amp; I stayed until all the deathers left Planned Parenthood &amp; then I started to pack up.&#160; Reba was in the hallway of the Center where Martha was sorting out baby clothes in the closet.&#160; We talked a few minutes more &amp; Reba left with a warm good-bye.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;Martha &amp; I stayed in the Center &amp; sorted out baby clothes, by sizes,&#160;until 3:15pm &amp; then went to Confession at St. Anne's Church.&#160; Then we went to Wendy's to get a quick bite before&#160;I went to Mass at 4:30 Downtown.&#160; After Mass I went to Wegmans, in Pittsford.&#160; There in the parking lot, walking to his car&#160;I saw Eric, who works at the Killing Mill Planned Parenthood.&#160; With a stoic look on his face we eyed each other from across 2 rows of cars, to which I hollered "repent Eric".&#160; Small world.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Another Mass to be celebrated by Fr. John Reif, from Holy Cross, is being scheduled at the Focus Pregnancy Help Center, towards the end of June.&#160; We are blessed.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="4">&#160;<font color="#0000ff"><strong>Wednesday, June 5, 2008 in front of the&#160;Planned Parenthood</strong></font></font></p><p><strong><font size="3">I got out of my car &amp; went to my post, on the sidewalk, by the tree.&#160; I noticed that someone was on the passenger side in the parked car in front of the building by the sidewalk.&#160; Tucker &amp; I were there &amp; he was setting up the signs.&#160; I called over &amp; asked the girl who was in the car with the windows down if she would like some info.&#160; She quickly rolled up the window.&#160; I said to Tucker as I walked by him that she didn't want the Truth &amp; helped him set up.&#160; A few minutes later I was back standing by the tree &amp; the young girl who rolled up her window got out of the car &amp; walked over to me.&#160; She got to me &amp; asked to have a packet, the one I was talking about.&#160; I gave it to her &amp; said "God Bless you"&#160;&#160;&amp; she went back into the car. About 20 minutes the young girl &amp; another girl who was in the car got out &amp; went into PP.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;After that Martha came &amp; I gave her the mega phone &amp; I witnessed to the people driving by with the graphic sign of aborted Malachi.&#160; As we were witnessing a young girl came out with her young child, a cute little girl &amp; I called over &amp; asked her if she wanted any baby clothes for her daughter.&#160; They walked over to us &amp; Martha took them to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center to get some clothes &amp; stuffed animals for the little one.&#160; I happened to&#160;have a miniature piano &amp; a pink baby blanket in&#160;my car, which is parked&#160;on the street &amp; I gave them to them. &#160;The mother &amp; little girl were so happy as they followed Martha into the Center for more things.&#160; I went back to my post.&#160; A&#160;young woman who was driving by had taken both hands off the wheel &amp; gave me a&#160;bird from both hands &amp;&#160;her face was growling with anger, she looked like a tortured animal. &#160;I said "God bless you" as she drove by&#160;me.&#160; I do hope that she repents from her possible&#160;abortion &amp; gets forgiveness &amp; healing before she goes insane or kills herself.&#160; Suicide is very high with Post Abortive women.&#160; How sad &amp; the Medical world just ignores the connection between abortion &amp; deep depression thus the woman gets no recognition for her problems.&#160; One woman told me that the abortionist Morris Wortman told her that she had had the problems before her abortion &amp; that the abortion was not related to her depression &amp; frequent crying episodes.&#160; How sick &amp; evil&#160;he is. &#160;I told her different &amp; gave her some helpful Post Abortive phone #'s that she could call &amp; get the help she needed.&#160; As this was happening the mother &amp; daughter had come out of the Center &amp; the little girl was carrying a plastic bag full of goodies.&#160; She was only 4 &amp; she was carrying her merchandise with pride.&#160; The mother tried to take the bag away &amp; the little refused to let go of it.&#160; Spoken as a true shopper.&#160; I told Tucker that ishopping must be in every women's genes.&#160; The shopping gene.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Anthony, our bicycle street friend, rode by &amp; said hello but he was on his way to wok (Thank God) &amp; couldn't stop.&#160; Jerry, one of the pro lifers stopped by to say hi to us &amp; that he will try to be there tomorrow, in front of Planned Parenthood praying along with Martha &amp; Bill.&#160; &#160;A young boy, around 12 or 13, rode his bike by us &amp; asked for a packet.&#160; He said that he knew a girl who was thinking about an abortion.&#160; We said that "may God be with you to help this girl not to have her baby killed".&#160; He nodded back to us a thank you.&#160; We will keep this in our prayers.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Martha &amp; I gathered up all the signs &amp; as we were doing this our favorite &amp; encouraging woman drove by, Sonia &amp; hollered out of&#160;the car window "thank you" to which I replied "your welcome".&#160; Thank you God for Sonia, truly a breath of fresh air.&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Martha &amp; I&#160;went into the Center to eat &amp; make up 20 more Truth packet for the&#160;innocent victims of Planned Parenthood to devour.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><font size="3"><font color="#0000ff">Thursday, June 5, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Martha &amp;
