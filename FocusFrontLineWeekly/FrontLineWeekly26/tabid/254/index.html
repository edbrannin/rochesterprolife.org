I stated that that second door must be closed &amp; locked when children are here. &#160;Also, to make sure there is no child behind you if you're going to the basement because Martha said that there was a young child behind her when she was going to the basement today. &#160;Glad that she saw him. &#160;Scary!!</span>&#160;</span></span></div></strong></div><p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)">T</span><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34); background-color: rgb(255,255,255)">his evening was our <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0)">first Mass in our 'new' Focus.</span>&#160; It's always stressful getting ready for Mass but Mike G. had put so many things away before he left yesterday I felt comfortable.

I went over &amp; greeted him with a big smile on my face &amp; briefly told him all the tales of woe that were happening. &#160;He said "offer them up". &#160;Okay Father! &#160;He celebrated a beautiful Mass &amp; gave a profound homily, I was touched by the words. After Mass he blessed the water &amp; salt &amp; then sprinkled the Holy Water in very room, even the basement, to ward off the evil one. He then gave the people, the Sacrament of the Sick, a healing Sacrament. &#160;He laid his hands on our head &amp; prayed then anointed our forehead &amp; hands with Blessed Oil. &#160;It was so holy. &#160;I was so appreciative of his priestly powers. &#160;After that we all ate a delicious meal of Salvatore pizza, chicken wings, green salad &amp; Martha's homemade rice &amp; sausage casserole.....delicious! There were deserts too. &#160;Fr. Mickey enjoyed himself &amp; we were so happy that he came tonight.

I said that I felt persecuted &amp; he replied that that was a strong word &amp; I said " know it". &#160;I also said that would the city want 200 people in front of their building (I knew I could get more) &amp; maybe it's time to meet the Mayor &amp; I have two Pro Bruno attorneys to help us. &#160;He was looking dazzled. &#160;I asked if he could meet our landlord for he was coming soon. &#160;He said that he had another appointment as he was looking at his laptop. &#160;So sad. &#160;He then got up &amp; went to his rented car in front of the building. &#160;I quickly called the landlord Remy &amp; asked him to hurry over, for the City Official, was here. &#160;I knew that he was driving. &#160;James came in from the cold. &#160;He spoke to Martha &amp; I a few more minutes saying "why did you move down here....the neighbors here are so difficult (no kidding James). &#160;He also said that he's been her in this area for 4 months (I guess he never saw our A-Frame sign down the street)?? &#160;So many problems!!! &#160;As he was leaving hurrah Remy comes up the three stairs as a bat out of hell. &#160;He sat down on the chair sating that he had just come form City Hall &amp; had spoken to the Historic Official &amp; everything was fine!!!! &#160;He then said "you people living in the city think that is is the burbs...it will always be the city.!!! &#160;James looked at his computer &amp; stated that all has been cancelled &amp; for us to have a nice day...He left quickly.

I quickly asked him if he would go to my car &amp; get the things out of the back seat. I gave him my car keys &amp; off he went. I noticed that he was bringing bags from my trunk. I said “not the truck, the back seat of my car”. After he got all that was in the back seat he brought the other bags back to the trunk. I was happy, then, but not later on. I wanted to leave a little bit earlier tonight because of the elections but when I went to get my keys, where I always put them, they weren't there. I started to panic because I didn't remember that our helper gave them back to me. He didn't. Martha lookedat our Sign in Sheets, to get his mother's phone number, &amp; called her. She said that she will call her son to tell him that we need the keys back. About 15 minutes later he was at our front door. I was thrilled but when he came in he said that he didn't have the keys. I said “what”!! &#160;He then said that he had put them on the table here but there were no keys on it. I called the mom with the three children to ask her if she had taken the keys by mistake &amp; she said that she didn't. “Okay &amp; thanks” I said back to her. I was dismayed but determined to find them. I prayed to God, Mother Mary &amp; St. Anthony, the Patron Saint of loss items, so I felt at peace for they knew where they were. The the young man said “maybe I dropped them on the sidewalk gong home”. I thought that if someone finds them what would they do with many keys on a chain. He walked down the street &amp; then came back saying that he didn't find them. "Okay" I said. &#160;We all looked over Focus for two hours. &#160;I then said to Martha "why don't you go home". She said "no, I think they might be in the trunk". &#160;I told her that I didn't have the key to get into the trunk to see. &#160;She said "your back seat probably comes down". I said that my car is old &amp; it probably doesn't.......but thank God it did come down &amp; Martha found my bunch of keys in there!!!! &#160; I was sooooo happy &amp; went home to watch the elections at 9:15 pm. &#160;Great election results!!</strong></span></span></p><p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; margin-bottom: 0in; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><u><em>What a day!!!&#160;</em></u></span></strong></span></span></p></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZAyTiu-XdTRQEXqOBJ7HDLYbIe1Pz8HgPhot6mHRf1530y1cEG45YKfU3wih7C20dQmmOa5EH1HPFQ_o-B_G9N-JQch6LdfMmckqCk6736Q2UglABE1xf3ql6TqsehZySQMMkTjbJ3jV3oBCQGNnMGqAjDxEgZW4__MtkVfSRn3cjYCu=s0-d-e1-ft#http://email.vervemail.com/cimages/01c4d5a035de0f387d0a0b2cc0242f46/CV-2014-Election-VICTORY-Email-580x330.jpg" alt="Displaying " /></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;<strong style="font-size: large;">‘It All Matters’</strong></span></span></span></p><div align="center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></span></div><div align="center">&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div align="center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>If there is one message to share  with young Christians, it’s this: It all matters.

It was 1920 that  my grandmother had an abortion &amp; we lost a child, in the&#160;family, &amp; in  the world.&#160;&#160; It was a second trimester abortion at Johns Hopkins Hospital, not a  back alley.&#160;&#160;My Aunt was named Mary Elizabeth.&#160; Two &amp; a half years later,  now&#160;pregnant with my mother, my grandmother was going to have another  abortion&#160;again but my great grandmother stopped her this time.&#160; My mother Anna  May was born with the cord around her neck.&#160;&#160;I am her daughter.&#160; Abortions takes  lives of people......&#160; I suffer with the loss of my Aunt &amp; I hopefully will  see her someday.....I wonder if my grandmother is with her now, I don’t know.&#160;  We know that the babies go to Heaven but the mothers &amp; all who were apart of  this murder we don’t know.&#160; Hopefully they will confess their sin against  God&#160;before they die, because once you’re dead it’s to late.&#160;&#160; There is a Hell. &#160;&#160;</strong></span></span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br type="_moz" /></strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Another young woman came, into the  center, for a pregnancy center.&#160;
