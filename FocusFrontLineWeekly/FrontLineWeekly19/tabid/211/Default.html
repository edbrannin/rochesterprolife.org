asked her if it would be all right &amp; she said "yes", so Sue  went into the Rose Room along with Martha.&#160; The test was negative so Martha did  some teaching with her.&#160; Later on another woman came in with her Social Worker  to get a pregnancy test &amp;

 couldn't see very well. Oh no! She said that she couldn't go to Bill Smith's  wake today &amp; I said that I'll see if I go tonight.&#160; Martha &amp; I got to  Focus after Mass today &amp; started our work. We had a quick lunch when the  doorbell rang. Martha got up to answer it &amp; then came back to the table to  finish her lunch. The doorbell rang again &amp; it was another client to get  what she needed. I went into the office to see if I could get anything on the  Internet about the vote for the new Pope. I prayed &amp; I finally found Youtube  Vatican &amp; saw the chimney sitting on the roof. I called Martha into the  office &amp; we sat &amp; watched it for awhile. The doorbell rang again &amp;  Martha went to the door to open it &amp; it was Sandy, our irregular volunteer,  for she comes when she can. She said it was her Birthday today &amp; she was 50!  We wished her a Happy Birthday &amp; sat back down in front of the computer to  keep on watching the screen with the non smoking chimney. Then the doorbell rang  &amp; Sandy answered it three times. Lynda, our volunteer, came in &amp; watched  the screen with Martha &amp; I. All of a sudden the black smoke came through but  the people were cheering then all of a sudden the smoke became white like wool  the bells were ringing. Yeah! we all screamed, we have a new Pope. We waited for  an hour before we knew who he was. Then Sandy came into the office to say "one  of the girls is here for a pregnancy test". We all looked at each other &amp;  Martha said "I'm staying right here". "Okay" I said back, "I'll do it". Lynda  then said "I'll start the paper work for you”. I said "okay &amp; thanks" &amp;  continued to watch the computer to finally see our new Pope come out onto the  balcony. He was all in white &amp; just stood there quietly then spoke. At that  time I got up to complete the pregnancy test. I greeted the young lady &amp;  then brought her into the Rose Room for the pregnancy test. The first thing that  she said to me was "this place doesn't believe in abortions"? I said "Your  right, we don't believe in abortions, for it's the taking of a life of an  innocent baby". Then I looked on her Intake Sheet to see that she had had two  abortions &amp; had one child &amp; was 18 years old. She did the test &amp; as  we were waiting I gave her all the post abortion literature that we had &amp;  our Growth &amp; Development DVD. </span></strong></span></p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Her test was negative we both were very happy. I  didn't want anymore children to be killed if she was thinking about abortion  again. I spoke to her about abstinence too &amp; asked her if she knew the Lord  &amp; if she did for her to ask him to forgive her for taking two lives. She  said that she did already. I said then “no sex before marriage, wait for the  right man to be your husband”. I then said “good bye &amp; God bless you” &amp;  she replied “God bless you too”. I felt badly for her. I then started to walk  back into the office when Sandy said that another woman wanted a pregnancy test.  I then went back to the Rose Room to clean it up &amp; then went to the Green  Room to greet our other client. She said to me “you remember me”? I said “yes I  do”. She is a nice lady that came with her friend last year. She said that her  friend is pregnant now. She had her daughter with her who had lots of energy  &amp; they were now both in the Rose Room after she had filled out the Intake  Sheet &amp; got a urine specimen for the test. Her daughter who is 4 years old  took about 6 suckers that we have in the bowl on the table &amp; I asked her to  put some of them back. Her mother took them out of her hands to return them to  their rightful place. She did the test &amp; we waited for about 4 minutes &amp;  I looked at it to see that it appeared with only one line so I said that she  wasn't pregnant. Lynda took the daughter to amuse her &amp; I locked the door  because when I looked at the test again I saw that another line was peaking  through. I asked her to do another test &amp; she did &amp; the same thing  happened again. She is a mother of 7 children &amp; she was happy with baby  number 8. Praise God!! What a difference in these two women. My heart was happy  &amp; sad. I cleaned up the room &amp; went back into the office to see what was  on the screen when the doorbell rang again &amp; it was the two Elim students to  help us out today.

Paul went to get something to eat &amp; I knew that Dr. Karen was coming soon. After Sheila left it was just Mike &amp; I in the spiritual battle for lives &amp; souls. A car with two older men drove into the parking lot but came out about 5 minutes later. The passenger made a very rude comment about my sign &amp; I said "shame on you". He said something to Mike &amp; he spoke back to him. I don't know what he had said to the passenger who was a very sick man. He also gave us his finger, how sad was that. What he saw out there, on the front lines, must have made him feel very uneasy. It was a very windy day so really all we had was the sign that I was holding as the wind was trying to blow it away. I had to hold it against the tree &amp; my body, with the sign in the middle.

Edison came in at 5:40pm &amp; I greeted him &amp; showed him where to go to set  up for the Mass.&#160; It was now 6pm &amp; Father wanted to start the Mass.&#160; It was  so beautiful.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; it was our young lady with her  boyfriend to give her testimony about her pregnancy.&#160; After Mass Father gave  those who wanted the Sacrament of the Sick.&#160; I then introduced to the 33 people,  after thanking Father for a wonderful Mass, our young couple.&#160; Infidelity gave  the most poignant testimony that I have heard &amp; all our hearts were touched  by her bravery, through the grace of God.&#160; She was 14 &amp; her boyfriend was 16  when she got&#160;pregnant &amp; her mother &amp; the boyfriend wanted her to have an  abortion.&#160; The mother drove her into Planned Parenthood when she saw &amp; heard  us out on the front lines telling her the Truth.&#160; She told her mother that she  didn't want to have the abortion &amp; made a fuss &amp; the mother wasn't  happy.&#160; They left the inside of Planned Parenthood &amp; got into the car &amp;  when the car stopped on the way out she jumped out of the car &amp; fled.&#160; She  said that she went to her grandmothers house until she was further along so that  her mother wouldn't drive her back to Planned Parenthood or anywhere else to  have an abortion.&#160; Her baby was a month early &amp; is now 2 years old.&#160; The  boyfriend in now supportive &amp; they she is waiting until marriage to have sex  again.&#160; She is a Christian &amp; is obeying God's laws the 10 Commandments.&#160;  Good for you dear Infinity &amp; boyfriend.&#160; When we all went into the Green  Room to eat Fr. Edison spent much time in speaking with this fine couple.&#160; We  all had a great time eating good food &amp; talking.&#160; I went into the office to  get Father's Thank You card &amp; I handed it to him with a verbal thank you for  coming &amp; celebrating the Mass &amp; blessing all our rooms at Focus &amp;  for giving us the Sacrament of the Sick too.&#160; He looked at me &amp; smiled.&#160; I  then went back into the office when I heard a voice from behind me saying "no  Mary I cannot accept this, you keep it for Focus".&#160; It was a small monetary  donation that I had put in the thank you card, he didn't want it so thank you  again Fr. Edison for everything.&#160; Then he said "how many Masses do you have at  Focus yearly"?&#160; I answered back "about 4 to 6 Masses each year".&#160; He said "I  think that you should have a Mass at Focus every month in the good weather  months &amp; I can ask a couple of Priests friends of mine if they will  celebrate a Mass here".&#160; Then he said : I want to do another Mass in May &amp;  I'll email you the day &amp; time because I'll be leaving to go away for a  couple of weeks in May".&#160; I said "okay Father I'll wait for your email".&#160; I  thanked him again &amp; then he was out the door.&#160; When I got home about two  hours later it was on my email that he wanted to come back on Thursday, May 9th.  at 6pm.&#160; Okay Father Edison I will work on a flier &amp; sent it out to the many  people on my email list.&#160; Hurrah!!!&#160; What a great  day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></div></span></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><br /></span></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" id="TitleLabel">We Are God's Agents</span></span><font size="2"><font size="3"> <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 16px;" id="SPAN2"><span style="font-size: 16px;" id="TextLabel">Faith, salvation, the conversion of the world, the accomplishing of  God's plan is brought about by God, not by us—except as instruments of his  saving power.</span></span></font></font></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"></font></font></font></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br /></font></div><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;</div><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;</div><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thursday, April 11, 2013 on the Front  Lines</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I knew that there was a water leak in the office  yesterday, so I put down some pans over two plastic bags, to  catch the water.&#160; I spoke with the newest landlord&#160;Dan &amp; he said that once  the weather was better they were sending a company up there to fix it  permanently.&#160; "Okay" I said "I can't wait, for we've been having this problem  for many years &amp;&#160;we're&#160;tired of it".&#160; I was nice but firm.&#160; He feels the  same way we do at Focus about the ceiling leaking so much. I do trust that he  will get it fixed correctly.&#160; So after Mass this morning I went to the bank to  drop off the donations of fine people that have blessed us &amp; went right to  Focus.&#160; When I got in there was nobody there so I opened up all the rooms to get  ready.&#160; It was to early for me to go out to the front lines so I decided to eat  lunch of the left overs that were in the refrig.&#160; I was eating when the doorbell  rang &amp; I got up to answer it, it was our client-friend Valerie coming in to  help out.&#160; She saw that I was eating so she said that she was going out to the  sidewalk to be with the people out there.&#160; I said "thanks &amp; I'll see you  later".&#160; I then continued to eat when the doorbell rang once more.&#160; There was a  young girl at the door asking for a pregnancy test.&#160; I let her in &amp; greeted  her &amp; then lead her to the Rose Room for the test.&#160; She filled out the  Intake Sheet &amp; then she did the test.&#160; It was negative.&#160; I saw from the  Intake Sheet that she had had an abortion so I spoke to her about that &amp;  I&#160;gave her lots of informational brochures for her to take with&#160;her.&#160; She said  that she would never do it again &amp; that she had asked God to forgive her,  she was young &amp; foolish.&#160; She said that she was planning on marrying&#160;her new  boyfriend soon. &#160;I&#160;then called Embracing Options Pregnancy Center &amp; spoke  with Dee about their Post Abortion Ministry.&#160; She said that they were starting a  Bible Healing Class, in the Fall, so I gave the phone to our client &amp; she  gave Dee the information that&#160;she requested &amp; she will call her in the  Fall&#160;before it starts.&#160; How wonderful was this!&#160; Then as I was leading her into  the Material Aid Room ,to get some clothes for herself,&#160;she asked me a question,  so I said for her to wait in the Rose Room&#160;until Dr. Karen comes &amp; I'll sent  her in, to speak with her.&#160; Karen came about 10 minutes later &amp; I spoke with  her for a minute &amp; then she went into the Rose Room to speak to our client.&#160;  They spent at least 12 minutes in there talking &amp; then&#160;the young lady&#160;went  in to the Material Aid Room where Valerie was now in there &amp; they befriended  each other.&#160; It was wonderful to witness this&#160;between these two strangers.&#160;Sort  of like an immediate sisterhood&#160;forming.&#160; </span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">I was so happy&#160;when Dr.&#160; Karen, who does the  ultrasounds for us &amp; all the pregnancy centers, told me that all of our clients, at Focus, made their appointment for  an ultrasound on Wednesday&#160;&amp; all were&#160;very happy when they saw their  precious baby, even the young lady, that Martha got away from Palnned Parenthood  two weeks ago, who wanted an abortion.&#160; Yeah! for this is great news!!&#160;</span></div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">I had heard Martha coming into the center while I  was in the Rose Room so I knew that she was now out on the Front Lines.&#160; I went  out about 2pm to join her &amp; the others.&#160; When I got out to the sidewalk  there was Martha &amp; Jim was leaving &amp; across the street was Adolf &amp;  Ron standing holding non graphic signs &amp; praying the Rosary.&#160; As I came  outside Martha then went inside which was fine.&#160; She came back out around 3pm  &amp; I stayed with her for a short time witnessing to people on the street  &amp; in the parking lot of the Killing Mill.&#160; A car came out of Planned  Parenthood with a young girl sitting in the passenger side giving me her #1  sign.&#160; How sad it that :(&#160; I went back into the center to do something around  3:15pm.&#160; I saw that Suzanne was now there &amp; Karen had left.&#160; Paul &amp;  Valerie were still working hard.&#160; I then received a phone call from Sharleen who  was giving us the $1,000 worth of 'free' food from the Mormons.&#160; I told her that  I didn't have anyone to pick up the food boxes on Friday or Saturday &amp; she  said that she &amp; her husband Jeff would pick me up at my apartment tomorrow  at 9:30am&#160; &amp; take me to the Storehouse in Canandaigua to pick it up &amp; t  bring it to Focus!&#160; Wow!!&#160; This was a prayer answered.&#160; Bill &amp; Lynda offered  but their car was to small &amp; it was so far away for them too, I thought.&#160;  This was great news.&#160; I then spoke with Suzanne for a short time &amp; then  Martha opened up the front door &amp; said to me with a loud voice "Mary come  out right now, for a car almost ran over the two guys, who are on the other side  of the street".&#160; I got what I needed &amp; left immediately to go back to the  front lines.&#160; She said that Ron called the police &amp; that she got the license  number of the car.&#160; Great!&#160; We were now waiting for the police to come.&#160; And we  waited &amp; waited &amp; waited some more.&#160; Martha called back 911 &amp; gave  another street address for the police &amp; we waited &amp; waited &amp; waited  some more.&#160; The two men had to leave, for it was now 4pm, &amp; Ron had to pick  up his daughter from school.&#160; Martha went into the center &amp; called&#160;911&#160;  again &amp; when I came into the center around 4:45pm she said that an officer  was coming to Focus.&#160; Okay I thought &amp; what happened!!&#160; We were&#160;doing things  now in Focus when the doorbell ran &amp; it wa Officer Mike Fay.&#160; We know him  &amp; he knows us.&#160; He said that he was on his way after he received the call  but then another call came in which was a homicide&#160; &amp; he had to take that  call first.&#160; We said "okay &amp; we're glad that you're hear now".&#160; Martha told  him everything so he&#160;wanted to go outside to get a better description of the  event.&#160; When they came back into Focus, Martha told me that the abortionist,  Rachel Phelps, was driving out when they were standing on the sidewalk &amp;  she&#160;saw them both.&#160; She murdered so many little babies here today, how evil is  that!!!!&#160; Officer Mike said that the two men, when they come back next Thursday,  needed to call again 911 to get a police report completed.&#160; He said that he will  check out the license number &amp; do a check but he really couldn't do anything  else until they call next week.&#160; I don't think that they will call 91 next  Thursday, for Ron said that&#160;they were all right.&#160; I said back to him "you might  be all right now but the next time you might not be"!&#160; They also need to  protect, all of us as, few as we are out there, by reporting this crime.&#160; I hope  that they will change their&#160;minds.&#160; &#160;What a day!!!!!!&#160; Sometimes you just want to cry<font size="2">.</font><br /></span></div></span></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tuesday, April 16, 2013 at Focus</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a pleasant afternoon today.&#160; There was a lot  of help &amp; a lot got done.&#160; Yesterday Ni saw a lot of clients but she  couldn't get the first Material Aid Room open because the key didn't work, that  we have hidden in the center.&#160; She had to wait until Rob, our sidewalk counselor  on Mondays on the front line,&#160;came to open up the room.&#160; Later on tonight, I  went &amp; got another key made for the room, &amp; I hope that it works.&#160; She's  a trooper but I don't want that to happen again.&#160; Martha &amp; I went to Albany  on a bus with 52 other people to talk to the Legislators about Cuomo's third  trimester abortion bill.&#160; There was about 300 people that we joined to pray  &amp; to talk &amp; to peacefully protest.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that some hearts  were changed today.&#160; Martha &amp; I were standing on the sidewalk protesting, in  Albany,&#160;with our non graphic signs &amp;&#160;a young woman,&#160;said something that  wasn't very nice, it was even really bad,&#160;as she drove passed us.&#160; Poor young  girl, I hope that you repent.&#160; Otherwise the people were nice there.&#160; &#160;I got  home at 11:30 pm for we were gone for 12 hours.&#160; When I got back I looked at the  TV to see more about the bombings at the Boston Marathon, it was horrible &amp;  so very sad.&#160; It was evil.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When Martha &amp; I got to the center we saw that  Valerie, our client friend, was coming around the corner from the Buckpitt  building.&#160; She had been standing with a sign, on the sidewalk, in front of  Planned Parenthood, for an hour &amp; she said that she was cold &amp; tired.&#160;  After lunch she took a nap with her head down on the table.&#160; Pleasant dreams  dear lady :)&#160; Please take care of yourself Valerie.&#160; Then I was just about to  call Sue to see if she was okay when the doorbell rang &amp; in she came.&#160; She  said that she was sick last week with a stomach bug &amp; it wasn't any fun  either.&#160; I get your drift Sue &amp; we're happy to see you alive &amp; well.&#160;  She said that she lost 6lbs. but gained it back, I would never have guessed for  she looks great.&#160; She also mentioned that her son was Confirmed yesterday, at  the Sacred Heart Cathedral, &amp; she was very happy :) </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul came in to work &amp;

while she was gone a young lady came in for a pregnancy test.&#160;  It was negative &amp; I spent some time talking with her &amp; giving her lots  of brochures.&#160; She said that she likes to read.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I also suggested that  she come back next week for a repeat test if she needs to, for it might have  been to early today, we'll see.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tim came in to see what we needed &amp;

I&#160;was so happy to see her too.&#160; Our clients were so nice &amp; we  were so happy to help them.&#160; Today we had the two brothers get what they needed  for their families.&#160; I usually thank&#160;the one brother, who comes more  frequently,&#160;for being a good father to his children &amp; encouraged him to get  married.&#160; Lets hope so.&#160; He wants to but she doesn't, go figure.&#160; She just had  another precious baby who was born 4lbs. &amp; she's now 6lbs..&#160; She's growing  up.&#160; We had a pregnant mom come in with two of her three children.&#160; Her 2 year  son was tired &amp; 'no' was his favorite word.&#160; He didn't even finish his  lollipop, that's tired :(&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone was gone so Martha &amp; I ate a nice  super when I received a call asking to speak to Mary.&#160; I said that I was Mary  &amp; who was I speaking with.&#160; He said that he had a Summons&#160;for me  to&#160;testify,&#160;&amp; he name the names, for they were suing the City of Rochester.&#160;  I said that I didn't even know these people &amp;  never saw anything to testify against.&#160; He said that he would leave the papers  by my front door.&#160; "Okay" I finally said back to him before I said"goodbye"  &amp; hung up.&#160; Martha &amp; I were trying to figure this one out, when I  remembered the lady at Buckpitt who had fallen down,&#160;on the icy sidewalk in  front of the business where she worked, about 3 years ago.&#160; Martha I &amp; were  out on the front lines when we heard her cry out &amp; we went over to help  her.&#160;&#160;She did&#160;go to the hospital &amp; was hurt &amp; she's now suing.&#160; On the  way home&#160;I received a phone call so I stopped my car by the main library to  answer it &amp; it was Martha, who was now home, telling me that she  also&#160;received a Summons to appear in court on May 23rd. at 10am.&#160; At least I'll  have the Lord &amp; Martha with me on that day if they don't settle before hand,  which we hope that they do.&#160;

I were busy today along with Paul  &amp; Lyndia helping us but first we celebrated Paul's Birthday with an homemade  chocolate coconut cake, that Martha made,&#160;it was delicious.&#160; We gave him a card  a some chocolate candy &amp; Wendy's coupons, he was so happy.&#160; It was so nice  &amp; I think that we sang Happy Birthday to him about four times.&#160; Sandy came  in to celebrate with us too.&#160; The Life Insurance man came in to give Paul &amp;  I are documents.&#160; He is very nice.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We saw a lot of clients today which was very  good.&#160;Martha did a pregnancy test &amp; it&#160;was negative &amp; when the client  was leaving&#160;Martha noticed that she had the bathroom spray in her purse so she  told her to leave that behind when you leave.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; gave it  back to Martha. I was not happy when I heard this, for some of our clients think  that they can take anything that's not nailed down, how bizarre is  that.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;Lyndia went outside in front of Planned Parenthood  &amp; brought into the center a woman who along with her husband &amp; 4 year  old daughter who had come out of the mill.&#160; She said that they mixed up her  records &amp; told her that she had a sexual transmitted disease &amp; then  laughed.&#160; I told her that they were evil &amp; not to go there for anything  &amp; to tell her friends that too.&#160; Martha did another pregnancy test &amp;  Lyndia played with the little girl.&#160; They had fun.&#160; The pregnancy test was  negative so I said for her to go to her doctors office for&#160;a blood pregnancy  test because she thinks that she is pregnant.&#160; I then mentioned that if the test  is positive then call me &amp; I'll schedule a free ultrasound test, she agreed  &amp; they all went home.&#160; It was so good that Lyndia went out to the front  lines this afternoon.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">I was busy in the office &amp;

the  bank.&#160; Paul was in the Green Room working on a ceiling project for us, in the  hallway.&#160; He's such a hard worker.&#160; I knew that Dr. Karen wasn't going to be  with us today but I thought that Suzanne will be with us for it's her Birthday  &amp; we had cake!!&#160; Later on she called me to tell me that she had a real bad  cold &amp; her head was pounding.&#160; She was sad that she couldn't be with us all  on her Birthday but we'll celebrate next Thursday along with Dr. Karen.&#160; I was  still tired from yesterday for I have much stress but this is a killing day so I  needed to be here for the babies &amp; their mothers, to try to save both.&#160; I  was hoping that Martha would be there at 1pm but she wasn't, she came a little  later &amp; I must get used to that, for she does so much good at Focus &amp; on  the sidewalk.&#160; I ate quickly &amp; did a few things before I went out to the  sidewalk.&#160; I met with Sheila &amp; Tom &amp; greeted them.&#160; After Sheila left  Tom stayed with me until Martha arrived around 1:30pm to pray &amp; to counsel.&#160;  I am always so upset when I'm out on the front lines &amp; some people don't  understand that "if you're not angry about abortion then what could you be angry  about".&#160; Come Holy Spirit come!!&#160; At 2:20pm Adolf came without Ron for he's  looking for work.&#160; I asked him f he would call the police to make out a report  about last week's incident &amp; he said "no, I have to expect that kind of  behavior here".&#160; I give up!&#160; &#160;Adolf went across the street to pray &amp; to  witness with his sign that read "Planned Parenthood Kills Babies".&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sandy came in to the pregnancy center to help Paul out this afternoon for  we received 10 clients &amp; I received many phone calls too.&#160; Great job you  guys.&#160; I did go into the center while Martha was outside &amp; in came a mother  &amp; her daughter, one of our pregnant clients, telling me that she just found  out today that she was having a boy.&#160; "Yeah" I said back to her &amp; then I  needed to address her very low &amp; short &amp; tight top on a heavily breasted  woman.&#160; I told her to go into the clothing room to get herself some new clothes  for herself &amp; she did.&#160; Yeah again!&#160;&#160; It's nice to be able to help our moms  &amp; to address many aspects of their lives, to make it better.&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I then went back outside&#160;to be with Martha.&#160; A car came out of the parking  lot &amp; the passenger, who looked very pale, gave me her&#160;finger &amp; then I  knew that she just had her precious baby killed.&#160; Oh no Lord!!&#160; &#160;Then I noticed  that a woman was sitting on the bench that is in front of the mill with a young  child about 4 years old playing with her.&#160; I told her that Planned Parenthood  was killing little children &amp; this was not a park but a Killing Mill &amp;  she's bring evil into her life by being here.&#160; No response from her &amp; I know  that she could here me with the mega phone.&#160; Then the Death Escort old woman  walked a young girl out onto the sidewalk &amp; when she got to the woman &amp;  child on the bench she started to wiggle her bottom &amp; to play with the  child.&#160; I almost threw up.&#160; Martha was so upset that she went into the pregnancy  center.&#160; I followed not to long afterwards.&#160; I told the Death Escort that she  was helping to kill children, by holding the door open for&#160;them, to go into this  horrible place to have their baby be killed.&#160; I told her that she was an  accomplice to murder.&#160; Her &amp; her white hair, you'd think that she would know  better but she doesn't.&#160; This place is hell on earth.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp;

we both went out to the  sidewalk together.&#160; We were by ourselves when Dan &amp; Addison came to pray  across the street &amp; then about an 45 minutes later Adolf came to pray.&#160; Dr.  Karen came in the center &amp; I left the sidewalk to talk to her about a  teaching at Focus.&#160; We agreed that Saturday, June 22, 2013 from 11am to 1pm at  Focus would work out very well.&#160; I was very happy, for she will be teaching,  about parenting, self esteem &amp; nutrition to our girls.&#160; Thank you Lord :)&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><div><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><font size="2"><font size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium">When I  came back outside, Martha went into the center to do a pregnancy test, for Paul  came out, to say that there were two girls in the center now requesting  pregnancy tests.&#160;

She had a little  girl with her &amp; she told Martha that years earlier, when she went to Planned  Parenthood, she was told by the nurse that she couldn't hear a heartbeat &amp;  that she should schedule for a termination.&#160;

He was a nice man but a bit confused.&#160; He reassured me  again that he didn't believe in abortion, which I was happy to hear.&#160; He met up  with another gentleman in their parking lot &amp; they both went in the  Administrative door.&#160; I hollered over to them both that Planned Parenthood  doesn't report saturator rape either.&#160; They were in there for an hour or so when  they both came out.&#160; As the man that we spoke to earlier had passed by me, in  his car,&#160;I&#160;hollered to him saying&#160;"please don't do business with the devil".&#160;

I told her that it was a wrong  decision.&#160; She didn't agree.&#160; I went&#160;to the Rose Room to get the brochure on  Tubule Ligation &amp; spoke with her for a few more minutes.&#160; She said that she  had five children &amp; didn't want anymore.&#160; I said that maybe God wasn't going  to give you anymore children, why didn't you trust Him?&#160;&#160;If He did sent you  another child He then would provide for her or him.&#160; She was also post abortive  so I gave her a Truth packet of information &amp; also Post Abortion information  too.&#160; I pray that she will wake up &amp; repent.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We saw a mother &amp;

was passing Planned Parenthood when I saw that Sheila was  using the mega phone on two people, a&#160;male &amp;&#160;a female,&#160;that were walking so  close together very slowly across the street.&#160; My stomach sank.&#160; I spoke briefly  to them when I parked at Focus &amp; got out of the car as they were turning  down Gibbs St..&#160; I felt sick to my stomach because I knew that she had just come  out of Planned Parenthood after having her precious baby killed.&#160; I went into  Focus but I really wanted to go home.&#160; We're out in front of the abortion mill  to try to save babies from being killed so I went into Focus until 1pm, it was  now 12:15 pm.&#160; I greeted Paul &amp; started to do some things at the center  first.&#160; Suzanne&#160;had called to say that she was unable to come this afternoon  &amp; I was very disappointed.&#160; I do understand that she has other commitments  too.&#160; Martha &amp; Paul had already told me that they will be leaving at 4pm  today, oh well :(&#160; When I went outside to relieve Sheila I asked her if that  girl that was walking so slowly had an abortion, hoping that I was wrong.&#160; She  said "yes" &amp; we tried to talk to her but she wouldn't listen.&#160; I wish that  she had.&#160;It's always wonderful to see Sheila &amp; I thank God&#160;for her powerful  presence, in front of Planned Parenthood, every Thursday from 10:30am till 1pm.&#160;  She's a 'life saver'!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I am so happy to report to you that a&#160;precious&#160;wasn't aborted today at  Planned Parenthood!! &#160;I was on the front lines when I saw two girls walking into  Planned&#160;Parenthood&#160; &#160;I called out to them offering them help. &#160;A young lady came  over to the sidewalk &amp; said that she didn't want her God sister to have an  abortion. &#160;I said we don't either &amp; I&#160;handed&#160;her a packet of information  &amp; a DVD, for her friend. &#160;She then went into Planned Parenthood, where her  friend was already. &#160;Martha arrived on the front lines &amp; I had to go into  Focus for a minute. &#160;It was about 15 minutes later that the doorbell ran &amp;  it was the two girls. &#160;Dr. Karen had just arrived &amp; was standing behind  them. &#160;I brought them into the counseling room with Dr. Karen &amp; closed the  door. Sue had come into Focus to bring us some&#160;donations, so Paul &amp; a client  -friend &amp; I&#160;prayed together for this situation. &#160; It was about 10 minutes  later Dr. Karen told me that the abortion minded girl wanted an ultrasound right  away &amp; she wouldn't wait until Wednesday to go to His&#160;Branches,&#160;for one. The  God sister was trying to save this precious baby too. The two girls had gone  back into Planned Parenthood. &#160;Both Dr. Karen &amp; I were very upset &amp; we  prayed&#160;together. &#160;The girl, that was with the abortion minded girl, came outside  later on &amp; I called her over to me. &#160;We talked. &#160;She said that Planned  Parenthood wouldn't let her in the back room with her&#160;friend &#160;She told me that  her mother made her have an abortion at 14 &amp; she was devastated &amp; in  shock by the&#160;gruesome&#160;event that cost her baby's life. I told her that we can  help her too. &#160;We waited together, on the sidewalk, until the young  girl&#160;finally&#160;came out. &#160;She wasn't smiling so I asked her if she had an abortion  &amp; she said "no". &#160;I said then you should be smiling &amp; she did. &#160;Thank  you Lord!!!! &#160;I gave them the Focus brochure &amp; told them to stop by to get  the things that you needed for this precious baby. They said "thank you" &amp;  walked up the street. &#160;Alleluia!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Three guys pulled into the parking lot &amp; went  into the mill.&#160; As they were coming out of the parking lot I looked right at  them &amp; said with a stern voice "no sex outside of marriage".&#160; I guess they  didn't like that comment &amp; the passenger who had a smirk on his face threw  an unwrapped condom at me, so I guess that was their plain before &amp; said  what I said to them.&#160; These are the guys of today :(&#160; we're in trouble :(&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; Paul had left so I was all alone in  the center.&#160; I did things that I needed to do when the doorbell rang,&#160;there were  two young girls at the door.&#160; The one girl asked if we do pregnancy tests her  &amp; I said "yes we do, come follow me" &amp; I lead them into the counseling  room to do the test.&#160; It was negative &amp; I did some teaching &amp; gave her  many brochures that I asked if she'd would share with her friends.&#160; She agreed.&#160;  She was young &amp; sweet.&#160; These guys :(</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to eat at home tonight so I continued to  do my work when the doorbell rang again.&#160; This time it was Natalie form  JustMe.&#160;Faye was away with her daughter who was graduating from Culinary school  in South Carolina.&#160; Great news.&#160; She brought us some diapers &amp; were  packaging them when I told her about Dr. Karen's class at Focus on Jun 22nd from  11am till 1pm.&#160; She asked if&#160;she &amp; Faye could be on board that day to help  the girls who want to find a job.&#160; I said "you sure can, that would be  fantastic"!!&#160; So we planned after that seminar she would also come on Wednesdays  form 6pm to 8pm to assist the girls in need.&#160; I was sooooo happy to hear this  for I felt that the Lord was saying to me that this was the year of teaching.&#160;  Thank you Lord :)</span></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><hr /><div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img width="229" height="229" align="right" alt="Photo: Trust me, I know it's hard!

Kennedy came to administer  the Sacrament of Baptism, to this very, very tiny&#160;little boy.&#160;&#160;We didn't think  he would make it&#160;&amp; we were wrong, thank you Lord!!&#160; Pat never thought that  :)&#160;&#160;I told her that I was trying to call her but the phone just kept on ringing  with no answer.&#160; She said that it was turned off, I guess there is no money for  a phone&#160; :(&#160;&#160; It was great to see her again.&#160; I invited her to stay for the Mass  &amp; she said that she would.&#160; I also asked her if she would give her testimony  &amp; she said "no" but she changed her mind after Mass &amp; spoke about her  family for 20 minutes....it was terrific!</span></span>&#160;</div><div style="text-align: left;">&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the people started to arrive for our Mass.&#160;  Fr.

We put the chairs back  into the room.&#160; Who would want to be in a pregnancy center, except us??&#160; It  would change the dynamics.&#160; We'll see, in time.&#160; We hope not!!&#160; The doorbell  rang &amp; there were five adults &amp; one child.&#160; Okay.&#160; One young girl was  with her mother &amp; she wanted a pregnancy test so Martha did it.&#160; She was  pregnant so we called for an ultrasound for tomorrow.&#160; The other woman was five  months pregnant so I told her to come back again around the time of delivery for  new baby clothes &amp; she said that she would.&#160; She was with her husband &amp;  his father &amp; her child.&#160; Nice family.&#160; Sue came in to help us &amp; then  Paul came.&#160; The doorbell just rang &amp; rang.&#160; I received a call from Kay  saying that her &amp; her husband &amp; a friend were going to bring over the  donations there were given to Focus for Mother's Day.&#160;

A mother of three children had  cone in &amp; saw the car seat &amp; the pac n' play &amp; received them both.&#160;  She was sooooo happy :)&#160; We had to call to see if the items were on recall &amp;  they weren't.&#160; We received new &amp; slightly used baby &amp; children clothes,  diaper, baby wipes &amp; baby shampoo &amp; lotion, etc..&#160; It was great!!!!&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang again &amp; it was Chris &amp;  Jennifer to receive more Truth packets for their front lines ministry on  Tuesdays.&#160; Great job girls!!&#160; Martha was asked to give another pregnancy test  which was positive &amp; we set up another ultrasound for tomorrow.&#160; Later on  Martha did another pregnancy test &amp; it was negative.&#160;&#160;The young  girl&#160;received a Depo shot from Planned Parenthood, about a month ago, &amp; she  didn't get a period so she thought that she was pregnant.&#160; The girls&#160;usually  do.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Lisa came in &amp;

that happens.&#160; She also left messages  &amp; spoke with some of the clients &amp; all is well with them.&#160; Lisa called  the companies of the pac n' play &amp; car seat, that we also received today.&#160;  She was busy for hours too.&#160; Linda came in at 3:30pm &amp; worked for a couple  of hours.&#160; Sue had to go &amp; she worked so very hard for so very long.&#160; Thank  you Focus volunteers for ALL the hard work that you put into our pregnancy  center for our girls &amp; guys.&#160; We had a couple of men at Focus today, it's  always good to see them.&#160; I try to than then for being a great father. &#160;I wish  that there were more out there in our community.&#160;

I was in a slump because of my  chronic pain &amp; bad big toe but I got through the day.&#160; Then the doorbell  rang again &amp; it was Dawn, from the Elizabeth Ministry at St. Louis Church,  dropping off many nice things for&#160;our clients &amp;

all the other items.&#160; The doorbell  rang again &amp; we helped out this mom too.&#160; It is a nice feeling to be able to  assist the people that need help.&#160; Then Lynda came in &amp; we all talked for  about 10 minutes &amp; then she went outside, on the front lines, to pray &amp;  to witness &amp; to talk to the people going into the local death mill, Planned  Parenthood.&#160; When she came back into the center, about an hour later, she said  that she spoke with one woman, to no avail.&#160; It's sometimes very difficult but  we need to be there so that we can at least plant the seed.&#160; No seed, no crop.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul &amp;

was told that the one young lady had been at Planned Parenthood  &amp; had changed her&#160;mind&#160;about aborting her baby. &#160;Her mother was with her.  &#160;She filled out an Intake Sheet &amp; I made an appointment for her to have  an&#160;ultrasound&#160;by Dr. Karen next week at His Branches. &#160;She was also given  brochures, a growth &amp;&#160;development&#160;book &amp; DVD. &#160;Focus will now care for  this family.

When you hear a sweet,  soft voice reveling something to you, at any time, you must ask for a  confirmation because it could be the voice of the Lord or the Enemy.&#160; I knew it  wasn't my voice because I was just walking into the bathroom, <span style="font-size: medium;">to get</span> ready for  the day, &amp; I wasn't even thinking about what was revealed but there it was  right in front of me.&#160; You shall know the "Truth &amp; the Truth shall set you  free" but first it can make you miserable.&#160; The Truth has power because it is of  God.&#160; It was a revelation about my earlier childhood that was abusive &amp;  traumatic.&#160; I was a bit rattles from this revelation but I knew if it was from  the Lord them it will be okay, in time.&#160; I prayed for the confirmation which  came later, so I knew it was the Truth.&#160; Now what Lord?&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I then went to Mass &amp; then to the bank for  Focus &amp; then to McDonald's for lunch.&#160; I was tired &amp; still shaken from  the morning but I decided to go now to Focus, even it was early.&#160; When I arrived  there was Sheila walking into the parking lot.&#160; I saw three young girls heading  towards the center but I figured the Paul was in there &amp; he would answer the  doorbell.&#160; I spoke with Sheila &amp; she said that she had to go now for an eye  appointment &amp; she wouldn't be&#160;here next Thursday for she had a class but  after that she'll be back.&#160; Okay I said back to her.&#160; Then we noticed that the  three girls didn't get into the center &amp; were walking away.&#160; I said that I'd  let them in &amp; I did.&#160; Then I turned to them asking what they needed &amp;  the one girl said that she wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I almost dropped to the  floor.&#160; "Okay" I&#160;said &amp; I lead them to the Rose Room.&#160; While the&#160;client was  in the bathroom&#160;I said to the two girls, that Planned Parenthood was killing off  their Race.&#160; The one girl said "oh no their not".&#160; It went down hill after  that.&#160; I was ready to have them leave so that I could consecrate on the girl who  came for the pregnancy&#160;test but I didn't.&#160; The Lord had me in His grace.&#160; Then  the one girl said that abortion was a choice of the woman &amp; what if she was  raped?&#160; I looked right at her &amp; said "I was ganged raped &amp; I didn't  murder my twins".&#160; It was back &amp; forth with these two girls so I decided not  to give them anymore verbal information so I set up the Truth packet with many  more brochures for the three girls to read &amp; to get educated.&#160; When  the&#160;young girl&#160;came back from the bathroom&#160;I asked her how she found out about  Focus.&#160; The two girls were giggling so I said "what Planned Parenthood sent you  here.&#160; "Do you know&#160;why", I said,&#160;it's because their so busy killing babies  &amp; they don't have time to do pregnancy tests".&#160; I was stern with what&#160;I was  saying to these girls.&#160; The pregnancy test was negative &amp; I said to the  young girl,&#160; face to face, no sex until your married &amp; you don't have to  worry about pregnancy or sexual transmitted diseases".&#160; This girl was 19 years  old &amp; she had a miscarriage at 15.&#160; Why are these girls submitting to these,  none caring boys?&#160; It's so very sad. I then handed the plastic bag filled with  information &amp; showed then the Material Aid Room &amp; said that if they  needed us again please come back.&#160; They left &amp; later on when I came into the  center I saw that she had put the plastic bag filled with literature in the  trash can next to our front door.&#160; After they let Focus I was told by Mike who  was on the sidewalk that they went back into Planned Parenthood.........these  girls need lots of prayer.&#160; I felt badly that I didn't do better with  them.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha came into the center &amp; then went out to  the front lines.&#160; I had to stay in because I was expecting Katherine to come to  volunteer &amp; I wanted to show her around.&#160; She came &amp; I greeted her.&#160;  Paul was in the center so after I orientated her I knew that she would be fine.&#160;  Suzanne came later &amp; they all worked hard, because they saw 12 people, who  came in with needs to be meant.&#160; Kathleen will be back from 1 to 4pm in two  weeks.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I was now on the sidewalk with Martha who was with  Tom.&#160; I set up the signs, for there was a bit a wind which blows the signs into  the street, no fun.&#160; Tom had now let &amp; at 2pm Adolf came to pray &amp; to  witness across the street.&#160; Dan came around 3pm today.&#160; A car came out of  Planned Parenthood &amp; when she saw us she started to make faces &amp; act  funny.&#160; She had a wrist band on her arm so I knew that she had just had her  little baby killed by the abortionist in there.&#160; This scenario happened again  today.&#160; How evil is killing your baby &amp; someone helping you.&#160; I hope that  they&#160;all repent.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I got to talk to some people who were  walking by &amp; gave them informational packets &amp; showed them Focus was, if  they needed us.&#160; &#160;We went back into the center at 4pm.&#160; I said "good bye" to  Katherine&#160;&amp; said that we'll see her in two weeks.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp;  it was Dan.&#160; We haven't seen him in so long because of his job.&#160; He said that he  got a new job it will be days instead of nights.&#160; Yeah!!!&#160; We got to visit with  him for awhile.&#160; Then just after we finished supper the doorbell rang &amp; it  was Faye.&#160; She comes once a month to help us along with Natalie, who came  later.&#160; It was nice visiting with them too.&#160; Martha left for her Holy Hour &amp;  I closed up the center around 8:30pm tonight. </span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-size: medium;"><hr /><div align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img border="0" src="http://spiritdaily.com/Guardian%20Angekids2a.jpg" style="WIDTH: 111px; HEIGHT: 145px" alt="" /></font></div><div align="left">&#160;</div><div align="left">&#160;</div><div align="left"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Tuesday, May 28, 2013 at  Focus</span></span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This day was so busy!&#160; We attended to 14  clients &amp; their children, for those who brought them, into the center.&#160; Sue  &amp; Linda &amp; Lisa came to help us out with the donations.&#160;What a  team!!!&#160;&#160;Paul didn't come today.

Martha did two pregnancy tests that were  positive &amp; we scheduled an ultrasound for them for next Wednesday.&#160; They  were young girls &amp; one was post abortive, her mother forced her to have an  abortion but she won't this time because she's older now &amp; in control.&#160; I  always ask the girls if they have asked God to forgive them for this grievous  sin &amp; then give them brochures, to help them, in the healing process.&#160; After  they left Martha did another pregnancy test &amp; it was negative....thank God.&#160;  We always teach abstinence, after each negative pregnancy test, &amp; give them  appropriate brochures to assist them in making better decisions, in their  lives.&#160;

Her mother called me to  say that she had changed her mind &amp; wanted the rods out of her &amp; if I  could help.&#160; I was devastated first, but I had to give her the helpful  information, to save this precious baby's life.&#160;

I asked for her to call me back after they saw  the doctor but I never received a call back, so I was worried.&#160; I then called  Sheila, for she was the first contact of the mother &amp; daughter coming out of  the Killing Mill, weeks ago.&#160;&#160;She said that she was going to call Miss S. to see  what had happened.&#160;

 She picked you the phone with the first ring.&#160; I asked what had happened &amp;  she said that she called twice last night &amp; left a message on the phone  &amp; no one called her back.&#160; I asked if she would call again this morning  &amp; she said that she would.&#160; She also said that she won't call me back if she  doesn't reach Miss S. or her mother &amp; she would call back if she did connect  with one of them.&#160; I agreed &amp; said "thank you &amp; good bye" &amp; hung  up.&#160; I was upset still &amp; decided to eat breakfast which I threw up.&#160; I  called Martha to tell her that I might not be at Focus today &amp; she  understood.&#160; After I hung up with her the phone rang &amp; it was Sheila saying  that Miss S. was still pregnant &amp; that Dr. Morehouse took out the rods  yesterday evening &amp; that she was going for an ultrasound, with Dr. Karen at  1:45pm today.&#160; I was sooooo happy to hear this great news.&#160; Praise God, that all  worked out for this precious baby again, that mom keeps on trying to have  killed.&#160; What is wrong with some pregnant moms??????&#160; Sheila told her that if  she gets tempted again just call her &amp; she'll take&#160;her to lunch.&#160; Okay  Sheila this is a great idea!!!&#160; God bless you always, you life saver you!!!!&#160; I  felt much better &amp; I got ready to go to Church &amp; then to Focus.&#160; Before  I got into my car I received a phone call asking if we do pregnancy test which I  replied "yes" &amp; I gave the days &amp; times that we were open.&#160; The I  received a call from a&#160;woman who was referred by&#160;the&#160;Salvation Army.&#160; I answered  her questions &amp; she said that&#160;she would stop by Focus today to get some  diapers &amp; things for her baby.&#160; "Okay, see you later &amp; have a great day"  I said &amp; then I hung up the phone.&#160;&#160;I was a few minutes late for Mass, which  I wasn't happy about.&#160; I need to leave earlier.&#160; After Mass I stopped Officer  Mike &amp; spoke to him about my relative which I just found out was in jail  &amp; was going to be transferred to prison for 5 years for robbing three  convenient stores with a&#160;BB gun, along with some gang members.&#160; Not to smart.&#160; I  want him to start his 'new life' in prison &amp; I was asking what could be done  for him to make this happen.&#160; This poor soul has had a rough life &amp; was  almost aborted 18 years ago &amp; his father was&#160;murdered on&#160;a street in  Rochester &amp; he has 21 half brothers &amp; sisters &amp; a mix-up up mother  too.&#160; He didn't complete his High School credits either.&#160; It's so very, very ,  very sad.&#160; But if you do the crime you must do the time. I hope &amp; pray that  he will come out of prison better then when he went in.I t's a rough place but  there is always hope in God to protect him, to change him &amp; to heal him.&#160; I  will trust in Him!!!&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; Paul &amp; I saw 14 clients today,  even though the men were tarring the parking lot, right in front of our door.&#160;  We were so busy that I was stressed out &amp; not always patient with Paul,  though he understands me.&#160; I was sorry about not being patient with him.&#160; I also  apologized to Martha for we disagreed about a pac'n play that she just received  from Angel Care &amp; now couldn't reach the client, so I asked her to give it  to another mom who needed it, but she wanted to wait.&#160; I said "okay but not for  very long".&#160;This client was now unreachable but she might stop in at any time we  really don't know.&#160; I know that she was disappointed &amp; I should have  understood that. &#160;It can get icky in there, at times, but not very often &amp; we al<span style="font-size: medium;">l</span> get along very well.&#160; Thank God!!!&#160; <font size="2">:) </font></span><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></span></strong></div></span></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;">&#160;</div><hr /><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font size="2"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-weight: bold;" id="TitleLabel">Prayerful  Fidelity'</span></span></strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"> <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 16px;" id="SPAN2"><span style="font-size: 16px;" id="TextLabel">Peace,  patience, and above all prayerful fidelity in suffering  constitute the  path most of us are called to travel.

Bill would be coming later today.&#160; I got up  &amp; got ready &amp; was there on the sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood  at 8:50am.&#160; I saw that a car was zooming into the parking lot &amp; was dropping  off a young girl into the abortion mill.&#160; As the car was leaving I hollered out  to the female driver that if she had dropped off a girl for an abortion that she  was an accomplice to this murder of this innocent baby.&#160; She had a angry look on  her face &amp; drove fast out onto the street.&#160; I went over to the fence &amp;  started to try to speak to the girl that was just dropped off to try to save her  baby's life.&#160; I don't know what the outcome for this was for Bill had just  arrived &amp; Pat came about 10 minutes later.&#160; I spoke with the two of them  &amp; then went into the pregnancy center so that they could start their time  out there on the front lines.&#160; I did leave the graphic picture out there against  the tree.&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I answered the Focus Pregnancy Center's door today to let a pregnant mother  in, around 12:10pm. &#160;When she got into the hallway she told me that she had, in  the past, been to Planned Parenthood and was going for &#160;abortion but she saw our  graphic pictures, on the front lines &amp; left the clinic. &#160;She said that we  gave her an informational packet &amp; a DVD. &#160;When she saw the DVD later on,  she cried. &#160;Her precious daughter is due on October 10, 2013. &#160;I gave her some  brand new things for her sweet baby. &#160;I asked what she had named her child &amp;  she said "Justice". &#160;Praise God for this wonderful, unexpected &#160;news!&#160; I was so  happy for this great news!!&#160; Wish there were more.</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">It was now 1pm &amp; Kathleen, who helps us out on  Thursdays,&#160;just came into the center &amp; Martha came a few minutes later.&#160; I  was happy to see them both.&#160; Rob then came in &amp; got what he needed for the  sidewalk ministry.&#160; So Paul &amp; Kathleen were the two who were going to help  out our clients, in the center.&#160; Then Martha, Rob &amp; I went out to the front  lines.&#160; Rob went over to the other side of the building to witness.&#160; I saw  Sheila when I went out &amp; spoke with her for a few minutes &amp; then to Mike  before he left.&#160; It is always so difficult out there where they are murdering  little defenseless babies, for money.&#160; Then I saw the abortionist drive in with  two young females with her in the car.&#160; Oh no.....more abortionist!!!!&#160; She's  probably training these women to have them kill too.&#160; How sad!</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">It was now 2pm &amp;

It was  now later &amp; Martha went in to the center &amp; then she called me to tell me  that it was so busy there that she decided to stay in to help Paul&#160;&amp;  Kathleen.&#160; Fine Martha.&#160; It was now 5pm &amp; the woman with the blur Planned  Parenthood apron came out to the sidewalk with her sign that read 'Parking at  Planned Parenthood $5'.&#160; They were trying to reel them in to park there for the  yearly Jazz Festival.&#160; Icky!&#160; &#160;&#160;Rob &amp; I stayed to witness more.&#160; The first  car that drove in to park had two children in the car.&#160; When the family were  walking out of the parking lot to the street the little girl fell right on her  knees.&#160; They took her back to the car to fix her up &amp; then all four of them  came back out to enjoy the festival.&#160; Poor kids to have parents that don't car  that PP is killing little children.&#160; No cars came in for about 30 minutes for  they saw our graphic signs &amp; read the sign that says 'Planned Parenthood  Kills Babies'.&#160; Rob &amp; I tried to witness to the woman who was holding the  sign &amp; then her husband, who works at PP came over to her with his blue  apron too.&#160; When the cars started to drive in we knew that these people were  hard &amp; uncaring.&#160; Rob &amp; I tried to witness to these people but they had  those 'far away faces' &amp; we knew that they just didn't&#160;care :(&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><div><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;It was close to 6pm so we decided to go into Focus  for supper.&#160;

 Planned Parenthood doesn't go beyond that time &amp; they referred her to Strong  Memorail Hospital which does abortions in the second trimester.&#160; My stomach  churned &amp; I was so upset to hear this.&#160; I said "I pray that you're not going  to have an abortion" &amp; she said "no, I'm not".&#160; "Thank God" I said "&amp;  I'll send you some information that will also help you".&#160; She said "that would  be great".&#160; I asked her to keep in touch with me &amp; to call me if she just  needed to talk or needed anything for her other two children.&#160; She said that she  would &amp; thank you.&#160; I said "good bye" &amp;

How  wonderful!!&#160; About 30 minutes&#160;later the ex husband had left &amp; then&#160;the  man&#160;came out &amp; asked us who would like to come in first.&#160; There was silence  then Martha spoke up to say "I'll go first".&#160; Okay, fine with me.&#160;It was about  30 minutes&#160;later that Martha came out &amp;&#160;I was told to wait until someone  comes out to get me.&#160; It was my turn.&#160; I was lead into a large room where there  were three people one was a African American woman, who the Attorney for the  City.&#160; I was introduced to all of the people &amp; shore to tell the truth the  whole truth so help me God.&#160; I said that I was happy that they still used the  name of God&#160;&amp;&#160;the stenographer&#160;smiled at me &amp; said "yes".&#160; Then the  questions started.&#160; One after another.&#160; After abput 35 minutes later&#160;it  was&#160;resolved that the woman probably slipped on the ice in February in 2011  &amp; not by the sidewak, for nothing was wrong with it.&#160; Ironically, I had  written on my website that day in 2011, that she had tripped in the ice, so I  rest my case.&#160; The lawyer&#160;pulled up&#160;the website &amp; looked it up, I didn't  even know that I had&#160;written that in for I didn't know the date of the incident  until today.&#160; You can't sue ice!!!&#160; It took a lot out of Martha &amp;&#160;I, but we  were summoned to be here this morning.&#160;

Poor guy, he worked on  it for about 45 minutes but was happy that when he left, it came with him.&#160; Paul  brought him home.&#160; He said that he would come tomorrow to the front lines to  protest with us, for there is where he first meet us, a couple of years ago.&#160;

got  ready to go to Focus at 1pm.&#160; When I arrived to the center, in the parking  lot,&#160;there were three women &amp; three children, waiting for me to open up the  center.&#160; Paul wasn't there so I opened up the door &amp; recommend to the ladies  that maybe if they come on a Thursday that they&#160;could come a little later  because of the situation we face on this day.&#160; Then the door to the Rose Room  opened up &amp; out came Sheila &amp; two young people, a girl &amp; a guy &amp;  they were smiling.&#160; Sheila had done a pregnancy test.&#160; I greeted Sheila &amp;  went on with what I had to do.&#160; The one woman who came in with me was a regular  client, for she takes care of her many grandchildren &amp; the other two girls  have been to Focus before.&#160; One of the girls was pregnant.&#160; I wish that I could  have spent some time with her but I did ask her to fill out an Intake Sheet for  our records &amp; I gave her some boy clothes &amp; told her to come back  again.&#160; I wanted her to smile, for she looked so sad,&#160;&amp;&#160;I finally got her  too.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; Mike V. came into the center, from the sidewalk, &amp; gave me  some money from his son &amp; asked for a Mass for him which I said that I would  do.&#160; I had no time to talk for I was suppose to be out on the front lines now  &amp; I was&#160;still in the pregnancy center.&#160; Martha came around 1:10pm &amp;  brought in her food for the supper tonight, after Mass.&#160; She then went to the  front lines &amp; I did more things in the center &amp; then Karen came in to  help us.&#160;

Martha said that the man in the van started to turn up the volume  of the radio,&#160;when she started to speak to him.&#160; I spoke with him &amp; then a  lady from inside Planned Parenthood came out to ask him to turn it down.&#160; He did  for about 5 seconds &amp; then&#160;turned&#160; it&#160;up again.&#160; One of the prayer warriors  went into Buckpitt's parking lot to take down his license&#160; number.&#160; I said to  him that we now have your license number for a police report,&#160;then he finally  turned it down.&#160; We can only hope that he didn't bring someone into Planned  Parenthood to have her baby be killed here today.&#160; It was about 20 minutes later  that she came out &amp; went into the van&#160;they drove off.</span>&#160;</span></div></span></span><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then a young man  came out onto the sidewalk &amp; asked what we doing here.&#160; Martha &amp; I  invited him over to where we were standing.&#160; He said that his ex girlfriend was  here for an abortion but he didn't want her to do it.&#160; He did look sad.&#160; I  reached in the literature box to get out a brochure for 'Men Only After An  Abortion' &amp; handed it to him.&#160; Martha gave him a Rosary to take with him  &amp; she spoke with him for a few more minutes &amp; then he left.&#160; It was  about 15 minutes later that when Martha was in the center&#160;he came back out &amp;  walked over to me with his shirt off &amp; his paints slightly low, you  could&#160;see part of his underwear.&#160; He said to me "God forgives doesn't He".&#160; I  said "yes of course He forgives, with a sincere heart, but we're not suppose to  kill our children".&#160; I then asked him to go back in there to save his baby's  life.&#160; He said that she already had the abortion.&#160; Then I asked him why he was  still here &amp; if he had driven her here.&#160; He replied back to me that he had  told her that he would support her in her abortion decision, if that's what she  wanted.&#160; I almost fainted, for this isn't what he had projected earlier to  Martha &amp; I.&#160; I said back to him, with a deep breath, "your an accomplice&#160;in  you baby's killing &amp; you need to repent".&#160; I asked his name &amp; the name  of his girlfriend to pray for them.&#160; He gave me their names &amp; walked back  into the Abortion Mill.&#160; Lord have Mercy!!!!&#160; My heart ached :(</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div><div>&#160;</div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was standing on the sidewalk holding a graphic  sign of a precious aborted baby, a woman came to the sidewalk form Planned  Parenthood just stood there.&#160; I asked her if I could help her &amp; she said  that she wasn't pregnant.&#160; Then she said that she was going to call the police  because I abused one of the worker of planned Parenthood.&#160; I knew it was about  the Death Escort because I had just said to her "I pray that you don't have a  stroke or heart attack because you haven't repented yet".&#160; I then said to this  woman "if you continue to harass me I'll call the police &amp; I'll make out a  police report".&#160; She was gone, in a flash.&#160; Then Rick Bartell came out to the  front lines,&#160;with his bazaar attitude, &amp; looked around then he left &amp;  went to put on a Death Escort apron on.&#160; Nothing changes, like years ago!!!!&#160;  I've learned, a long time ago, that some people you just can't talk to you just  have to let go &amp; stand your ground!!</span></div></span></div></span></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thank God. today that&#160;there w<span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">ere</font></span> three men, who prayed the rosary across the  street, &amp; Mary Anne who prays on the brick side of Planned Parenthood.&#160; It&#160;was a powerful blessing.&#160; Then all of a sudden, the man that came to  Focus Pregnancy Center yesterday for some <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">clothes </span></span>for his baby that was just  born, came to join us out here on the front lines.&#160; We greeted him &amp; said  that it was great that he was here.&#160; He then took a graphic sign &amp; went to  join Mary Ann on the brick side, right in front of Planned Parenthood, to  witness.&#160; Praise God, an African American man, with a purpose to 'save children'  from being killed here at Planned Parenthood!!!!!!&#160; Miracles do  happen!!!!!!<br /></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha had come back outside with me.&#160;&#160; We were calling out to every car  that had pulled into the parking lot t give them vital information to try to  save their baby's life.&#160; Then a man with a small dog came from around the  bushes.&#160; He said "isn't it to hot for you to out here".&#160; "No" was our response.&#160;  He then started to say to us that she is only 13 years old &amp; she's a kid  having a kid".&#160; Martha talked to him more then I did but by some weird reason I  thought that this 13 year old girl had already had her baby but Martha later on  said that "no, she was here for an abortion".&#160; I just didn't want to here that  she had her precious baby killed.&#160; If you have your period then you can have a  baby.&#160; What people are doing to their children, souls &amp; bodies is beyond  me!!!!&#160; This girl was probably brought in by this goofy man &amp; someone else,  for he can't be in PP with a dog.&#160; They will wish someday that they weren't here  doing what they did.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Suzanne, our client advocate, was here today too &amp;

I have problems out on  the front lines seeing women&#160;going in &amp; out after they have had their baby  killed at Planned Parenthood......it's horrible.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; I went  to the door to open it for Karen.&#160;&#160;I greeted her &amp; then the gentleman came  to the door asking to use the mega phone.&#160; I asked if he could use his own voice  out there &amp; he agreed &amp; left to go back to the front lines.&#160; A few  minutes later he came back into Focus with attitude &amp; told Rob, who just  came back into the center, that he was going.&#160; I didn't know that he was upset  so I said "we'll see you next Thursday"!&#160; He replied "maybe yes or maybe not".&#160;  He was now gone.&#160; Rob then said, with much apprehension, that he just spoke with  a woman out there that was planning to have an abortion.&#160; "She went into Planned  Parenthood", he said.&#160; "Please pray he added.&#160; Karen put her head down right  away &amp; was praying.&#160; My heart sunk &amp; I said a short prayer but was  discouraged that she probably would have an abortion.&#160; I thought, "God is in  control".&#160;

he was standing at the front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; A young woman  walked&#160;up the sidewalk &amp; stopped to talk with Rob.&#160; She said that is 29  years old &amp; has three children &amp; wants an abortion because she didn't  think that she could handle baby number four.&#160; Her boyfriend didn't want her to  have an abortion.&#160; This mother was by herself.&#160; Rob gave her a bag filled with  many informational brochures &amp; a rosary &amp; he said that the Focus  Pregnancy Center, which was down the sidewalk, could help her with baby things  for 'free'.&#160;&#160;She did go into Planned Parenthood &amp; then&#160;Rob rushed into Focus  where Martha, Karen, Paul &amp; I were &amp; told us to pray for her.&#160; We did.&#160;  It was about 2 hours later she came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; went over to  where Rob was standing &amp; then she came over to where I was standing on the  other side of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She greeted me &amp;  asked for our&#160;Focus&#160;brochure &amp; I gave her one.&#160; She said that she  didn't&#160;have time to go today but will stop by the center soon!!&#160; &#160;I smiled.&#160;  Later on Rob told me that she told him that she didn't have the abortion.&#160;  Praise God!!!&#160;&#160; Well done Rob.&#160; Great job prayer warrior :)&#160; Thank you  Lord. <br /></span></div></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">PLEASE GO&#160;TO&#160;#&#160;20 FOR&#160;MORE&#160;FRONT&#160;LINE&#160;WEEKLY</span></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: left;">&#160;</div><div style="text-align: left;">&#160;</div><div><font size="2"><hr /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&lt;<a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=199&amp;tabid=211">Previous</a> | <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=212&amp;tabid=211">Next</a>&gt;
