I  was blessed to have met a woman who just had a C-Section, not to long&#160;ago.&#160; Her precious baby was saved,  from being aborted at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Martha &amp; I met her out on the  front lines, on a cold winter's day in January &amp; brought her to Focus for  assistance. &#160;Her precious daughter Justice was born on October 3, 2013 at 5  lbs. 14 ozs.. Both mother &amp; beautiful baby girl are doing well, though because of the C-Section, she really shouldn't be driving yet. &#160;Mom is so  happy &amp; so are we. &#160;She received some nice things today in the material aid  rooms at Focus.&#160;&#160; There was a pregnant young lady with her &amp; I was told that  she was thinking about adoption for her baby girl.&#160; She is 16 years old &amp; her  mother isn't supportive &amp; she lives with her.&#160; Her boyfriend has no means to  financial support for this baby either.&#160; I then thought of Anna, who's been coming  into Focus for years with her wonderful donations, from her home.&#160; The last time  she was here she mentioned that her &amp; her husband wanted to adopt a child.&#160;  She has two biological children.&#160; I then asked this young lady if she would like  Anna to call her to speak with her.&#160; She said "yes" &amp; she gave me her name &amp;  phone number.&#160; This was surreal.&#160; I later called Anna to tell her of the great  news!!!&#160; She said that she will call her on Friday.&#160; Praise God!&#160; We've never  done this before.

she got to work.&#160; The lady who works  in the small room let her into the center.&#160; It was 1:30pm &amp; Becky came to  help us out.&#160; She must have heard me say something because I didn't ask her to  go out to the front lines.&#160; All of a sudden she said to me "I'll go outside if  you want me to".&#160; I answered back to her "if you don't mind&#160; sure would like you  to join Cathy outside", &amp; she did.&#160; She was out there for three hours.&#160; In  the meantime I called Mike from Rescue Rochester if him &amp; his team would  take over Thursdays from 1to 4 or 5pm.&#160; He said that he will speak with Jerry  &amp; get back to me.&#160; I said "thank you" &amp; hung up the phone.&#160; I'll have to  pray &amp; wait for an answer.&#160; Martha got to the center at 1:40pm.&#160; I asked her  what had happened &amp; she said that she was with her daughter &amp; her  grandbaby &amp; she couldn't let go of him.&#160; I was happy that she was okay &amp;  I really did understand, for it's a miracle that she comes on Thursdays at all.&#160;  It's such a hard day for all of us but we want&#160;to save lives of little precious  babies &amp;

I was told that&#160;her &amp; her friend then went over to Planned  Parenthood &amp; I was determined to speak with her when she came back again.&#160; I  wen over to her as she was shopping &amp; asked her what that was all about.&#160;  She said that her friend wanted a Sexual Transmitted Disease test.&#160; I then said  to her that all you have to do is ask &amp; we will provide for you &amp; your  needs.&#160; I asked her to wait for a few minutes while I went into to the Rose Room  to get her two brochures for this need.&#160; I then handed them to her saying that  these are the two places that can help her friend.&#160; She accepted them readily  &amp; then left when she was finished shopping.&#160; We want to educate our girls to  the people that can really help them with love &amp; truth. <br /></span></div><div align="left"><div align="left">&#160;</div><div align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul was with us &amp; drove a client  home with her friends.&#160; Then I received a call from her saying that she  forgot&#160;the diapers that were in&#160;his trunk, so Paul went back to her&#160;house to  give them to her.&#160; He's such a&#160;great guy. &#160;Later on the doorbell rang &amp; it  was such a wonderful surprise to see Faye again, she came with Natalie tonight,  to help us out.&#160; Faye had hand surgery which caused her so many health problems  but she's doing so much better now.&#160; It was a blessing for them both, with  us</span>,&#160;<span style="font-size: medium;">at Focus.&#160; Natalie spoke with me about getting us a new volunteer &amp; I  hope that it will work out.&#160; She emailed her friend &amp; I emailed her back.&#160; I  hope that it will happen.&#160; David came tonight&#160;&amp; was a big help.&#160; Suzanne I  guess won't be back until she feels better.&#160;

Mickey, a wonderful Priest.&#160; I gave her two DVD's  &amp; lots of literature that were appropriate for her needs.&#160; I stood up &amp;  invited her to go shopping in our two material aid rooms for herself &amp; her  other child.&#160; I said that when she gets closer to her due date &amp; knows the  sex of the bay we will give her a Layette.&#160; She smiled.&#160; I said "good bye &amp;  we are here for you".&#160; It was an intense  interview but I hoped that I helped her.</span></span></strong>&#160;</div><p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">When I went back in to the Green Room there was so  much happening.&#160; The tables were being set up &amp; the food was heating up in  the microwave.&#160; I went to the Great Room &amp; started to set up the Alter.&#160; So  much to do but it always gets done.&#160; I went back to the office to see that Linda  was sick today &amp; wasn't coming.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; it was Lisa.&#160; I  asked her if she would continue to call our pregnant clients to see if they  needed anything.&#160; She said "okay Mary I will".&#160; I'm always relieved that she's  calling our clients for they are very important to us.&#160; No new babies so far,  though I know of two that were due.&#160; It's sometimes difficult to reach our  clients by phone.&#160; I received an email from Job saying that he was sick &amp;  was unable to come to the 5pm meeting regarding the new Focus Pregnancy Center's  web site.&#160; I was so disappointed &amp; upset.&#160; I hoped that he was okay but was  disappointed that he wasn't coming for Fr. Edison &amp; Lou Ann were attending  the meeting&#160;tonight.&#160; I really couldn't even pray.&#160; I think that I was angry for  I was miserable with my legs &amp; could hardly walk but was I&#160;hear so what  couldn't he be hear too.&#160; So unreasonable don't you think.&#160; The doorbell rang  &amp; it was Fr.

The doorbell rang again &amp; it was Lou Ann.&#160; I  lead Father &amp; Lou Ann into the Rose Room for the meeting.&#160; She gave us some  paperwork &amp; started talking, after our prayer to God, for guidance.&#160; She was  discussing she work on her presentation at RIT College about Focus.&#160; It was  wonderful to hear.&#160; Then all of a sudden I saw Job &amp; he came into the room.&#160;  It was so surreal.&#160; He said that he had a Migraine &amp; took 800 mg. of pain  medication &amp; was feeling better.&#160; Good to hear.&#160; After a few minutes he said  "I don't know why I didn't say this first but my wife is pregnant with baby #  5".&#160; We all congratulated him on hearing this&#160;wonderful news.&#160; He was happy  too.&#160; Then he began to discuss the web site that he was doing for Focus for  'free'.&#160; It sounds so good &amp; it will be so beneficial to the girls that are  looking for help on line.&#160; I'm so excited.&#160; Then Lou Ann said that her  sister-in-law created two new logos, for Focus, but it will be a surprise for me  to see in a couple of weeks.&#160; I can choose the better one for our pregnancy  center.&#160; Can't wait.&#160; The meeting was so beneficial but it had to end because  Father had to celebrate Mass &amp; then be on his way, for he had an appointment  at 7pm somewhere else.&#160; Rush, rush, rush.&#160;</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></strong><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font></div><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />

a sign.&#160; I gave him the graphic one of the precious aborted  baby &amp; he went back outside.&#160; I decided to go out leaving Focus without a  volunteer.&#160; I figured that when someone was ringing the bell &amp; no one  answered then she would call the number on the door &amp; I would come back  to&#160;open up the center for her.&#160; But that wasn't the case this afternoon.&#160; I put  my coat on &amp; started towards the front door when I saw three young girls at  the door.&#160; I opened the door &amp; let them in.&#160; I said "do you all have  children" &amp; the one girl asked for a pregnancy test.&#160; I almost flipped  because I was headed out to the front lines.&#160; God is in control so I lead her to  the Rose Room &amp;&#160;the other two girls followed&#160;us.&#160; I&#160;stated that there be  just the client in the&#160;room but she asked for her sister to be with her, so I  said "okay".&#160;&#160;&#160;She filled out the Intake Sheet as the doorbell was ringing.&#160; It  was the woman who wanted the stroller &amp; she was with her friend, who has  five children.&#160; I let them in &amp; said that Martha wasted here yet to call on  the stroller to see if there were any Recalls but shop around until I finish  what I was doing.&#160; One should not be alone in a pregnancy center I needed more  help.&#160; I went back to the Rose Room &amp; continued my interview.&#160; I called for  her sister to come in as the test was at hand.&#160; The two girls came in  together...not an easy time for the director.&#160; As we were waiting for the  results of the test the room became a nightmare for me.&#160; I asked the girl saying  "how can a mother kill her baby"?&#160; I didn't know why I was saying that to her at  this time but I did.&#160; Then the one girl said"I had to have an abortion for my  life was a mess"!&#160; I said "no you didn't it never okay to have an abortion, it's  always evil".&#160; I said "adoption would have been the answer".&#160; I now saw that she  was pregnant &amp; she was rubbing her big belly saying to her baby "I couldn't  give you up to somebody I didn't know".&#160; I thought to myself 'but you had no  problem having the abortionist cut your baby up in many pieces &amp; be thrown  in the fire'.&#160; Oh my Lord this is so messed up.&#160;Then I saw that the test was  negative &amp; told her so.&#160; Then she said to me that she had a pregnancy test  before &amp; it was negative &amp; she was pregnant &amp; had an abortion at 5  months.&#160; I almost threw up &amp;&#160;I couldn't think anymore.&#160; I thought that I was  in a very bad dream.&#160; But I woke up &amp; went to the shelves to get the post  abortion information for them.&#160; I also went &amp; got two DVD's to put into the  Truth packet.&#160; She said that she was on Implanon birth control (surgically put  in to your arm) &amp; now had it taken out.&#160; I said that a young girl yesterday  said that it caused her to have a blood clot &amp; she had it removed too.&#160; I  gave her a brochure&#160; to inform her of the Side Effects. &#160;</font></strong></span></span></div><div align="center"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS; COLOR: black;

I went into the  office I got her the list of the other pregnancy centers in the area &amp; said  for her to call them for more clothes for her baby.&#160; She said "thank you".&#160; The  man who was her Uncle said "thank you for these books, it'll sure help&#160;me  because there isn't any father interaction".&#160;

He said "no it was the older Planned Parenthood escort that was in  the ambulance".&#160; I remember telling her a couple of months ago that I hope that  she doesn't die a sudden death like a Heart Attack or a Stroke because she  wasn't ready.

I said that we don't do that at  Focus &amp; he would have to come &amp; get them or ask a family member or a  friend to.&#160; I said "good bye" &amp; hung up &amp; went into the center.&#160; Then  the cell phone rang again.&#160; It was my sister Carolyn saying that her daughter  was in the hospital with contractions.&#160; She's 6 week before her daughter is due  to be born.&#160; She was dehydrated &amp; had IV's going.&#160; The doctor told her not  to smoke anymore &amp; stop drinking soda.&#160;Thank God.&#160; I pray that she &amp; her  precious baby girl will be okay.&#160; I finally got back outside to the front lines  &amp; witnessed near Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was looking for the young girl that  I was told had a 1pm appointment for an abortion but I didn't notice anyone  coming into the parking lot except the works coming back from lunch.&#160; Thank  God!!&#160; It was about 1:10pm when a car with two people stopped by where I was  standing.&#160; It was Mike &amp; another pro lifer.&#160; He asked where to park &amp; I  told him in the parking lot by the center.&#160; A few minutes later he walked up the  sidewalk with the other pro lifer &amp; his long time life pro life partner  Jerry.&#160; I was so thankful to God to see them &amp; have them take over so that  Martha &amp; I could be in the center, for no one was there.&#160; Kathryn was&#160;still  sick &amp; Paul was with Valerie helping her out.&#160; I asked&#160;Mike if he would pass  out our Truth packets &amp; he said that he would.&#160;

I was so happy to hear that.&#160;  After he left I was told how good he was on the front lines speaking &amp;  dealing with the people that stopped to talk with him.&#160; Also, one of the woman  workers at Planned Parenthood came out &amp; got into his face asking who he  was.&#160; And I was told he had a very graphic sign that he had brought with him  that effected many people that saw it.&#160; That's what we want.&#160; Great job Mike  &amp;

Father of  mercies,<br />
God of all creation,<br />
Source of life and of every blessing,<br />
We  thank you today, and every day of our lives, <br />
For all that you give  us!<br /><br />
Our thanksgiving is not only a duty,<br />
But a joy and a source of  strength,<br />
Because it reminds us of your faithful love,<br />
And inspires us  with the hope of a future filled with blessings!<br /><br />
Lord, we thank you for  guiding our fathers,<br />
Who, inspired by the prophets<br />
And by the saving work  of your Son,<br />
Founded a nation where all might live as one,<br />
Acknowledging  their dependence on you<br />
As the source of their right to life.<br /><br />
We thank  you for your blessings in the past,<br />
And for all that, with your help, we must  yet achieve.<br /><br />
We ask you to bless us as we thank you,<br />
That our giving  thanks may be accompanied by our firm resolve<br />
To proclaim, celebrate, and  serve<br />
The gift of human life, born and unborn.<br /><br />
We pray through Christ  our Lord. Amen.<br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;</div><div style="text-align: center;">&#160;</div><hr /><div style="text-align: center;"><div align="center">&#160;</div><div align="center">&#160;</div><div align="center"><u><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" id="TitleLabel">'Staying  Faithful</span></span></span></span></em></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> '<br /><br /><span id="SPAN2"><span id="TextLabel">Lord, thank you for your faithfulness to your promises throughout  the generations.

I knew that there would be enough people,  out on the sidewalk today, to witness &amp; to inform the people going into the  Killing Mill about abortion &amp; not to do it.&#160; When I went into the center I  started to get to work right away for there was many clients waiting at the  door.&#160; I lead them in &amp; asked then to print their name on the rooster in the  fist Material Aid Room.&#160; I went on to open up all the rooms to get ready for the  afternoon.&#160; It was about 1:10 pm that Martha came into the center &amp; a few  minutes later Kathryn came in to help us.&#160; She started to answer the door &amp;  to help out our many clients that came in for 'free' clothes &amp; some food  &amp; diapers.&#160; </span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha was doing a pregnancy test, in the Rose Room,&#160;&amp;

My heart  dropped.&#160; I said "we will help you so that you can help her".&#160; I&#160;said "thank you  Kathy" &amp; she went back outside to pray &amp; to witness some more.&#160; I  brought him into the Rose Room &amp; we talked.&#160; I asked him his name again  &amp; he said "Andrew".&#160; I went over to the stand to get the Truth packet &amp;  filled it up some more&#160;helpful&#160;brochures.&#160; I also gave him three DVD's even the  newest one that shows&#160;how abortions are done in all three trimesters&#160;&amp; the  award winning movie 'Bella', he said that he would watch it.&#160; I asked him what  his girlfriends name was &amp; he said "Maria".&#160;&#160;He then said that she wanted  his baby out of her.&#160; How horrible, to hear this from his so called girlfriend.&#160;  I said that if she does have an abortion for him never to see her again &amp; he  would have to forgive her too (that takes time &amp; strength from God).&#160; I  asked if he had a Bible &amp; he said that he has read the whole Bible, so  I&#160;suggested that he&#160;continues to read the Bible passages every day for wisdom  &amp; strength.&#160; I then said to him "hopefully she will change her mind &amp;  when she does you come back here to tell me the great news".&#160; &#160;He smiled at me  then I prayed with him for a few minutes &amp;

then started talking to her too.&#160;  She had hust seen her attorney &amp; it looks good for a conviction.&#160; She's  soooo&#160;angry at the abortionist &amp; soooo hurt by what he did&#160;to her baby &amp;  to her.&#160; After Pat &amp; she left I approached Mike &amp; said that I was told  by Mike V. that there was some commotion by the neighbor Jim Martin, who lives  across the street, from Planned Parenthood.&#160; He said that the mega phone was to  loud &amp; started to threat that he would call the police, which he didn't do.&#160;  Mike &amp; Jerry have been on the front lines, in front of abortion mills, for  years &amp; through the grace of God know how to handle the problems &amp;  the attacks that come their way.....great.&#160; <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">They</span></span> will handle Jim Martin.&#160;

Edison couldn't stay for  supper, for he had a meeting to go to tonight, I was disappointed.&#160; We all put  our coats on &amp; went over to the Banquet Room, with food in our hands.&#160; The  room was so cold, that no one took their coats off,&#160;but ate a delicious  supper.&#160;&#160;I will speak to our landlord, as soon as possible about this, so it  won't happen again next month.&#160; </span></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><font size="2" face="Arial"> <hr /><div align="left"><div align="center"><u><em><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span id="TitleLabel" style="font-weight: bold;">Rejoice, O  Israel!</span></span></span></span></em></u><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"> <br /><br /><span id="SPAN2"><span id="TextLabel">Lord Jesus, you came into the world to set us free from the forces  of evil both within our souls and from the culture in which we live.

on about being judgmental but she talked with her Physiologist this  morning about yesterday.&#160; Oh no Shy, just talk about you &amp; how to recover  from what Wortman did to you &amp; your precious baby.&#160;

let God take care of it.&#160;  Pat said to me that she told her to leave the wrapped up doll in the car today.&#160;  How people handle trauma &amp; grief is a personal experience.&#160; I pray for her  recovery &amp;

I lead her to the  Rose Room &amp; asked her to fill out an Intake Sheet &amp; she did.&#160; I gave her  the cup &amp; lead her to the bathroom.&#160; When she came back to the Rose Room I  showed her how to do the pregnancy test.&#160; I then said that we have to wait 5  minutes &amp; we can talk. I asked her about her life &amp; how it was going.&#160; I  then looked down at the test &amp; said to her matter of fact saying "you are  pregnant".&#160; She gave me a big smile &amp; then said that she was quite warm  &amp; asked for some water.&#160; I got up &amp; went to my office &amp; got her a  bottle of water from the mini refrig.&#160; She was thankful &amp; so was I that she  was happy to be having a precious baby.&#160; I did say to her that she, like so many  others, are doing things a little bit mixed up, for God wants us to Marry first  then have sex &amp; then have the baby.&#160; She said "I know &amp; I have asked God  to forgive me".&#160; She said that she was going to marry the father of her two  children, one who is 2 years old &amp; the other child in her womb.&#160; She said  that she loves him &amp; he is a good man but she's scared.&#160; I went to the  literature counter &amp; got two brochures on marriage &amp; handed them to  her.&#160; She smiled at me &amp; said "thank you".&#160; I said "you are more then  welcome".&#160; She also told me that she went to Planned Parenthood first &amp; they  told her that they don't do walk in pregnancy tests.&#160; As she was walking down  the street she saw our A-Frame sign saying that we do 'free pregnancy tests'  &amp; came on into Focus.&#160; She had a pink paper in her hands &amp; she handed it  to me &amp; I threw it out &amp; went on&#160;to call Embracing Options to make an  appointment for an ultrasound test for Wednesday, January 8th. at 1:30pm.&#160; She  was thrilled &amp; then left.&#160; As I was cleaning up in the Rose Room I went over  to the trash can &amp; took out&#160;the pink paper &amp; opened it so see that she  had an appointment for a pregnancy test for Wednesday, January 8th. at 1:30pm  but she won't be there, at Planned Parenthood, for she will be seeing her  precious little baby, in her womb &amp; hearing the baby's heartbeat, at that  time at His Branches:)&#160; Praise God!!!</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Scotty came today &amp; surprised us with a large  pizza with mushrooms &amp; pepperoni.&#160; It was delicious!&#160; Then Lisa, Martha's  daughter, came to help us out.&#160; It was a busy place today as usual.&#160; Kathryn will  be back next Thursday.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang again &amp; in came Elizabeth, I  was so happy to see her, <span style="font-size: medium;">f<font face="Arial">or</font></span> she was in Las Vegas last week, with friends.&#160; She came earlier today&#160;&amp; that was great.&#160; She meet  both Lisa's, who were on their way out.&#160; Martha asked her if she wanted supper  but she said "no".&#160; So after supper Martha left, for her daughter &amp; her family  were coming in from Pennsylvania on Friday, so she had a lot to do at home.&#160; I  said "good bye &amp; I'll see you next week Martha".&#160; Off she went but as she  was walking out the door David came in to help us.&#160; So it was Elizabeth &amp;  Scotty &amp; David with me now.&#160; Scotty, who is visually impaired, was walking  around talking to us &amp; Elizabeth &amp; David were putting the rest of the  donations away in the two Material Aid Rooms.
