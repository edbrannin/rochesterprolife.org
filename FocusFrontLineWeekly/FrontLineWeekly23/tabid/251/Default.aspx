I saw Pat walking towards Focus.&#160; I  haven't seen her in awhile so I was happy to see her today even though it was  busy.&#160; I greeted her as she came in &amp; we went to the All Purpose Room down  the hall so we could talk.&#160; She went &amp; sat on the sofa &amp; I at the table,  in the center of the room.&#160; She began saying that she had many battles to fight  &amp; started with the first one at Head Start.&#160; She said that it was completed  &amp; then onto the other on which wasn't yet.&#160; Her granddaughter is being  harassed by the lesbian girls in the locker after GYM class &amp; she's tired of  it so she want's to quit school &amp; go to GED classes instead.&#160; I told Pat  that she has three more months to go &amp; for her to hang in there.&#160; What she  does is her business.&#160; I certainly don't want anything to happen to Arrianna.&#160;  As she was telling me of the third problem the doorbell rang so I got up to get  it.&#160; There at the door was the saleswoman from Buffalo.&#160; She came because she's  selling water coolers.&#160; I knew that it would be difficult with two women in the  room but I will persevere.&#160; She sat down at the table across from me &amp;  started her talk.&#160; Then she looked&#160;at the Great Room &amp; I said that this room  is where we have Mass.&#160; Then she said that she was Catholic then the she went on  to say that her husband had been married before &amp; they were married in the  Protestant church.&#160; I asked if he was married in the Catholic Church with his  first marriage &amp; she said "yes".&#160; She said that she still goes to Mass every  Sunday.&#160; I asked if she receives Holy Communion &amp; she said "yes".&#160; My heart  was in shock &amp; I quickly replied that she should not receive Holy Communion  until there is an Annulment for his fist marriage &amp; a blessing for their  marriage.&#160; She said that they were married for 28 years &amp; I said that don't  matter &amp; asked her to go talk with a Priest in Buffalo as son as she could  &amp; in the meantime continue to go to Mass but DO NOT receive Holy Communion  for you're putting hot coals on your heard because this is serious.&#160; She said  that she isn't going to ask her husband to get an Annulment for he has had  children &amp; his wife as re married &amp; not going to church.&#160; Please I said  again go talk to a Priest.&#160; The doorbell rang again so I got up to answer it.&#160;  It was our regular client of two sets of twins &amp; another child &amp; she's  pregnant.&#160; I asked her how she was doing &amp; keeping her head down said "all  right".&#160; I then went back down the hall &amp; Pat was talking about the sexual  abuse of Priests.&#160; I said "why are you talking about this"?&#160; Pat said that she  has the Freedom of Speech &amp; I said "not here".&#160; I went on to say that it is<u>serious</u> but remember that less than 1% committed this crime.&#160; It was so  inappropriate to talk about this at this time. &#160;I almost fainted for I'm trying  to save a soul here.&#160; She went on now to talk about the water system &amp; I was  about to say "yes" when she added that I would have to make a commitment of 5  years.&#160; I said this changes my decision.&#160; Before she left she said that she  would call me next week to see what I finally decided.&#160; We said "good bye" &amp;  she left.&#160; I went back to talk to Pat.&#160; I was upset with her so I said what I  said &amp; then she continued on with what was going on in her life.&#160; I gave her  diapers for her great grandchildren &amp; we said "good bye" &amp; I gave her a  hug.&#160; She is a special women &amp; I can't stay mad at her.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I went to the office to check my emails &amp;

After Mass &amp; drove to Focus &amp; was  greeted by a young girl.&#160; I asked her to give me a few minutes to open up &amp;  she did.&#160; I then asked her what I could do for her &amp; she said that she  wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I said "okay" &amp; lead her to the Rose Room to fill  out the Intake Sheet.&#160; She did the pregnancy test &amp; it was negative but I  noticed that she had had an abortion in her past so I directed my questions to  that &amp; I gave her appropriate brochures for&#160;her post abortion.&#160; She said  that she like to read.&#160; She said that Planned Parenthood suggested us to her  &amp; thank God for I needed to talk to her today.&#160; While this was going on the  doorbell kept on ringing, so I apologized for this.&#160; I asked Infiniti, our  regular client, to assist me &amp; she did so gracefully.&#160; She told me that  another girl wanted a pregnancy test, who was sitting on the sofa, so after the  first test I approached her &amp; brought her into the Rose Room to fill out the  Intake Sheet.&#160; The doorbell kept on ringing.&#160; As I was waiting for our client to  return to the Rose Room after giving me a specimen I saw that Agnes had brought  in the Friars &amp; sister into the center.&#160; I quickly greeted them &amp; then  went back to the Rose Room to continue the pregnancy test which as positive.&#160;  She was post abortive twice so I spoke to her about this &amp; then I asked her  if she wanted a 'free' ultrasound test &amp; she said "yes", so I called  Embracing Options &amp; scheduled a test for tomorrow, with Barbara.&#160; She was  happy &amp; the left Focus with her many brochures.&#160; She also said that she  liked to read so I gave her many pamphlets.&#160; She came to Focus&#160; through  Christine who was out on the sidewalk praying &amp; when this young girl came  out of Planned Parenthood she directed her to Focus for a pregnancy  test......thank you Christine!!!!</span></strong></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div align="left"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I was blessed in meeting the Friars that  Agnes brought into Focus alone g with a sweet nun.&#160;

I was impressed &amp; thankful.&#160; I went  in to the first Material Aid Room to help someone &amp; when I came out I heard  the sweet voices of everyone singing 'Happy Birthday' to me, I almost cried.&#160;  The one Friar came up to me &amp; said d that he has&#160;Crohn's disease so he knows  abdominal pain.&#160; I said that I gave had a ripping in my gut all my life.&#160; He  said that he had a healing &amp; that he will pray that I receive one too.&#160; I  was so touched by his kindness &amp; thankful to him.&#160; His name is Friar V.&#160; God  bless you all &amp; you to Agnes, for I was delighted by you presence:)&#160; We all  hugged as they left &amp; Infiniti also was give a hug by everyone.&#160; She also  gave them a tour of Focus while I was doing&#160;the pregnancy test &amp; told them  about her child, who was almost aborted...&#160;

A  week later, Jesus appeared once more to the disciples gathered in the Upper  Room, and Thomas was present; Jesus turned to him and told him to touch his  wounds.

They are<em>&#160;essential for believing in God</em>. Not for believing that God  exists, but for believing that&#160;<em>God is love, mercy and faithfulness</em>.  Saint Peter, quoting Isaiah, writes to Christians: "by his wounds you have been  healed" (<em>1 Pet</em>&#160;2:24, cf.&#160;<em>Is</em>&#160;53:5).</strong></font></span>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font color="#555555"><strong>Saint John XXIII and Saint John Paul  II&#160;<em>were not afraid to look upon the wounds of Jesus, to touch his torn hands  and his pierced side</em>. They were not ashamed of the flesh of Christ, they  were not scandalized by him, by his cross; they did not despise the flesh of  their brother (cf.&#160;<em>Is&#160;</em>58:7), because they saw Jesus in every person who  suffers and struggles. These were two men of courage, filled with  the&#160;<em>parrhesia</em>&#160;of the Holy Spirit, and they bore witness before the  Church and the world to God’s goodness and mercy.</strong></font></span>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font color="#555555"><strong>They were priests, bishops and popes  of the twentieth century. They lived through the tragic events of that century,  but they were not overwhelmed by them.

I called our client &amp; she said that she didn’t do it.&#160; So I told  the landlord&#160; left it alone.&#160; No police were called.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div style="text-align: left;"><div align="center">&#160;</div><u><div align="center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br type="_moz" /></span></span></span></div></u><div align="center"><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><font new=""><span id="TitleLabel"><font style="size: +0"><strong><font style="size: +0"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 16.5pt">Heralds of the  Gospel</font></font></strong></font></span>&#160;</font></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /><br /><strong><span id="SPAN2">We are all  invited to walk the streets of the world with our brothers and sisters,  proclaiming and witnessing to our faith in Christ and making ourselves heralds  of his Gospel. –Pope Francis</span></strong></span></span></span><font new=""> </font></div><div align="center">&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thursday, May 1, 2014 at Focus</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">When I arrived at Focus Martha was already there, for she had been out on  the sidewalk, praying this morning.&#160;
