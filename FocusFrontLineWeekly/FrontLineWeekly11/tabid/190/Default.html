Paul, had bought us lunch at Wendy's again. I will be turn into an hamburger real soon.&#160; How nice of you Paul &amp; thank you for the hamburger &amp; French fries it sure hit the spot before I was to go on the front lines.&#160; Martha, Paul &amp; I brought out the literature box &amp; the signs to the front lines today.&#160; I was just about to join Martha &amp; Paul outside when a client came in for a pregnancy test so I stayed to do that. I spoke to her about abstinence &amp; chastity.&#160; She was receptive to me because I was telling her the Truth.&#160; You really can't come against the Truth.&#160; She was convicted by the grace of God &amp; will not have sex until she marries her fiancé, later this year.&#160; Praise God!&#160; He grandmother said the very same thing.&#160; Thank you dear Grandma!&#160; We said "good by" after I showed her the Material Aid Room for after she marries.&#160; She was happy to see that she would receive assistance, after she marries &amp; gets then gets pregnant.</span></span></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">&#160;I was on the front lines with Paul.&#160;&#160;Martha was in the center, putting away children clothes &amp; doing other things, in getting ready for the Mass tomorrow at Focus.&#160; A young woman walked up the sidewalk&#160; &amp; as she passed by me I asked her if she would like a packet of information.&#160; She said that she has one already &amp; I asked her if she had read it.&#160; She said "some of it".&#160; I asked her if she was going into Planned Parenthood &amp; she said "yes but not for an abortion".&#160; I asked "for what then"?&#160; She said that she was going in for birth control.&#160; I said that&#160;birth control&#160;wasn't good for her &amp; did she read what the brochures said about&#160;the different kinds of birth control,&#160;in the packet that&#160;she received?&#160; She then said that her family wants her on birth control because she's going to go to college.&#160; They wanted&#160;her on it 'just in case'.&#160; "What", I said "are you kidding".&#160;&#160; I said "you can keep yourself chaste by not being alone with the boy by&#160;making sure that other people are around you &amp; also&#160;by not&#160;taking off your clothes or not getting drunk,&#160; Let&#160;him&#160;get to know you&#160;by dating you, for possible marriage.&#160; He will respect you &amp; you will respect yourself too.&#160; It can happen.&#160; You also need to pray for strength &amp; to come against temptation.&#160; God will give you the graces that you will need to be abstinent &amp; chaste.&#160; Just then a car drove up, by the sidewalk, to let a young girl out.&#160; I said to her "I hope that you're not going into Planned Parenthood".&#160; The mother in the car screamed "yes she is she's going in for the shot".&#160; I said that the shot can cause bone fractures, for it pulls the calcium out of the bones &amp; can cause osteoporosis, a thinning of the bones &amp; she can have a broken arm or leg at any time because of it &amp; besides it can cause early abortions.&#160; I had to spit this out in matter of less then a minute.&#160; The mother flagged the girl to keep on going as I was making the sign of the cross.&#160; The mother screamed at me "are you a Christian"?&#160; I said "yes but you're not", you don't care".&#160; She hollered back to me "what did you say about me not caring".&#160; I didn't want this to become a fight, I figured I said all I could say to this woman who was not receptive of the Truth &amp; just wanted to scream &amp; not to talk &amp; get the information that she &amp; her precious daughter needed.&#160; As I was dealing with this situation I noticed that the young girl that I was talking to went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I hope that she realizes someday soon what she will be doing to her body &amp; her soul by using birth control.&#160; What a misguided family she has, like most.&#160; I now walked towards the fence &amp; just let the mother who wanted to fight, fight with herself.&#160; When her daughter starts to have all sorts of womanly problems maybe then she will realize what I was trying to do that day to prevent that from happening.&#160; This poor daughter to have mother like that!&#160; Maybe she felt she was ding good by her daughter, only God can judge her heart, I was just judging her actions.&#160; Because she was so angry I felt that she knew, deep down inside, it&#160;was wrong &amp; was being convicted by the Holy Spirit.</span></span></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">Melissa, the Death Escort&#160;at Planned Paretnthood, is pregnant.&#160; She looked terrible though, as she walked passed Martha &amp; I on the sidewalk, to get to Planned Parenthood, to put on her blue apron to greet &amp; deceive the girls going into this Killing Mill.&#160; It made me so sad to see her there again &amp; now bring her precious baby, in her womb, there too.&#160; I told her that she was now 'pro life', because she was pregnant.&#160; These girls determine when they want to have a baby.&#160; If they don't want one then they have the baby killed but&#160;if they do want one then they let the baby live.&#160; It's all about them &amp; their 'choice'.&#160; How sad.&#160; I was very happy that she 'chose life' for this precious baby for she didn't with her first baby.&#160; She even held a sign once on the sidewalk that read "I don't regret my abortion".&#160; How bad was that!&#160; Hours later as she was leaving Planned Parenthood, Martha offered her baby clothes at the center&#160;after she delivers her baby, but she&#160;just walked by us to go home&#160;&amp; she just looked straight ahead with no emotion.&#160;&#160;We are praying for you dear Melissa, we are here for you.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that this little baby will change&#160;your life, through the grace of God, &amp;&#160;you will&#160;have a 'new beginning', with&#160;your sweet&#160;baby.&#160;&#160;&#160;Where there is Prayer there is Hope.</span></span></strong></span></p><hr /><p><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Wednesday, May 11, 2011 at Focus for our first Mass of 2011</strong></span></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">This was the day we were having our Mass at Focus.&#160; So much to do when we are having a Mass.&#160; I was in the center but decided to go out to the front lines for a minute &amp; there come out a young girl who was receptive to learning the Truth about the Depo shot.&#160; She was invited to follow me to the Focus Center &amp; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; told her about the what the Depo shot will do to her &amp; her unborn baby.&#160; I showed her around &amp; she looked at the pictures on the wall that showed the Truth about what abortion looks like.&#160; I then brought her into the Material Aid Room where she picked out a couple of dresses for her little sister.&#160; I showed her a kitty stuffed animal &amp; I said "why don't you give this to your little sister".&#160; She said "wow" &amp; took it.&#160; I asked if she would like a bag to put it in &amp; she said that she wanted to hold it.&#160; I think that it is hers &amp; not her little sisters.&#160; I told her to be careful that no one steals it on the bus, hold it tight.&#160; I told her that if she needed us for anything please just call &amp; please read the literature packet &amp; don't go back to Planned Parenthood for another Depo Provera shot that can cause bone fractures &amp; acts as an abortificant, an early abortion.&#160; I also stressed abstinence &amp; gave her literature &amp; a CD on that.&#160; So was a very sweet &amp; my heart breaks that Planned Parenthood makes victims of these girls &amp; ruin their lives , bodies &amp; souls.&#160; Planned Parenthood&#160;kills babies &amp;&#160;the women's spirit!!!!!&#160; Evil................</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">After she left the center&#160;I decided to stay to get some work done in the office &amp;

get the food ready that was already purchased.&#160; Pat brought two pizza's &amp; the food came as the people came to attend the Mass.&#160; Father Bill Amann arrived &amp; he was a complete delight, what a great Priest, so loving &amp;&#160;pleasant.&#160; The people started to arrive.&#160; Colleen came, who I haven't seen in awhile. &#160;I was so glad.&#160; She&#160; brought me a decoupage that she had made &amp; a check from the Finger Lakes Pregnancy Center.&#160;Colleen &amp; I&#160;have a bond because we did the protest when Rachael Phelps, the abortionist at Planned Parenthood, received the 40 under 40 recognition by the Rochester Business Journal.&#160; She even spoke to Mayor Duffy at that time &amp; she told him that an abortionist was receiving an award today.&#160; He looked puzzled, she told me later, for I was on the other side of the hotel protest.&#160; After the Mass we had David give his testimony that his mother tried to abort him but wasn't successful, thank God!!!&#160; For he is alive &amp; well by the power of God.&#160;&#160; also gave my testimony about my Grandmother's aborting my Aunt in 1920 at Johns Hopkins Hospital &amp; my grandfather didn't know about it, until he was on his death bed.&#160; She was going to repeat another abortion, 2 1/2 years later,&#160;which would have been my mother, to which I or any other member of my family would not be here on Earth.&#160; How very sad that she would have done this.&#160; Lord have Mercy on her soul!!&#160; Also, Pat our grandmother &amp; great grandmother was at the Mass &amp; she gave her testimony after mine.&#160; Grandbaby # 4 is on the way, expected to be born in June, another girl!&#160;&#160;We at Focus love this family&#160;&amp;

The first man and woman were getting information about PP for a friend. I urged them to steer her away from this evil place, and gave them a packet and DVD. The next car to stop took a packet too. The man (who was driving) was receptive.&#160; The girl was in a hurry to get away.&#160; The third car held two women, and a child in the back. One of them had been to PP for a check up. They also took a packet and promised to pray. They were pro life, so I asked them to especially look at the pamphlets about birth control.</span></span></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="color: #000000">The next encounter was heartbreaking. A man and woman came out of PP toward their car. It was obvious they were in anguish. They stopped and comforted each other. She had just killed her baby. “Oh nooooo….I am soooo sorry!!!”, I called out to them, saying how sorry I was. What had been done could not be undone, but I urged them to come and talk to me, since I am not allowed to go into the parking lot. I had information that would help them deal with the sorrow and guilt.&#160; They did come out. I said I wished they had come to talk to us on the way in. There are plenty of options, and we at Focus could have helped.&#160; The man was the father. I gave him a packet I took out the rubberized baby, showing it to him and saying that it would be too upsetting for her today. I asked him to look at the packet, and give her what he thought she could handle today, and save the rest for later. I pointed out Project Rachel as a wonderful agency to help with healing.<br />
They promised to urge any friends who might get pregnant to stay away from PP, and to come to us at&#160; Focus for help. I briefly touched on abstinence until marriage also. This couple was quite receptive to the information&#160; we gave them. I wrote their&#160; names down, getting the correct spelling from them, and said I&#160; would keep them in&#160; my prayers, and asked them to pray for us too.</span></span></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="color: #000000">A young lady who walks by often gave us encouragement.

Paul were on the sidewalk praying &amp; counseling.&#160; I was wondering where the other two men were &amp; I later found out that they had brought a friend to the hospital.&#160; I got to speak to Sheila briefly to hear such a sad story that happened on her time in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; It was painful to hear her tell me, though I know that she must.&#160; I wanted to get the sidewalk set up with the signs &amp; the literature box because I expected the photographer from the Town Newspapers to be there to take our pictures.&#160; I was interviewed via telephone earlier this week regarding my pro life experiences over the past 26 years as a pro life activist.&#160; I was hoping that Martha would show up in time to have her picture taken but she came after he had just left.&#160; I was disappointed.&#160; When I &amp; Paul were bringing out the graphic &amp; non-graphic signs there was the reporter.&#160; I introduced myself to him &amp; he said that he had arrived a little early.&#160; I said that was okay,&#160;so he walked about taking our pictures.&#160; There was Bill, across the street sitting on his stool holding&#160;the graphic&#160;sign of Malachi, the aborted baby that was found in a dumpster many years ago, at an abortion mill.&#160; I told him that Bill was a Korean vet so he went over across the street to take his picture.&#160; As the photographer was taking our pictures Rick Bartell, the Public Relations man from Planned Parenthood, came out onto the sidewalk looking around.&#160; Just wait when this article comes out in all the Town Newspapers bad mouthing Planned Parenthood.&#160; He took all of our pictures &amp; asked our names.&#160; Adolf had showed up so he was included in the pictures &amp; before Sheila left he had taken her picture&#160;too &amp; asked me what her name was.&#160; So we'll see how this pans out with the article &amp; the pictures of us on the front lines.&#160; I hope that they do us well to get this very important message out about how horrible abortion is.&#160;

I think that they heard me for when they came out about 45 minutes later the one girl had the packet &amp; the other two girls asked for one each.&#160; I asked if they were friends or sisters &amp; they said that they were sisters.&#160; So I gave them a DVD for educational purposes.&#160; They opposed abortion &amp; were upset with what they saw on the graphic signs, &amp; said that they were at Planned Parenthood for condoms.&#160; I doubted that because they were in there for so long &amp; to get condoms it only takes a minute or so.&#160; I was so&#160;happy that they were receptive to receive the additional packets, to help change their young lives.&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="color: #000000">&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><strong><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="color: #000000">A mother was walking by us to go get her other son at the school at the corner up the street.&#160;

Martha &amp; I said "thank you" &amp; off he went to the restaurant, 2 doors down from us,&#160;to see if there were any leaks in there.&#160; Icky for a restaurant to have so much water damage.&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">Just then the office phone rang &amp;

to counsel.&#160; About 20 minutes later Sandy came walking in.&#160; She had changed her mind &amp; came after all to help us, which she did.&#160; She put clothes away &amp; diapers that I had just bought at the Dollar General for our moms children.&#160; Martha &amp; I finally got out onto the front lines &amp; he was raining lightly.&#160; So I had to go back to my car to get an umbrella for the gray rainy day that was ours today.&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">&#160;</span></span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="color: #000000">We got the usual finger people that are so sad to&#160;my spirit, for I know what lies ahead of them in years to come if they make it at all.&#160;

the man turned around at me &amp; said "I'm going to have an abortion &amp; put his hands on his stomach".&#160; What was that all about.&#160; Later when they came out I asked Martha to talk to them for I was disturbed with what the man had said to me earlier.&#160; They asked to go into the center to receive some clothes for their child which Martha brought them into the center to service them with baby clothes for their lovely baby in the stroller.&#160; Later on Martha told me that they told he that they didn't believe in abortion.&#160;

I was feeling weak.&#160; She said "sure" &amp; I asked her if she would be all right until I get back &amp; she said "yes".&#160; So I went back into the center to make myself a quick sandwich.&#160; Well I was wrong about it being 'quick'.&#160; I had just made my sandwich &amp; had taken at least two bites when I saw a man coming in to the All Purpose Room.&#160; He said to me "my name is Angel do you remember me about 6 months ago when I needed&#160; a bus ticket you helped me".&#160; I said that I had called the church that had given you a check &amp; they said that you could have gotten a ticket with that.&#160; He said that he didn't have any ID so they wouldn't take it.&#160; He now said that his mother had just died yesterday &amp; he needed a ticket, one way, to go to Buffalo to be with his family.&#160; He also said that her tried many places but they wouldn't give him any money for the trip back home for the funeral.&#160; I thought about it &amp; decided to give him the needed $20 lets say ' to take a chance that he was telling me the truth'.&#160; I went into the office to get the money &amp; the form for him to fill out, which he did &amp; I told him that if this was a scam that he would have to answer to God for it, not me.&#160; He said&#160;"no it's not a scam &amp; then took out his wallet to show me his child".&#160; "Very nice"&#160; I said, &amp; the very best to you during this very difficult time.&#160; I think that he almost cried.&#160; If this was another scam, for this is his second time that he's been to us at Focus for help,&#160;only God knows, but I would say if it was he is really convincing.&#160;

There were people that I knew from Rochester &amp; a couple that are donators for Focus were at our table with her daughter &amp; her boyfriend which she met on CatholicMatch.com.&#160; I might consider in looking at this sight.&#160; He was real nice &amp; so was she, so I expect Wedding Bells to be announced very soon for this nice couple.&#160; I also saw two ladies that orientated with Martha &amp; I on the front lines during the 40 Days for Life last Fall.&#160; They are fighting Planned Parenthood where they live in Dansville. Martha was busy with the Silent Auction tickets to see if possible s he could win something, which she didn't nor did I.&#160; The conversation was terrific &amp; the food was delicious.&#160; After supper Abby went to the podium to start speaking which comes naturally to her.&#160;

How sick it seems to her now.&#160; She spoke so much on how the evil Planned Parenthood works to increase their abortion numbers &amp; other deceptions there too.&#160; After her talk she received a standing ovation.&#160;

I asked if they were kidding me or were serious. They became serious. They don’t believe in God, so we mostly spoke about lost parenthood, and a baby that will never have the chance to grow up. I told them I had been agnostic when I was younger, and my effort to pray for someone who asked me to, even though I was in doubt, showed me that God DOES exist, because I saw Him working in my life.

I was so upset to see this. As he was driving away I heard a voice from a guy on a bike riding down the street saying “you bank, blank, why don’t you mind your own business you blank, blank. A car almost hit him as he was severing back &amp; forth on the street. I was so afraid that he was going to get killed.

Thank you so much.&#160;Baby girl Ariel was born on February 23rd. at 8lbs. 4ozs..&#160; Mom &amp; baby are doing well.&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I came back out to the front lines again &amp; Martha told me that she thought that a little girl was by herself in the car.&#160; Later on I knew that she was right.&#160; Adolf had gone home &amp; Martha was back in the center helping a client.&#160; I saw that a woman had come out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walked over to the car with the man &amp; young child in the car.&#160; I hollered over to them that the child in the car will be greatly affected when she finds out someday that you had her brother or sister killed here today.&#160; I also said "how can you love one child &amp; kill the other".&#160; When they pulled out of the driveway I looked at them both &amp; said "I hope &amp; pray that you didn't have her baby killed here today if so repent of the sin of murder".&#160; The male driver threw out the window, at me,&#160;his plastic bottle of water &amp; then I knew for sure that she did have an abortion here today.&#160;My heart ached for the little girl in the back seat of the car never growing up with her brother or sister &amp; finding out someday that her parents had brought her to the place where they had he or she killed, let alone had left her all by herself in the car, when the father went into Planned Parenthood to see how his wife was doing in the killing of their child !!!&#160; You think it can't get any worse!!&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Martha came back out to be with me once more &amp; a car pulled into the parking lot &amp; parked near the fence.&#160; I called over to the man &amp; woman &amp; pleaded with them not to have their baby killed that there was help for them in the community &amp; that their baby had an heart beat after 18 days after conception &amp; that abortion stops a beating heart.&#160; He thought I was funny.&#160; I don't think so sir.&#160; I think that you are in the wrong place with your girlfriend &amp; maybe was about to do the worst thing thing that you could possibly do to another human being &amp; that it to have them killed.&#160; What's so funny in trying to save a life sir???&#160; I took the mega phone &amp; the prayer card "My Life Depends on You" over to the brick side of the building to say the poem out loud for those who were in there could here me &amp; be touched by the words of the poem &amp; turn away from having their baby be killed.&#160; As I was crossing the street to come back over to be with Martha on the bush side of the sidewalk a car was coming out of the parking lot &amp; the male driver gave me a demonic look like he just had come from the pit of&#160;hell or was heading back&#160;there to the 'Lake of Fire'.&#160; I must admit it was a terrifying look to scare me which it did send chills up my spine.&#160; That's the look of someone who just killed their child, a sacrifice to Satan.&#160; Lord have Mercy on him &amp; her &amp; all of them today &amp; everyday that they kill your children, at Planned Parenthood.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium">A young girl was walking passed Martha &amp; I &amp; we started to speak to her.&#160; We offered her a Truth packet &amp; she told us that she had an appointment at Planned Parenthood to get a STD test.&#160; I knew that this might be false because the young man, about&#160;30 minutes earlier, came out after wanting a STD test &amp; because they're killing babies in there all day today, he was told to leave.&#160; She said to us "I'm not doing anything wrong I'm just getting a STD test, I'm engaged &amp; I want the test".&#160; I said that I would call Compass Care that give out STD test for free &amp; they are good people that protect life.&#160; She said "okay", so I called.&#160; I received a long phone message &amp; then left a message for someone to call me ASAP &amp; hung up.&#160; We tried to talk to her so that she felt comfortable while we were waiting for the call back.&#160; It seemed to take to long so I called Back &amp; got a person.&#160; As I was talking to her on the phone I saw that our young lady was walking into the Planned Parenthood.&#160; My heart sank &amp; I told the woman on the phone that the client went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said "thank you" &amp; hung up.&#160; I felt so sad &amp; frustrated.&#160; What a horrible day of death &amp; victims.&#160; A few minutes later the young lady came out &amp; told Martha &amp; I that she went into Planned Parenthood to cancel the appointment?&#160; Okay so I called Compass Care again &amp; got the same woman on the phone &amp;after I told her why we were calling I handed my phone to the young lady to speak to the woman to make an appointment.&#160; After the call I was handed back my phone &amp; she walked into the center to receive clothes for her two children at home, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; he make an appointment for next week.&#160; Martha drove her home for she had bags of clothes &amp; things that she couldn't carry on the bus.&#160; Thanks Martha that was so nice of you!!&#160; I felt just a little better that we were able to help one person today after all the babies that were murdered at Planned Parenthood today.&#160; </span><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Martha wasn't back yet in taking our new client home.&#160; I was on the sidewalk by myself &amp; I looked up to see Memo our&#160;Data Entry person.&#160; I greeted him &amp; he helped me bring in everything that I had on the sidewalk, into the center.&#160; Then we went into the office to do office work for about 1/2 an hour.&#160; He also helped me cancel my old Facebook&#160;&amp; got&#160;me own my&#160;new Facebook page because some one messed it up for me by interfering with my page.&#160; He caused me much pain &amp; frustration.&#160; I have forgiven him &amp; I&#160;wish him well though.&#160; When Memo left Martha had returned &amp; we ate supper &amp; then went to Confession &amp; Mass at&#160;St. Jude's Church at 7:30pm.&#160; Lord I need you &amp; I'm so sorry that Planned Parenthood&#160;kills your children today &amp; every day.&#160; Why do women want their babies dead????&#160; </span></div><span style="font-size: medium"><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: medium">Tuesday, May 31, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Martha was giving Holy Communion to the residents of&#160;a Nursing Home this morning &amp; she told me that she would be at the center when she had finished her rounds.&#160; So after Mass today I went to the center alone.&#160; Paul, who was also at the Mass,&#160; was nice enough to go get us some lunch at Wendy's &amp; to bring it back for us to eat it before we went out to the front lines.&#160; Just as I was pulling into the parking lot, of the center,&#160;I saw Sandy coming.&#160; I parked my car &amp; then greeted her &amp; told her that today nothing was in my car to get out.&#160; She was happy about that.&#160; I said that most of the work is in&#160;the Great Room, to finish&#160;up there &amp; then we'll be all done, until we receive more donations again, to put away.&#160; I did some odd &amp; end things in the center waiting for Paul &amp; Martha.&#160; Paul came first to bring the lunch which I quickly ate &amp; then Paul &amp; I went out to the front lines.&#160; The temperature was about 90 degrees.&#160; He brought out the signs &amp; I brought out the literature box &amp; stool to set it on &amp; the mega phone &amp; started to speak.&#160; I saw a young girl standing by her car near where I was standing by the fence.&#160; I told her that they kill babies here.&#160; She said that everyone has a choice.&#160; This I do not want to hear.&#160; I said that you never have a choice to have your baby be killed you can only choose other things like cars or ice cream flavors not to kill a child.&#160; Then she said that she had her&#160;daughter in the car.&#160; I said "what! you brought your&#160;daughter into a place that kills children???&#160; If you brought someone here today that is having her baby killed then you are an accessory to murder &amp; why would you want that on your conscious for the rest of your life??&#160; She will hate you someday that you brought her into Planned Parenthood to have her baby be killed &amp; you did nothing to save her or her baby's life.&#160; Your friendship will end.&#160; She put out her cigarette &amp; went back into the car.&#160; I turned around to see Martha standing there, boy was I happy to see her.&#160; Paul went back into the center to help Sandy with the donations to put away.&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Martha gave a Truth packet to&#160;guy in a grey truck &amp; talked to him for&#160; a few minutes, while he was coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Later on he drove by us &amp; threw the Truth packet at us. I went over to pick it up &amp; to put it with the other Truth packets in the literature box.&#160; His lost, for it had a&#160;lot of information in it&#160;that could help him.&#160; It's a good thing that he didn't hit me with it, otherwise it would have been a 911 call.&#160;&#160;What's wrong with people???&#160; As I went on sidewalk counseling I heard a familiar voice of old the neighbor from across the street Dr. Jim screaming tome saying "Mary, Mary, for I didn't turn around, why don't you leave these people alone &amp; keep quite".&#160; He was getting his windows cleaned,&#160;to his condo, which is right in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160;&#160;Unbelievable to buy a home right&#160;across the street from an abortion mill.&#160; Him &amp; his buddy, right next door, Jim Bovey which is as bad as he is in harassing&#160;me.&#160; Lord have Mercy on their souls.&#160; Ignorant people &amp; after all these years too.&#160; They will have to answer before God someday &amp; I hope that they haven repented first.&#160; I pray for them daily &amp; I know that another pro lifer does too.&#160; Maybe they'll change &amp; maybe they won't.&#160; I'm &#160;thinking of&#160;calling my Attorney regarding them harassing me while I am engaging in my Constitutional Right to protest &amp; engage in my freedom of speech, at the abortion mill.&#160; I'm also thinking of contacting the Thomas More Society regard these two men.&#160; Enough is enough!!!&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Tim showed up to work on the cabinet in the Material Aid Room where we store the signs, literature box &amp; other things.&#160; The hinge fell off on the one side of the door, so he wanted to take a look at it so he knew what he would need to bring with him when he comes back on Thursday to repair it so it will be strong &amp; sturdy.&#160; Thanks Tim!!&#160; I was in the center with Tim for awhile so I asked Paul to go outside to be with Martha on the front lines.&#160; He was nice enough to go out to be with her so that she wasn't alone.&#160; Tim also came into the office to work on the computer for me to expand the time frame before I have to log in again.&#160; Poor guy, he was hungry so he took a protein bar from the bowl, in the office &amp; also A protein drink that just came in.&#160; It's sort of a Ensure drink with vitamins &amp; minerals &amp; protein.&#160; He should be all set until supper time. I&#160;wish that I had time to have made him a sandwich but it's so crazy out on the front lines &amp; I needed to get back.&#160; He was appreciative for the two food items in a pinch.&#160; Tim left &amp; I went back to the front line with bottled water &amp; a protein drink too.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I thanked Paul to come out to be with Martha &amp; he went back into the nice air conditioned center to once again help Sandy with the Material Aid.&#160; That's okay Paul, I understand, we need you in the center too.&#160; Just as I had offered Martha a nice cold bottle of purified water two girls came down the street one was pregnant &amp; the other girl was not.&#160; Martha offered the two girls the bottle water that I just brought out &amp; they took it &amp; thanked us for our kindness.&#160; Martha mentioned that we had baby clothes in the center &amp; the pregnant girl said that they would stop by another time for they needed to go home so that her friend could change her clothes.&#160; She knows where we're located so when she needs something for&#160;her baby daughter, who will be born at the end of July, she knows where to come.&#160; Bye girls &amp; enjoy the water.&#160; After they left I woofed down the protein drink before Martha gave that away too, ha ha.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Martha was in the center for she needed to get more water for it was well passed 90 degrees out today.&#160; I stayed out on the sidewalk by myself.&#160; I saw that a man in a wheel chair was being wheeled by a woman &amp; I was ready as they passed by me to offer them a Rosary.&#160; They didn't pass by me for they went into Planned Parenthood instead.&#160; How sad I thought.&#160; They came out a few minutes later with bottle water &amp; a bag of condoms on his lap.&#160; Ick!!&#160;&#160; I asked why they would go into Planned Parenthood &amp; he said "for some water".&#160; I said for condoms too. He looked surprised.&#160; I went over to the literature box to get two Rosaries &amp; a Truth packet &amp; handed it to them.&#160; I tried to talk to themas much as I could about what they were doing to their souls &amp; lives.&#160; I was disappointed to learn that later on Martha told me that they went back into Planned Parenthood, for she said that someone in a wheel chair went in with a woman.&#160; Maybe they went in to tell then off&#160; after reading the Truth packets brochures.&#160; There is so much we'll never know.&#160; The only thing that we need to be is faithful to God in our ministries.&#160; He'll let us know someday &amp; remember it's all God's grace, we are just His instruments &amp; are doing what is expected of us as Christians.&#160; God be the Glory!!&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I twas time to go into the center so Paul came out to help us bring the signs, back into the center.&#160; I stayed out for a little longer by myself with the one sign &amp; the literature box &amp; mega phone. I stopped a young girl &amp; started to speak to her.&#160; She said that she was going in there for a Depo shot.&#160; I told her the dangers of that shot &amp; how it can kill your baby if you do become pregnant on it.&#160; It also will mess up your Reproductive System &amp; can cause bone fractures too.&#160; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; told her to hide it so that no one would take it, at Planned Parenthood,&#160;for she wasn't a strong person.&#160; She came out later on &amp; said that this was her last shot but I said that it maybe one to many.&#160; I said that if she needed anything or even just to talk to come by the center when we're there, the days &amp; hours are on the door.&#160; As she was walking away she said "thank you" &amp; I told her that I cared about her.&#160; She seemed to&#160;believe for she gave me a smile back.&#160; I think that she is being used by the man or men in her life.&#160; Poor baby for she's in my heart &amp; prayers.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I finally went in for the many girls that were going into Planned Parenthood ignored me but I at least gave them the Truth before I left to go back into the center.&#160; When I got to the center there was Pat sitting in the Green Room talking to Martha &amp; Sandy for Paul had left earlier on.&#160; I went over to her to give her a hug &amp; a kiss on the cheek.&#160; We all talked for awhile &amp; Pat had already picked out some nice things that we had in the Material Aid Room.&#160; We were talking for about 15 minutes when all of a sudden a man walked into the Green Room holding his chest.&#160; Pat said "hi Jerry" &amp; the we all realized that this man was probably having a Heart Attack.&#160; I called 911 &amp; asked for them to sent an ambulance stat (immediately) &amp; the 911 operator then asked me about 7 or 8 questions regarding the situation with this man.&#160; After I finished with all the question &amp; thanked her &amp; had hung up I went outside to wait for the ambulance to arrive.&#160; In less then 5 minutes it arrived.&#160; I lead then to the gentleman &amp; they started to work on him.&#160; They gave him aspirin &amp; a nitroglygercin tablet right away, under his tongue.&#160; The one ambulance attendant wasn't that nice but that's okay as long as he took good care of the patient.&#160; About four men from the Fire Department came through the door &amp; were told by the ambulance attendant that he had every thing under control so they left.&#160; They finally placed Jerry in the ambulance &amp; took him to Strong.&#160; Pat will check on him later.&#160; She said that she saw him walking down the street going towards Scio St. where he lives, so she picked him up.&#160; He was in the van, which Martha &amp; I didn't know about for awhile &amp; it was so hot out today.&#160; I think that Pat forgot that he was in the van.&#160; Hopefully it wasn't a Heart Attack but maybe nerves for he was looking for another apartment which can be stressful to say the least.&#160; I will see how he's doing tomorrow.&#160;Please pray for Jerry.&#160; Thank you. &#160;Pat stayed for a little while longer then she left.&#160; Martha &amp; I started to cook supper &amp; sat down to eat when Dan came in.&#160; He wasn't hungry so after we ate he did some odd &amp; end jobs for us &amp; he said that he'll come by tomorrow again.&#160; He is a God sent to us same as everyone else that works to help us at Focus.&#160;

in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">When I arrived at Focus I saw that a young couple were walking into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I grabbed a Truth packet from my car &amp; walked over to Planned Parenthood to try to speak to them but I was to late for they both were already in the building.&#160; I tried to call out to&#160;them,&#160;in my own voice, to give them important facts about Planned Parenthood &amp; how&#160;I can help them.&#160; As I was there by the fence a woman &amp; her children came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I started to talk to her.&#160; As she was leaving I offered her the Truth packet &amp; she stopped along side of me, on the sidewalk.&#160; She said to me that she wasn't there for an abortion.&#160; I told her that I knew that but you by being here you keep this place open so that&#160;others can kill&#160;their children.&#160; I then said that they were racist &amp; then she took the packet from me &amp; I said "thank you" &amp; then she rode away.&#160; I stayed for a few more minutes then went to the center to be with Martha to do some work in the Focus Center.&#160; We decided to go out to the front lines around 2:45pm &amp; stayed for an hour and a half.&#160; It was such a windy day that all we could only bring out&#160;one sign to hold &amp; one sign to tie around the tree &amp; the literature box.&#160; I went back into the center for a few minutes to get something &amp; when I came back out Martha told&#160;me that she had passed out two Truth packets &amp; I was so happy to hear this.&#160; No one was responsive to the Truth today. Martha went&#160;to her car to get something &amp; I was alone standing on the sidewalk when someone threw, from their car,&#160;a plastic water bottle at me&#160;(darn those water bottles, for this is the second&#160;time this year)&#160; &amp; ran over it &amp; it made such a bad noise, which sounded like a gun shot.&#160; I was happy when Martha came back to be with me.&#160; Two are better than one out here.&#160; Martha prayed &amp; I counseled.&#160; As one of the workers drove out of the parking lot I asked her to Google the word 'sin', for it does exist.&#160; Martha &amp; I stayed outside &amp; tackled the wind until Tucker came at around 4:20pm to relieve us.&#160; We talked briefly &amp; Martha &amp; I went back into the center to do more work there.&#160; I had to make up some Truth packets &amp; to make some phone calls.&#160; Martha called the Station of the Cross &amp;&#160;the Focus Pregnancy Help Center donated to their fundraiser &amp; challenged other pro lifers to call in to the station to donate to its great work&#160;in Evangelize others, who listen to the Station in Rochester &amp; in Buffalo, NY..&#160; They announced our challenge on the air.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Our landlord came to collect the rent &amp; Martha I&#160; sat down to have a talk with him for&#160;next month, for&#160;our rent will go up $200 due to an agreement that I made with him in September of 2010 regarding new indoor/outdoor carpet to be installed in the center.&#160; Focus paid for it &amp; Bernie reimbursed us until the carpet was paid in full, which it is now. &#160;He was nice enough to increase it only $100 more, so next month our rent will be $1,700.00 &amp; if we fail to pay him in full then we can add it on to the next months rent.&#160; We talked about some fundraiser&#160;&#160;ideas.&#160; This man has changed &amp; it was because of prayer.&#160;We have a better relationship &amp; can communicate now, it's so much better.&#160; Thank you Lord for touching Bernie!!!&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><span style="font-size: medium">If anyone wants&#160;to donate to our work in helping moms &amp;

it was Dan.&#160; Martha prepared supper &amp; I continued to do more office work until the supper was on the table.&#160; Dan ate with us but didn't have any sausages but he enjoyed the baked beans &amp; macaroni salad &amp; the homemade Rhubarb pie for desert, that Martha made.&#160; After we ate Dan took out the trash &amp; fixed the ceiling title that was all wet from the rain storm.&#160; Our Landlord is patching up the roof as best as he can&#160;so that we don't have many more leaks from the ceiling.&#160; I asked&#160;my friend from the taxi company to clean the&#160;rug from the water stain on it from the last flood that we had&#160;from the rain storm about a month ago.&#160;&#160;He is so nice to do it in the shared All Purpose Room ( I keep everyone busy, 'delegate' that's my motto, in getting things done).&#160;&#160;Focus received a gift certificate from Sam's Club&#160;for diapers, so Martha &amp; I decided to go tonight in Greece to pick up the gift certificate &amp; to buy diapers with it.&#160; As she went to the corner to get gas &amp; worked on the American Life League order for Rob to call in &amp; to order more brochures for our Truth packets.&#160; I called him &amp; gave him the order&#160;for him to place it tomorrow.&#160; Martha returned, from the gas station,&#160;&amp; Dan had left to go home.&#160; I followed Martha to&#160;Sam's Club, on Ridge Rd.&#160;for the gift&#160;certificate that we were just blessed with to buy diapers for the Focus Center.</span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I'm sorry that I don't have an update on the condition of Jerry, who had chest pain yesterday at the center&#160;&amp; we called 911 for an ambulance&#160;but Pat didn't call me back regarding his condition.&#160; I don't know his last name otherwise I would have called the hospital.&#160; When I know something I will let you know but please continue to pray for Jerry &amp;

They left when Paul got there.&#160; We prayed and spoke to people all morning. We met a young lady who was there for birth control, informed her of the abortive nature of those hormones, and spoke of abstinence until marriage. She promised to read the information in the packet, and pray. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><br />
Next a gentleman went in, saying he was just cutting through. He was soon back with us,&#160; since the surrounding fences are secure. He was pro-life,&#160; but felt a woman should be able to choose. So we talked about free will. We can choose right or wrong. I could choose to kill Paul…..(we laughed), but I wouldn’t. It would be wrong….it would be murder. He wouldn’t kill anyone either. And yes, a woman can choose to kill her baby, but it would be wrong……it would be murder. He selected a rosary, and promised to pray for our success outside PP.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><br />
A woman and man and older baby came by. She was going for a checkup.&#160; She had an abortion in November. Why? Because she didn’t have a car, or enough money to look after two children. As we spoke I could see she was getting upset. She should be…she killed her baby! Would she kill the baby she already has if it were inconvenient to raise him? No, of course not. I urged her to come to Focus if she became pregnant again. We could talk to her about many alternatives, such as adoption, and we could suggest agencies that could help if she decided to keep the baby. She already received a packet last year, so I gave her Project Rachel information from a packet, and a rosary. She promised to pray.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><br />
A woman (pro-life) who has four children came out. She had just gotten an IUD inserted. She doesn’t want any more children. She has had trouble with various forms of birth control (bleeding), but likes to know it is in place. We talked to her about the abortive nature of IUD’s, and also about adoption as an alternative if she were to get pregnant. She is married, so I told her about Natural Family Planning. She thought it was the old rhythm method, and she is irregular. I was too, and it worked for me, even for indicating my first ovulation after childbirth. She liked the idea that it is natural….no side effects, and FREE!! She was in a hurry,(children in the car) so she gave me her address to send information .<br />
Paul was planning to go to noon mass, but when a woman came by for a pregnancy test at 11:50, he offered to stay, and find a later mass. This woman used RU486 a couple years ago, and would never ever have an abortion again. We did her test, and she picked out some nice clothes for her three month old baby. She took home a packet, and some thoughts about abstinence until marriage, because she knows that is what God wants of her. Dan and Addison and Adolf&#160; were outside on the front lines when I left.</span></div><div>&#160;</div></div><hr /><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Hurrah!!&#160; No abortions today!!&#160; The Death&#160;Abortionist wasn't there &amp; at times the parking lot was empty &amp; the workers left early.&#160; The regular abortionist Rachael Phelps hasn't been there in two weeks but was replaced by another abortionist because last Thursday was&#160;a Blood Bath.&#160; I'm sure that she'll be back for I get hopeful &amp; then get disappointed.&#160; She's probably on vacation or out on tour across the country speaking of how to 'Prevent Teen Pregnancies' to which she seems to be an expert, for what reason I don't know, for her methods are destructive not constructive.&#160; When I arrived&#160;on the front lines I was greeted by Sheila who sidewalk counsels from 10:30am to 1pm, on Thursdays&#160;&amp; is a blessing to the team.&#160; She counsels in such a gentle &amp; informative way.&#160; She tells the tough truth with love &amp; gentleness not like me that gives the truth with tough love &amp; more sternness.&#160; We all have our own 'special' way to get the truth across &amp; we are all guided by the Holy Spirit.&#160; She's &#160;a blessing to us&#160;&amp; is a vital addition to the team,&#160;in&#160;her work, on the front lines &amp; in the Focus Center, in saving &amp; changing lives for Christ.&#160;</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Sheila came into the center, as I was preparing to get the graphic signs to go to the front lines, to give me a review of her time spent on the sidewalk &amp; in the center.&#160; After she gave my a run down she had to leave &amp; then I went out to the sidewalk where Martha was praying along with Paul, Dan, Addison &amp; Maryanne.&#160; Dan &amp; Addision handed my both a check for our work at Focus so I went back into the center to put the envelopes on my desk, for a future thank you letter.&#160; I went back outside &amp; a few minutes later Suzanne, our Thursday counselor,&#160;came &amp; she greeted me out on the sidewalk &amp; then went into the center to make some phone calls to our clients to see how they were doing.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">There were two old male&#160;Death Escorts, one who has been a Death Escort for many years &amp; the other only a short time.&#160; How sad it is to see them come over to the cars &amp; lead these young girls into the Killing Mill.&#160; The 'Pied Piper' mentally.&#160; It's so sad &amp; disturbing to see how the girls don't have any boundaries&#160;&amp; are so naive &amp; gullible, it's scary.&#160; I saw that a young girl was talking to one of the Death Escorts so I went over to the brick side of the building to try to reason with her &amp; while I was there &amp; called over to Martha that someone was t walking up the sidewalk.&#160; I saw that the young girl had stopped to talk to Martha &amp; I continued to speak to the girl that I was trying to get through.&#160; After she went into Planned Parenthood I crossed over to the other side of the sidewalk where my usual post is.&#160; I spoke to Bill who was protesting across the street to ask him if he knew the name of the man who usually harasses me &amp; another pro lifer.&#160;&#160;Bill told me to go to the library to find out his last name.&#160; I guess it's public information, we'll see.&#160; My next project.&#160;&#160;He needs a letter from a lawyer or the Thomas More Society to stop interfering with us as we try to save lives &amp; educate people without his screaming out to us in a offensive way.&#160; It's going to be a long summer.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">I went back to the sidewalk as Martha was finishing talking to this young girl &amp; she was given a Truth packet &amp; was told to hide it so that the Death Escorts wouldn't take it as she was going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I asked Martha wheat was she going in for &amp; she told me "for the Patch, which is another form of Birth Control, which is dangerous &amp; it has taken lives too.&#160; I told Martha that I thought that it was taken off the market because it had killed some women &amp; is very dangerous but I forgot that Planned Parenthood doesn't care about these young girls or any women.&#160; Duh!&#160; She came out&#160;of Planned Parenthood a few minutes later &amp; the Death Escort was talking to her which does make my blood boil, I'll admit it &amp; it's because they lie &amp; deceive these girls &amp; are sick &amp; evil acting people that I don't want any of these girls to fall into their trap.&#160; Thank God she came back over to us on the sidewalk &amp; I escorted her into the Focus Center to the dismay of the Death Escort.&#160; As we were walking in the center I asked her what had changed her mind for she had told me that she decided not to get the Patch.&#160; She said it was because of what the other lady had told her about the Patch.&#160; "Great" I said back to her.&#160; I lead her into the Rose Room which is our pregnancy testing/counseling/literature room &amp; gave her a brochure on the Patch.&#160; I also gave her some other pieces of literature &amp; spoke with her for a few minutes until Suzanne came in to speak to her too.&#160; She said that she had been there at this center before for a pregnancy test.&#160; I don't know who gave her the test but she was receptive of hearing the Truth &amp; receiving the information that we gave her today.&#160; This incident made me very happy.&#160; She was now in good hands with Suzanne.</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Paul was in the center helping to put away baby &amp; children clothes &amp; small items.&#160; Thanks Paul.&#160; I knew that Martha was in good hands outside&#160; with Adolf, Maryanne &amp; Bill so I quickly made up a sandwich &amp; wolfed it down with some ice tea.&#160; I went back outside &amp; was pleasantly surprised to see Val, our client who just had given birth to twins, a boy &amp; a girl, about 6 weeks ago.&#160; Martha &amp; I got to talk with her &amp; she even held a sign, as&#160;a witness to others driving by.&#160; You go girl!!&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><hr /><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: medium">Tuesday, June 7, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I wanted to get to Planned Parenthood earlier, for&#160;I&#160;feel so badly that no pro lifers are their witnessing, calling out or praying on the sidewalk, when the girls are going in for the RU 486 chemical abortions.&#160; I got to the center &amp; unloaded my car of the bags &amp; boxes that I had of diapers &amp; wipes &amp; food for supper etc..&#160; Then I went out to the front lines with a some literature packets &amp; my sign.&#160; Just when I arrived a woman came out onto the sidewalk &amp; I began speaking to her.&#160; I offered her the Truth packet &amp; she walked over to me to receive it.&#160; I asked her why she&#160;would come to Planned Parenthood &amp; she told me it was for a Depo shot.&#160; I told her about the Depo shot &amp; told her that there was a brochure in the packet, that I just gave her,&#160;that will give her more information in regards to the shot that she just received.&#160; I spoke about God &amp; how He wants us to be married first before having sex &amp; about eternal life &amp; to repent to the God that loves her.&#160; She was very nice &amp; receptive to what I was trying to say to her.&#160; Her ride was now here &amp; she said "thank you &amp; good bye".&#160; I said to her "God bless you &amp; have a great day".&#160; I then went over to the fence to speak to some people that just drove into Planned Parenthood.&#160; After they went into to that horrible place&#160;I went back to my car to go to the 12:10 Mass downtown at Our Lady of Victory Church where I sat with Martha.&#160; After the Mass, Martha, Paul &amp; I went to Focus.&#160; Paul was nice enough to go to Wendy's to get us our lunch while Martha &amp; I put away some things &amp; dealt with another water leak that was coming down from the ceiling.&#160; She called the landlord &amp; he said that the air conditioner was leaking &amp; that he would come on over, which he never did.&#160; I'm sure that he will come by tomorrow to fix it.&#160; What a mess on the carpet again.&#160; Water, water &amp; more water, on the new indoor/ outdoor carpet, ick!!&#160; </span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">We ate our fattening Wendy's lunch of hamburgers &amp; French fries, mmm good though.&#160; It gets us through the afternoon battle out on the front lines.&#160; We finally got out on the sidewalk.&#160; Paul helped us with the signs &amp; then he went in to work in the Material Aid Room which he enjoys.&#160; He cleans the toys &amp; puts our donations away awaiting the next mom to come in to get what&#160;she needs.&#160; He's been such a blessing to us since Donna &amp; Carole had to leave, on the front lines, as their lives changed.&#160; God does provide for us at Focus.&#160; So Martha &amp; I were out on the sidewalk praying &amp; sidewalk counseling.&#160; As Martha went into the center to get something, I was out there by myself.&#160; As I was alone a car had drove by &amp; a female voice hollered out her window saying "I hope you die".&#160; I called back to her saying "we're all going to die, I hope that you repent".&#160; How sad, for I can figure out, that she's probably post abortive.&#160; I wish that she would have stopped so that I could help her.&#160; I guess she's an angry woman that's still in denial.&#160; How sad.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that post abortive women, which are many, will get out of denial fast &amp; seek God's forgiveness for their grievous sin of having their baby killed, &amp; to get the help, that they need,&#160;through the different programs that are out there in the pro life community.&#160;

I asked him if he would write, in chalk, a pro life message, on the sidewalk.&#160; So he took the blue chalk &amp; wrote:&#160; Crisis Pregnancy Help, 1-800-395-HELP. 24/7.&#160; I said "thank you Paul" &amp; he went back into the center to continue his work.&#160; Martha said that she would get the chalk that glows in the dark so that our message will be seen even at night.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">Martha &amp;

So there was probably another abortionist there today.&#160; Usually on Tuesdays they do the RU486 chemical abortions, which is sad, to say the least.&#160; Lord have Mercy on us!!! &#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span><span style="font-size: small"><div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: medium">Wednesday, June 8, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha came right over to the center after the noon Mass downtown.&#160; Sandy came today instead of yesterday, for she was picking up her new car, will not brand new but new to her.&#160;She worked putting away things &amp; cleaning things that were brought into the center for the Material Aid Room.&#160; Martha &amp; I&#160;did spent some time in the center first before we went out in the blazing heat which never stops us nor does the cold.&#160; We witnessed out there, for a couple of hours, keeping hydrated with water &amp; me &amp; my ice tea, which is my favorite drink next to a glass of good red wine, which I can't have on the front lines, but some days I wish that I could.&#160; I depend not on wine but on God's power, through the Holy Spirit, to guide&#160;me to what to do &amp; what to say out there when&#160;I approach people&#160;I don't even know but love &amp; care about.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">The neighbor Jim, who lives in one of&#160;the condos across the street, who has given us, especially Rob &amp; I a hard time for many years now hollering nasty things at us &amp; disturbing our efforts in trying to do our work in our ministry, well I have had enough in trying to deal with him.&#160; I contacted my attorney &amp; she said that she will write him a letter that will inform him of our rights out there on the front lines &amp; to get his home owner insurance&#160;ready, for he might have to use it for a law suit in the future, if he doesn't behave himself.&#160; I rest my case.&#160; I prayed for so many years for this scenario to change &amp; then I heard the quite voice of the Lord who said to my spirit "then do something about it".&#160; I was then lead to call my attorney &amp; I did something about it so my prayer was heard &amp; answered.&#160; He will receive a letter form my attorney on Tuesday, of next week.&#160; So many times we pray &amp; expect God to do everything, though He is capable, but remember He uses our voice, hands &amp; feet to accomplish many things &amp; in this case he used my hands to pick up the phone to call my attorney &amp; my voice to tell her the situation &amp; now the results should be that he won't bother us anymore or be sued.&#160; I know that Christians aren't suppose to sue anyone so I probably won't sue him.&#160; I just want him to stop screaming my name out from across the street &amp; stop saying bizarre things to me as I'm trying to do my job, in saving &amp;

I gave then each a hug.&#160; They said that they just arrived &amp; were going to pray.&#160; I was worried that I might be bothering them with me on the mega phone &amp; offered to go to the brick side of Planned Parenthood but Pat thought that it would be better for me to stay on the bush side of Planned Parenthood with them.&#160; Pat said that I didn't bother them while they were praying.&#160; She told me that she wasn't going to be there next week, for she'll be on vacation in Florida, but Bill said that he will be here praying next Thursday.&#160; I&#160;intend to be there next week at 10 am again.&#160; I was calling out to the people that were walking into Planned Parenthood to have their precious baby be killed, for this is their surgical abortion day.&#160;

Another dead baby &amp; wounded family for years to come &amp; maybe generations to come.&#160; How evil is that.&#160; Just imagine to find out years later that your parents brought you to a place that had killed your brother or sister.&#160;

She went over to the brick side of the building to pray.&#160; Then Maryann came &amp; went over to be with Mary S..&#160; I told her that one of the pro lifers wanted to apologize to her for being quite abrupt, with her,&#160;last week when she told him that she had voted for Obama.&#160; He was quite upset with her to say the least but realized that he was a Christian &amp; wanted to apologize to her, for&#160;how he spoke to her last week.&#160; She said that the apology was accepted &amp; that no matter what happens out here, on the front lines, she will still be hear saying her Rosary.&#160; I just informed her that we don't usually talk about politics, when we're here on the&#160;sidewalk, for our mission is to try to save lives &amp; souls through love &amp; truth &amp; educational brochures &amp; DVD's &amp; CD's.&#160; She seemed to understand what I was saying but when she went over to be with Mary S.&#160; I saw that she was probably talking politics again, which I found out later I was correct.&#160; Mary S. said that she held her own &amp; stood strong about what she believed in.&#160; This is what sometimes happens when some one new comes to join us, which is a pain &amp; it takes away for what we are really are called to do out on the front lines which is to pray &amp; to inform &amp; to witness to the people that we meet out there.&#160; Lord please continue to protect out ministry &amp; to guide us.&#160; Amen &amp; thank you.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Just then Addison &amp;

It was marvelous to behold.&#160; Suzanne called in to say that she will be late today &amp; she will get to the center as soon as she could.&#160; I am grateful for her presence every Thursday for she is a very busy woman.&#160; When she arrived she made some calls to our moms to see how they were doing.&#160; When Bill came he walked around the sidewalk &amp; sprinkled Holy Water then went to witness across the street with his graphic sign Malachi.&#160; Then Addison &amp; Dan went over to the brick side of the building to pray, for Mary S. &amp; Maryann had gone.&#160; Around 2:30pm Adolf came to pray &amp; I was so glad because I was in the center for awhile &amp; was concerned that maybe Martha was by herself, out there,&#160;&amp; I was so happy to see that Adolf was now with her &amp; that she&#160;hadn't been&#160;alone.&#160; Praise God!&#160; We had a total of 11 pro lifers here today from 10am to 5pm at all different times but it was always covered during those hours.&#160; It was a great witness &amp; blessing, that's for sure.&#160; Maybe because of this a couple didn't go in but drove right passed us &amp; their baby was saved from being killed here today.&#160; I hope so.&#160;

He's been&#160;a big help, since he's retired.&#160; We are blessed with many donations especially from my friend who runs a second hand store.&#160; We get things that are so great to give to our moms.&#160; What a blessing this is to us &amp; to them.&#160; We receive other donations from good people in the community too.&#160; Our little room is always jammed packed with so much, it's unbelievable!!&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">It was depressing, out on the front lines, for to&#160;my knowledge no babies were saved from being killed by Rachael Phelps, who came in at 10:45am this morning &amp; hasn't stopped killing little sweet babies just created by God since.&#160; How could she????&#160; How could they????</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I went into the center to get something &amp; I saw that Bernie, our Landlord, was there trying to fix the leaky air conditioner which is causing water, from the ceiling, to come down onto the floor in the All Purpose Room.&#160; He got his ladder &amp; tried to fix it saying that he thought that he did.&#160; Later on we found out that he didn't &amp; Martha called him to come back&#160;the next day to try again.&#160; I wish that we didn't have so much water problems at the center.&#160; The carpet is a mess &amp;&#160; it's not even a year old yet.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">The Death Escorts were there, greeting the people coming into Planned Parenthood.&#160;They come right up to the car &amp; greets them &amp; then walks them into the mill&#160;after first holding the door&#160;open for them, giving them the wrong impression for sure. &#160;Grandma &amp; Grandpa death, the&#160;two older people that should know better, were there.&#160;Then Berry Swan came driving in &amp; it was a trio of deathers.&#160; It made me sick to my stomach.&#160; I try not to go there &amp; call names or&#160;to get personal but I lost it today &amp; told Berry Swan&#160;that he was old &amp; fat &amp; was&#160;heading for his grave unprepared, for the next life, which is eternal.&#160; I told him that I hoped that he doesn't have a Heart Attack or a&#160;Stoke that will take him unexceptionally &amp; if he hadn't repented yet, that would not be so good for his soul sake.&#160; I always hope that he does repent &amp; does it now, as I hope &amp; pray for all the death escorts &amp; staff &amp; all&#160;abortionists, throughout the world.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I went back into the center to talk to Suzanne about some things &amp; when I was there the doorbell rang &amp; it was Israel.&#160; I hadn't seen her in a long time &amp; I gave her a big hug.&#160; I said that I was so happy to see&#160;her &amp; did Martha know that&#160;she were here?&#160; She said that she had stopped on the sidewalk to say to Martha &amp; I was glad to hear that.&#160; She had her priestly collar on &amp; her rainbow belt on with the tattoos on her arm &amp; her very short hair with purple stripes in it but we still love our Israel &amp; we don't judge her but we still tell her the Truth.&#160; I introduced her to Paul&#160;&amp; Suzanne.&#160; I told her about the march&#160;a week from this&#160;Saturday &amp; Paul said that he would pick her up for it &amp; they both exchanged their phone numbers to make arrangements for that day.&#160; I was content that she will join us in the&#160;'March for Life' on June 18th. at 1pm at Our Lady of Victory Church parking lot.&#160;&#160;Then we will march down St. Paul Blvd. to Main St. then to Gibbs St. to University Ave.&#160;then we will pray, the Rosary,&#160;in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; The Focus Center will have deserts &amp; refreshment for the marchers afterwards.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that we will get a good turn out &amp; that no pro deathers (choicers) will be out there to confront us.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Martha &amp; I talked to some people who were walking on the sidewalk &amp; we handed out some Truth packets out to people that were open to the Truth, but to my knowledge&#160;and&#160;I can be wrong, no baby was saved from killed here today.&#160; Only God knows for sure &amp; maybe&#160;I will know for sure some day that I was wrong.&#160;&#160; We are to be obedient &amp; let God do the rest.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">It was about 5pm &amp; everyone had left including Martha for she had plans tonight so I went into the center.&#160; I walked into the office &amp; I put my head down on the desk &amp; slept for an hour only to be awakened about three times when the phone rang &amp; no one answered.&#160; Then I was really awakened by the door bell, for I was expecting Dan tonight.&#160; I got up to answer the door &amp; it was the pizza man for Kaybee, who works in the Taxi company.&#160; I put my head into their office &amp; boldly asked for a piece of pizza to which I was given two pieces.&#160; I ate them with my iced tea &amp; the doorbell rang again.&#160; I got up to see who it was only to see Dan standing there.&#160; I was glad to see him.&#160; I opened the door to let him in &amp; then feed him some leftovers that we had in the refrigerator.&#160; He was happy.&#160; After he ate I put him to work to do some odd &amp; end jobs that only Dan can do.&#160; I am so grateful for his weekly visits to Focus to help us out.&#160; What a God sent, he is.&#160; After we finished our work in the center I went over to St. Jude's Church,&#160;to go to the prayer service there.&#160; After the service my cell phone rang &amp; it was my friend Anne &amp; I talked &amp; walked all around the campus of the Church until I hung up about 15 minutes later &amp; went on home to have a glass of red wine &amp; to relax a little &amp; to reflect on this very difficult death day at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was grateful to God that we did have such a great turn out of prayerful pro lifers today, though I did miss Sheila, who I hope is having a great time in England.&#160; I wish I was there with you Sheila!!!&#160; :)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;<div><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: medium">Tuesday, June 14, 2011 in front of Planned Parenthood</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha , Paul &amp; I arrived to the center after Mass this afternoon &amp; Sandy came about 10 minutes later to help out in the center.&#160; Paul went again to Wendy's to pick up a hamburger &amp; French fries, which is not low cal but quick.&#160; When he came back we all ate.&#160; I showed Martha the letter that I received from my Attorney, regarding the pesty neighbor across the street, in the first condo.&#160; It informed him that, in lay man's term, that if he doesn't behave himself, I get his house.&#160; There!!&#160; I&#160;am hoping that this letter will keep him away from us, especially me. We'll see when we go out on the front lines.&#160; I was hurrying both Martha &amp; Paul, for we were running late, in going out onto the sidewalk.&#160; Finally we arrived.&#160; Paul helped us get set up with the signs, then he went back to the center to help Sandy with the donations.&#160; All of a sudden I saw the neighbor Jim&#160;&amp; it looked like he was coming across the street towards me, so I turned around, then I heard a loud voice from across the street &amp; he was screaming at me saying "Mary, Mary you belong in a mental asylum, keep quiet".&#160; I turned around to see him walking down the sidewalk.&#160; A man who was going into the vets approached him,&#160;&amp; confronted&#160;him on his rudeness towards me.&#160; He talked with him for a few minutes then continued to walk down the street towards Gibbs St. &amp; then I knew that he was walking to Seldon St. which is off of Gibbs St. to get his mail.&#160; This is the front of his house.&#160; I was hopefully that when he received the mail &amp; opened up the envelop from my Attorney that he would be nice &amp; never harass me again.&#160; I was wrong, as always.&#160; Earlier it was very cool outside, a very strange day for June &amp; I was wearing my black light weight coat.&#160; It was becoming warmer so when Martha went into the center, with a young woman who just came out of Planned Parenthood, exclaiming that she was pregnant &amp; was going to Focus to fill out an Intake Sheet so that we can call her to see how she's doing, I gave&#160;Martha&#160;my jacket to take into the center.&#160;Oh Darn!!&#160; Just as she had just left there comes Jim out of his condo &amp; comes right over to me with a measuring tape.&#160;He said "Mary lets see where the buffer zone is, &amp; he looks around to see the faint yellow line that Planned Parenthood painted.&#160; I reached for my phone only to realize that I had it in my coat jacket, which was in the center.&#160; I walked swiftly to go get it &amp; to tell Martha want was going on out there.&#160; When I arrived back to the street he was still there measuring the sidewalk.&#160; I used my new cell phone with the camera &amp; took his picture.&#160; He smiled &amp; even posed for the picture, oh brother.&#160; I pretended to use the phone to call my Attorney &amp; he was saying in the background "Mary are you calling the police, I hope so or are calling your Attorney, I think that I'll call her" &amp; off he went back to his condo,&#160;which might be mine if he doesn't wake up &amp; cool it.&#160; Some people never learn.&#160; The young pregnant lady came walking passed me &amp; said "thank you".&#160; I said "you're welcome &amp; we'll be calling you soon to see how you are doing".&#160; She smiled &amp; went back into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood to get her car &amp; off she went .&#160; As she was leaving I waved good bye to her &amp; she waved back.&#160; A few minutes later Martha returned to the sidewalk.&#160; I felt that some one was looking at me &amp; I looked across the street to see that the neighbor Jim, was hiding in the bushes in the front yard of the first condo, taking our picture.&#160; Creepy.&#160; I sometimes feel like I'm in a bad movie that won't end.&#160; I had it !!!&#160; I took out the letter from the envelop &amp; called my Attorney for real this time.&#160; By the grace of God she answered the phone.&#160; I told her what he was doing to us.&#160; She said that he called her office &amp; had left a message &amp; that she will write another letter addressing the fact that he has no right in involving himself with the Injunction for this was a Federal issue not a Local one or a Neighbor one.&#160; The Federal Marshals have to be called &amp; they have to come to see if we are breaking the Injunction &amp; if someone is new on the sidewalk since the Injunction was written has to read the entire 28 pages to the person that wasn't mentioned on the Injunction that we won on Appeal back in 2001.&#160; She said that she will sent me her letter when she composes it &amp; of course she will send Jim one too.&#160; This ought to be good.&#160; Maybe this time he'll leave us alone for he will lose his power that he thinks that he has over us.&#160; He just doesn't understand that&#160;but he will soon.&#160; He's just angry that he bought an expensive condo, early last year, in front of place that has protesters.&#160; He's retired &amp; has so much 'free' time on his hands &amp; he was in the Vietnam War &amp; is probably suffering from Post Traumatic Stress.&#160; I have been a victim of two sexual crimes, one with a knife to my throat,&#160;&amp; I also suffer&#160;with Post Traumatic Stress.&#160;

As I was on the phone, with my Attorney,&#160;he went back into his condo &amp; never came back out again, to bother us again.&#160; Yeah!&#160; </span></font></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha &amp; I were challenged by two young girls who came out to talk to us.&#160;One of the girls looking at the graphic pictures that it was a "choice".&#160; I walked over to her to tell her that deciding what flavor of ice cream was a choice not to kill or not to kill a innocent baby in the womb.&#160; Once your pregnant you just stay that way &amp; let your baby grow &amp; be born just like your mother did for you.&#160; Then one of the girls asked if Homosexuality &amp;&#160;Masturbation was wrong.&#160; We answered the both questions.&#160;&#160; You can be Gay &amp; not sexually active &amp; that's not a sin, it's the sexual activity that's the sin, just like with Heterosexuals.&#160; Masturbation is a sin because your not suppose to engage&#160;in sexual activity with yourself only with your husband.&#160; Then the one girl said that she was an Agnostic.&#160; They left to back into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood, as we found out a few minutes later they were being picked up by two guys that were not nice.&#160; As they were leaving I told her that if she didn't believe in God then just ask Him to reveal Himself to her, then I stretched out my arms to form a cross &amp; told them that&#160;the Lord loves them &amp; died for them.&#160; They left laughing &amp; mocking me.&#160; At least I got a reaction, which was better then being stoic, which really scares me, that usually means that they&#160;are really lost.&#160; There is Hope&#160;for them, hopefully soon rather than later.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">I was standing there sidewalk counseling when a car that just had pulled out of the parking lot stopped right next to me on the sidewalk.&#160; She&#160;said that she was here for birth control&#160;&amp; she started to spot off&#160;if &#160;I would take&#160;the kid.&#160; I said "yes I&#160;would &amp; we also refer the moms to the Bethany Christian Adoption Services, which is a great organization, that helps moms who are pregnant &amp; can't raise their child".&#160; Well I can't afford a kid then she picked up her new &amp; expensive looking cell phone.&#160; I said "but you can afford that phone, so you can afford a baby if you get pregnant".&#160; She quickly answered back to me saying "you don't know who gave me this phone".&#160; Off she went in a huff.&#160; I did hand a Truth packet earlier,&#160;to&#160;a young girl that was on the passenger side &amp; she just looked &amp; didn't say anything.&#160; I was happy that she didn't throw the packet out the window as they left.&#160; There is Hope here.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha handed a Truth packet to a woman in a car that had stopped &amp;

I asked him what was he doing here, getting ready for anything at this point, &amp; he said that he just wanted to stop by to say "hi &amp; to see how we were doing".&#160; "What I said to myself this is great, a police officer we cares"!!!&#160; I asked him if he new Officer Chris &amp; Officer Mike P. but he said that he didn't for he usually works nights.&#160; We spoke for a few more minutes &amp; then said "thank you officer for stopping by" &amp; he said my name is Sergeant Matteo.&#160; I then said "thank you Sergeant &amp; have a great day".&#160; Off he went.&#160; What a very nice encounter of one of Rochester's best.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">A couple walked down the sidewalk &amp; thanked Martha &amp; I for a Rosary that we blessed them with awhile ago.&#160;They were disgusted with what Planned Parenthood does to babies.&#160; They were very sad that women would have their baby's killed, I agreed, I don't understand that either. They said "thank you after Martha gave them another Rosary &amp; off they went down the sidewalk.&#160; &#160;Later on a man came walking down the sidewalk &amp; said "it worked".&#160; We asked him&#160;what did he mean.&#160; He said that after we gave him a Rosary he found a home to live in.&#160; Thank you Mother Mary &amp; Praise God in answering this man's prayer.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Cleveland, our street friend,&#160;came walking down the sidewalk, so I knew that Martha was going to go into the center to feed him &amp; that I would be by myself for awhile.&#160; That's exactly what happened.&#160; I then noticed that someone had put a big bottle of ketchup at the entrance of Planned Parenthood's parking lot.&#160; I was wondering who was going to run over it...... it was the abortionist, Rachael Phelps, when she drove out around 5pm.&#160; The red ketchup spilled out &amp; covered the driveway, how apropo.&#160; I had a chance to speak to her for about 20 seconds, for the traffic was heavy.&#160; I told her that I know that she didn't like to write up Death Certificates for the babies that she kills in there &amp; that she discredits them, as human beings, by calling them Zygotes, Embryos &amp; Fetus's, so that&#160;they can be easily killed.&#160; I then reminded her that she was once a Zygote, Embryo &amp; a Fetus.&#160; I said "if you ask God to forgive you for killing His children, He will".&#160; Then she drove away.&#160; I hope there is Hope for her.&#160; I hope so.&#160; </font></span><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">A few minutes later Eric, the Supervisor, with the stoic face came out to clean up the mess.&#160; I told him that someone had put it down there &amp; but the strangest thing was that the abortionist, Rachael Phelps, had run over it spilling out the red contents all over the entrance to the parking lot.&#160; He picked up the bottle &amp; then went to get a pail of water &amp; threw it on the red contents, thus making it disappear, just like what they do in there with the babies.&#160; Lord have Mercy...........</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">I was so happy to see Paul come out &amp;

He was still working on the huge donation that we just received from a mom in Hilton, that Jose had picked up, for us,&#160;&amp; had brought to the center.&#160; I went into the office to start to make up the Truth packets for we had no more.&#160; On the front lines today we handed out many Truth&#160;packets &amp; DVD's &amp; CD'S,&#160; for educational purposes.&#160; Martha said the Rosary &amp; prayed the Divine Mercy Prayer at the 3 o'clock hour, when she was with me this afternoon, on the front lines.&#160; We also had some moms come into the Material Aid Room today to get some nice 'free' clothes for their children.&#160; It was a busy afternoon on the front lines &amp; in the center.&#160; I thank all the dedicated people who make these two ministries happen.</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">The doorbell rang &amp;

then she put together supper which I brought in for tonight's meal.&#160; She had to leave early to go to a meeting at her Church at 7pm.&#160; I did the dishes &amp; Dan did the vacuuming &amp; took out the trash.&#160;

I&#160;&#160;spoke to her about abstinence&#160;&amp;&#160;gave&#160;her lots of brochures &amp; asked her to call Project Rachel, a post abortive&#160;ministry,&#160;she said that she promised that she will.&#160;

I felt sick to my stomach.&#160; I asked when will she be seeing her.&#160; She said that she lives down the street from her so I gave her all that I could find to give her to give to her cousin &amp; prayed.&#160; I gave her the DVD of the 'Hard Truth' &amp; very graphic pictures &amp; adoption information too.&#160; She said that she will go over there right now &amp; call me tomorrow.&#160; I pray that her cousin will change her mind &amp;

I got to the front lines at 10am &amp; there standing on the sidewalk was Bill praying.&#160; I hollered over to him that I was going into the center to get the signs &amp; literature box &amp; will be right out.&#160; He nodded that he heard me &amp; off I went into the center.&#160; I opened all the center's rooms &amp; went to get the sign, mega phone &amp; literature box to go out to the front lines.&#160; Just then Paul had arrived so he helped me carry out the signs.&#160; He continued to go back &amp; forth to the center until he got all the signs set up on the sidewalk, as a witness to what they are doing in there to these little precious babies by aborting them in their mother's womb's.&#160; I needed to quickly go back into the center for more Truth packets when I saw Martha pull into out parking lot.&#160; I was so surprised &amp; I gave her a big smile to say the least for it was just a little after 10am.&#160; I didn't stop to talk to her because I wanted to get back on the front lines to call out to the women &amp; girls going in there to have their baby killed &amp; to try to convince them not to do this to them or themselves.&#160; As I was walking back to the sidewalk I saw a mother with her baby in a stroller going into the center so I knew that Martha wouldn't be out with me to pray &amp; counsel for awhile for she would be busy with the mom in the Material Aid Room helping her get things for her little one.&#160; I was on the sidewalk with Paul for Bill went home &amp; there comes two young girls walking up the sidewalk.&#160; I asked if they needed a pregnancy test &amp; one of the girls said that she did so I pointed to them where to go to get one for 'free'.&#160; I asked Paul to go with them to the center so they knew where to go for I knew that Martha was still in the center &amp; she could do the test.&#160; So Paul &amp; the two girls headed to the Focus Center to receive the help that they needed.&#160;&#160; Thank God that Martha came early today for this was such a surprise.&#160; I can't wait until Sheila returns next week so she can take over in the morning &amp; I'll be there in the afternoon.&#160; It's so hard to have the cars come into Planned Parenthood knowing that the little baby in the womb of the mother will be killed in the next hour or so.&#160; It's really a nightmare, at least for me it is.&#160; I know that all the people, on the front lines, suffer so much &amp; offer their suffering to the dear &amp; offended Lord who created us all&#160;&amp; died for us all.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">Thank God that Martha was now with me so I asked Paul if he would go into the center to work in the Material Aid Room &amp; put away our donations, which have been so many, to which I'm grateful.&#160; He was more than willing to go do this, in the center, for he doesn't particularly like the front line ministry, which I can't blame him.&#160; Just then a woman was coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I said to her that they kill babies in there so please don't patronage them.&#160; She said back to me that she wasn't there for an abortion &amp; I said that I knew that but you keep the doors open so that they continue to kill babies.&#160; I offered her a Truth packet &amp; Martha gave her the packet &amp; she told her that she was there trying to talk someone out of having an abortion &amp; her name was Valerie &amp; she was from the local church in the community.&#160; Now I know why she was there &amp; we both told her that we would be praying for her &amp; Valerie.&#160; Off she went &amp; our hearts ached to hear that&#160;Valerie was in there contemplating in having her precious little baby be killed at the hands of abortionist, Rachael Phelps.&#160; It made me sick to stomach.&#160; As this was happening Maryann had arrived to pray &amp; then came Dan &amp; Addision to pray&#160;at the brick side of the building.&#160; I was so tired due to this Fibromyalgia &amp; I told Martha that I was going into the center for a bit.&#160; I offered up my suffering to the Lord &amp; went into the Great Room &amp; shut the door &amp; lied down on the sofa there to take a 10 minute nap, otherwise I was afraid that I wasn't going to get through the afternoon in counseling &amp; fighting against the evil that is there.&#160; But I remember Scripture which says "in my weakness is my strength".&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; I rested for 10 minutes &amp; got up &amp; went back out onto the front lines.&#160; It was less then 5 minutes later I saw that the woman from the church that was in there earlier to try to talk Valerie out of having an abortion &amp; she&#160;was driving out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I asked her if she got Valerie out of there &amp; she gave me the thumb's up.&#160; She wasn't in the front seat but was in the back seat, thank God!!&#160; I was so very happy :)&#160; There is something to say about suffering......................</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">It was now about 12:45pm &amp; I looked up the sidewalk to see Rob, who has sidewalk counseled, out in front of Planned Parenthood for the past 15 years, walking towards me.&#160; I was so happy to see him for he is a wonderful counselor &amp; keeps on talking to get the message out to those who need to hear it.&#160; A new Death Escort was being showed around by the PR guy Rick Bartell, at the abortion mill.&#160; He was walking her around the premises of Planned Parenthood &amp; even came out to the front lines to let her see what she was up against.&#160; A few minutes later there comes the old timer, Sylvia Rose, who is the Mother (I use that only as a term loosely)&#160;of all Death Escorts, who has been there almost as long as Rob &amp; I have been out there, for 15 years.&#160; You'd think that she would have listened to the Truth by now, for all those years that it has been spoken,&#160;&amp; had turned away a long time ago but no not yet. For she, as all the other death escorts,&#160;are still blinded by the darkness of the evil that they do there at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Lord please remove the blinders from their eyes, ears &amp; heart, so that they would be 'set free' &amp; repent &amp; do good.&#160; Thank you Lord. Amen!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">A Budweiser beer truck parked right along side of Martha &amp; I on the sidewalk where we were standing.&#160;Rob went over to the brick side of Planned Parenthood to be with Dan &amp; Addision to counsel &amp; to pray.&#160; Maryann had prayed &amp; had left.&#160; I asked the passenger, who was in the truck, if I could help them in any way.&#160; He spitted out the window &amp; said "no thank you".&#160; Just then a older women who was on a bicycle came over to us &amp; stopped.&#160; She was very strange to say the least &amp; I say that in love but with good discernment.&#160; She challenged Martha &amp; I.&#160; Martha said to her that she was concerned that she was crossing the street without really looking both ways &amp; she didn't want her to get hit by a car.&#160; She told Martha that she was capable of crossing the street &amp; asked if the beer truck had given her a beer.&#160; Martha said that she doesn't drink to which the woman stated "it figures" &amp; was starting to ride away &amp; as she passed by me I said to her "but I do".&#160; He face twisted.&#160; Off she went to the brick side of the Planned Parenthood building where the&#160;men were &amp; stopped her bike, &amp; was&#160;tslking to them.&#160; Later I asked what she had said to them &amp; Dan said that she told them that it wasn't any of their business to be out there &amp; that it was up to the woman &amp; not the man, to have an abortion.&#160; Dan had set her straight &amp; told her that it takes a man&#160;&amp; a woman to make a baby &amp; that&#160;it was also their issue too.&#160; Off she went &amp; it had crossed my mind that she was post abortive &amp; I prayed that she would return so that I could give her some post abortive literature to help her for she was a mess, no offense.&#160; My prayer was answered for she came back about an hour later &amp; Martha was in the center at this time.&#160; She stopped &amp; I asked her if she was post abortive &amp; I had some literature in my hand to give to her.&#160; She looked at me with her dark &amp; distant eyes &amp; said "oh is that what they're calling it now a days".&#160; I answered back "yes".&#160; I asked her what she had said to the gentlemen who were over on the other side of the sidewalk &amp; she said that she told them it was none of their business.&#160; I said that it takes two to make a baby &amp; not just one&#160;&amp; I went on &amp; then all of a sudden she rode like the wind down the street &amp; disappeared at Gibbs St.. I put the brochure that I was going to hand to her back into the literature box &amp; felt sad that she was not open to the Truth &amp; maybe that I did a bad job in conveying help for her, though I don't think that she was open&#160;to the Truth at this time.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that she will come back again at another time &amp; I or someone else can help her.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><span style="font-size: small"><font face="Arial"><div>&#160;</div></font></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: small"><div><span style="font-size: medium">The wind was blowing so hard that the signs were moving in the wind &amp;

Also, the literature box fell down &amp; all the Truth packets &amp; literature dumped out of the box TWICE, what a mess.&#160;&#160;I don't ever remember this happening before.&#160; I got through it, through the grace of God.&#160;

I am so happy that he will be with us on Thursday afternoons&#160;this summer until school starts back up again in September.&#160; As he was talking into the mega phone speaking to the people in Planned Parenthood a man came walking down the street holding a can of iced tea, but in this case it was a can of booze, for he smelled like it.&#160; He was pleasant &amp; wanted to stand with us to protest until he had to go to the bus terminal to pick up his son.&#160; He took a sign &amp; put the can down on the wooden ledge by the bushes.&#160; He was in the street &amp; I told him to get back on the sidewalk where he will be safe &amp; legal.&#160; He talked about the injustice of abortion &amp; how he likes to defend the environment too.&#160; The environment doesn't need defending it needs to&#160;be taken care of, the babies need defending.&#160; It might have&#160; been the liquor talking.&#160; He said that he believed in the Morning After Pill.&#160; I then educated him on what that pill does at sometimes by causing an early abortion &amp; we don't believe in that.&#160; He held the sign&#160;for the cars driving by to see&#160;for about 15 minutes &amp; then said that he had to go pickup his son.&#160; We said "good bye" &amp; thanked him for his peaceful protest &amp; wished him a happy Father's Day too.&#160; He smiled &amp; off he went, without his ice tea can, walking&#160;down the street to go pickup his son, if this was true at all.&#160; He seemed lost in away &amp; I'm sure that he has a 'story to tell'.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;<br />
I was told, on&#160;Wednesday&#160;by one of our clients, that her cousin, who is in her second trimester was going to go to abortionist Morris Wortman, in Brighton for a second trimester abortion.&#160; I gave our client, who is due at the end of this month, everything I could give her,lots of &#160;literature &amp; a graphic DVD called the 'Silent Scream' &amp; a Growth &amp;&#160;Development DVD too, to take with her to give to this abortion minded mother &amp; to talk her out of keeping the appointment to abort her precious baby. I prayed for this mother, along with our client.&#160; Well I called our client this afternoon&#160;&amp; she said that after she spoke with her cousin &amp; showed her what I gave her, which was effective to convince her, &amp; through the grace of God, she has decided to&#160;keep her baby &amp; not go to abortionist Morris Wortman, for the abortion.&#160;Praise God!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">It was now about 5pm &amp; Rob had to go.&#160; Suzanne had left at 4:30pm.&#160; Martha &amp; I were in the center &amp; I was&#160;making up more Truth packets &amp; she was busy putting away children's clothes along with Paul who was still with us.&#160; God bless him.&#160; He finally left to go home &amp; Martha &amp; I had supper together &amp; then headed over to Mercy High School to hear Dr. Janet Smith speak, in person.&#160; After her talk&#160;I went up to her to meet her &amp; to shake her hand.&#160;&#160;It was an honor to have&#160;met Dr. Janet Smith, <a href="http://www.janetsmith.excerptsofinri.com/"><span style="color: #ff0000">http://www.janetsmith.excerptsofinri.com</span>/</a>&#160;</span></span><span style="font-size: medium">, who is such a wonderful, knowledgeable&#160;woman.&#160; I introduced myself to her as a director of a Pregnancy Center &amp; also that I sidewalk counseled in front of Planned Parenthood.

I greeted Martha &amp; she said that new that I sleep late &amp; she had to go early&#160;to bring her friend to the doctors to get a heart monitor put on&#160;&amp; she doesn't have a cell phone so she couldn't call me to tell me that she wasn't going to be at Mass at noon.&#160; I was so glad to see her when I arrived at the center.&#160;&#160;There was so much to do in the center putting&#160;away our donations so I said to Martha that maybe we should put the things away, since Paul wasn't her to do it &amp; then&#160;go out to the front lines later this&#160;afternoon.&#160; She agreed.&#160; As we were working Sandy came, who has come on Tuesdays for the past 2 years to help us.&#160; She gave us the news that she got a car &amp; a job working in food service at the Strong Museum.&#160; I was happy for her but sad&#160;for us at Focus.&#160; She said that she would try to&#160;come after work on occasion to help us &amp; to see us.&#160;

put away children's clothes, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; We all had a great time together working &amp; talking &amp; eating.&#160; I made lunch &amp; for desert we had Martha's homemade chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting &amp; I wonder why I haven't lost any weight!!!&#160;&#160; I was happy that all the bags &amp; boxes, of children clothes,&#160;were empty now.&#160;&#160;We were given a crib &amp; Martha call the company to see if there was&#160;a recall on the crib.&#160; The woman on the phone said it was 22 years old&#160;&amp; to throw it out, which we did.&#160; Paul came by later to help us &amp; he put&#160;the crib&#160;in the dumpster, which is in the back of the center.&#160;If something is&#160;not safe it goes.&#160; We take no chances at the Focus Center with the safety of our children.&#160; Safety is&#160;out priory!!&#160;</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Sandy had left &amp; so did Carole, around 3pm, so I said to Martha "lets&#160;now go out to the front lines to pray &amp; to witness".&#160; She said "yes, lets&#160;go".&#160; She we did.&#160; We took&#160;two graphic signs, the mega phone, the literature box &amp; of course the poster of our Mother, Our Lady of Guadeloupe with us.&#160; It didn't take long for the evil to show its ugly head.&#160; I found, on the ground in front of the business next to Planned Parenthood, an empty package of&#160;Plan B, which is the Morning After Pill with Planned Parenthood instructions with it.&#160; The package was empty, so the young had taken the two pills, &amp; thrown the package away.&#160; This particular&#160;'killing&#160;pill' is for girls from&#160;17 &amp; under.&#160; My heart ached that a young girl had taken the two pills &amp; off she went as if nothing was going to happen to her.&#160; These pills are potent steroids &amp; something will happen to her &amp; if she was pregnant it will kill her baby too.&#160; What monsters, you are, &#160;Planned Parenthood .&#160; Girls please wake up!!!&#160;&#160;&#160;Martha picked up the empty package with the instructions &amp; put it in out literature box for us to bring it into the center later on.&#160; I have a whole file of Planned Parenthood 'trash'.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha went to&#160;the center to give Cleveland, our street friend, some food so I was alone at this time.&#160; I saw at the fence that the death escort&#160;Barry Swan was talking to a man &amp; a woman so I started to talk to them too.&#160; Well this man was no gentleman &amp; he gave me hid middle finger so I&#160; said to him "don't show mw your IQ for your the one at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Just then he came closer to the fence &amp; was staring to pull down his paint to show me his other&#160;IQ.&#160; I said to me "you better&#160;stop right now for I have other&#160;who did this arrested, I'll take&#160;down you license number too.&#160; He quickly pulled his pants back up,&#160;good decision mister, &amp; he got into his car with&#160;the woman that&#160; he was with him.&#160; I hurried to get a piece of paper &amp; a pen but I couldn't find&#160;a pen in the literature box &amp; just then I remembered that I now have a cell phone&#160;that can take pictures.&#160; Hurrah!!&#160;&#160; As he was driving out I took his picture &amp; the license plate number too, to&#160;which the woman in the car gave me her middle finger, as they drove off.&#160; What did I say to them but the Truth, which was very convicting to both of them that's for sure.&#160; Come Holy Spirit come......&#160; I hope that they repent!&#160;&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha was now back with me on the sidewalk &amp; was staring to pray the Rosary.&#160; Just then I head a loud voice from down the street all the way to the corner of University Ave. &amp; Gibbs St. a males voice that said "shut up you .......".&#160; I said that I loved him &amp; that I hope that he repents from his sins &amp; that he didn't respect women or himself either"&#160; He disappeared around the corner&#160;along with the other male that was walking with him.&#160; At least he was silent.&#160; War is Hell.</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">We hadn't been on the front line for more than 10 minutes when this all came down.&#160; What evil it is when people decide to have their precious baby killed, so that they can live as they want too.&#160; This is from Mother Teresa, a great &amp; humble woman.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha decided to pray &amp; witness across the street so I was by myself on the side of&#160;the sidewalk where the bushes are.&#160; One of the workers drove out wearing purple scrubs.&#160; I asked her to stop murdering babies.&#160; I noticed that she was driving into our parking lot where our center is located.&#160; I walked over to see where she was going, maybe it was to the Focus Center, you never know.&#160; Read the former director of Planned Parenthood, Abby Johnson's book.&#160; But in this case she got out of her car &amp; went into Assemblyman's David Gant's office.&#160; Poor choice!!!&#160; She was in there for about 3 minutes &amp; then left.&#160; As she was at the corner of University Ave. &amp; Gibbs St.&#160; I offered her a Truth packet but she drove away.&#160; She is a 'new face' at Planned Parenthood, hopefully not for long.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that she will get a job, in her medical experience, in saving lives &amp; not talking lives.&#160; That's just plain sick.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha hollered over to me from across the street that Pat, our grandmother &amp; great grandmother of 4 children was turning into the Focus parking lot.&#160; I went over to the parking lot to greet her &amp; to let her into the center.&#160; Just then Paul reappeared &amp; I asked him if he could please stay with Martha while I was in the center with Pat.&#160; He said that he would.&#160; Pat &amp; I had a great talk &amp; she was able to be blessed with some nice things, for her great grand children,&#160;that we just received including a pink day bed with side rails for little Akira, my Godchild.&#160; She will be so happy in her new princess bed.&#160; </font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">The doorbell rang &amp; it was a very pregnant young girl asking to get some baby things.&#160;She was blessed with many nice things for her precious baby boy who will be born soon.&#160; She's thinking of naming him David or Michael, from the Bible.&#160; Great!!&#160; The doorbell rang again &amp; it was another mom that needed clothes for her children.&#160; It's blessing to bless others!!</font></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium"><font face="Arial">Martha &amp;

When we arrived at the center we were greeted by two young girls &amp; one of the girls had her&#160;6 years old son with her, what a cutie he was.&#160;&#160;The other young girl wanted a pregnancy test, which Martha gave.&#160;The other young woman went into the Material Aid Room &amp; got some nice things for her son.&#160; He got some nice toys &amp; was so happy :)&#160; We had so much to do at the center that we never got out on the front lines this afternoon, which breaks my heart.&#160;The doorbell never stopped ringing.&#160; Tim came to fix the cabinet in the Material Aid Room that the hinges were falling off the doors.&#160; This is the cabinet that we put out signs &amp; literature box &amp; mega phone in plus other supplies there to.&#160; We also have a shelf that he made more sturdy so that things that we put on it won't fall off.&#160; He did a great job.&#160; His daughter will be having open heart surgery this September.&#160; He &amp; his wife Molly &amp; his family are in our prayers.&#160; Then the doorbell rang again &amp; it was Frank bringing a large donation of big items to the center.&#160; I called for Tickabo, working in the taxi company to help carry the things into the center &amp; to bring them into the Great Room.&#160; There was an old fashioned carriage, probably worth about $100 or more.&#160; A wickered bassinet, baby gates,&#160;two bouncers&#160;&amp; so many more items for our mothers.&#160; Frank hurried out door he had to go somewhere else &amp; Tim was nice enough to help us set up the antique baby carriage, that we probably will try to sell on Craig's list, to help pay our rent, so that we can&#160;continue to assist our moms &amp; their children at Focus.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">Martha &amp; I sat down briefly to eat a fast lunch.&#160; The doorbell rang again &amp; it was&#160;a young mom with her precious baby, in a stroller,&#160;needing some diapers &amp; more clothes for her lovely baby daughter.&#160; I went outside to get something from my car&#160;&amp; a man came walking up to the front&#160;door.&#160; I asked if he needed any assistance &amp; he told me that his girlfriend was in the center getting baby clothes for their daughter.&#160; Okay Dad come on in.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">The doorbell rang again &amp; it was Bruno bringing in some donations from Our Lady of the Americas church on East Main St.&#160;which is&#160;about a half a mile down the street from the center.&#160; He said that he's busy studying to became a Deacon.&#160; He has three more years of study.&#160; God be with you &amp; your family Bruno.&#160; What great news this was that's for sure.&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">The doorbell rang &amp; it was the carpet cleaning man.&#160; He came to give us an estimate to what it would cost to clean the carpet with all it's water stains on it from all the backed up rain water that happened this past rainy Springtime.&#160; He looked around &amp; gave Martha &amp; I an estimate.&#160; I called Bernie &amp; he spoke with him for a few minutes &amp; then hung up.&#160; He stayed for a few more minutes &amp; then left.&#160; He was nice &amp; I'm sure that his company was good but Bernie has another plan.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">About 20 minutes later the doorbell didn't ring, for Bernie, the landlord, has his own key to get in.&#160; We discussed with him about the carpet &amp; he said that $150 was to much for the carpet to be cleaned.&#160; He has another plan to get it done.&#160; I'm certainly&#160;not going to&#160;worry about for this, for it&#160;is his responsibility &amp; he will come through for Focus.&#160; Martha reminded him that we have a Mass in the Great Room in 2 weeks&#160;&amp; we'd like the place to look good &amp; smell good too.&#160; He went, to fix the toilet,&#160; with Martha's assistance.&#160;He had to&#160;put the sealer around the toilet, in the Great Room bathroom, where we store in secure bags, our winter baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; He also has&#160;two more other projects that he will did, one tomorrow &amp; the other on Saturday.&#160; Thanks for coming, to fix what needs to be fixed Bernie, to make this place a better place for&#160;us &amp; our clients.&#160; </span></span></div></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">I went into the office to make up some Truth packets &amp; to do some other office work when the doorbell rang again &amp; this time it was Tucker.&#160; He was sick last week so he wasn't on the front lines praying.&#160; H e felt better today &amp; was here.&#160; We talked for a little while before he took his sign, with the three babies on it&#160;&amp; his chair &amp; went out to be on the sidewalk to pray&amp; witness for 'life'.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">I went back to the office to continue to make up some more Truth packets &amp; the doorbell rang again &amp; this time it was Cleveland, our street friend.&#160; He was hungry &amp; Martha fixed him up a nice meal.&#160; He sat on his favorite chair &amp; ate his macaroni &amp; cheese dinner.&#160; Mmmmm good!!&#160; I then went back to the office &amp; made up about 6 Truth packets when the doorbell rang again &amp; it was Memo, our Data Entry man.&#160; He came to get our receipts &amp; the Material Aid Room writ in sheets, that we ask the girls &amp; women to fill out when they first come in to get the free baby &amp; children clothes &amp; small items.&#160; We also discussed some other things too.&#160; He was there about 20 minutes &amp; he had to go.&#160; We are so grateful for all the help that he has given us over the past 2 years.&#160; We also appreciate everyone who helps us out at Focus with their time &amp; talents.&#160; God bless you all...................</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">I was again in the office when the doorbell rang again.&#160; I heard Pat's voice &amp; Martha was saying to me "Mary there is a surprise for you".&#160; I was just starting to get up from my desk when the brood came walking in.&#160; There was Pat, the grandmother - great grandmother &amp; her granddaughter Katherine &amp; her two sons.&#160; One of the sons was almost killed by the Ru486 drug&#160; 2 years ago.&#160;This baby was saved by the grace of God by God using us at Focus to take her to&#160;our doctor who took the deadly pills out of her cervix &amp; the baby was saved from death, by Planned Parenthood's abortionist Rachael Phelps.&#160;This was such a wonderful surprise to say the least!&#160; It was Katherine's, the mom of the 2 sons, Birthday tomorrow, for she'll be 18 years old.&#160; We all talked for awhile &amp; we gave them the wicker bassinet for her other granddaughter is due at the end of July with another daughter.&#160; They also took two of the door gates &amp; a toy horse for Kymeir, the boy that was almost killed by Planned Parenthood.&#160;They also took the baby bouncer &amp; a toy car &amp; a couple of things for Akira who was born 1 lib. 7 ozs. 2 years this July &amp; who is also my Godchild.&#160; The picture of me holding her will be on our new brochure, when Leanne finishes it.&#160; It is such a great picture of me smiling&#160;holding&#160;Akira&#160;as she's looking right into the camera.&#160; She's not shy!!&#160; But I am.&#160; They packed everything in the van &amp; off they went.&#160; I've know Pat &amp; her family for over 2 years now since she first stopped at Planned Parenthood seeking help.&#160; What a wonderful woman, Pat is,&#160;to say the least.&#160; What a blessing it is for me to know her &amp; her family.&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium">Martha went back working in the Material Aid Room putting away the clothes that we just received so I decided to get supper ready.&#160; It was around 6:30pm so I thought that Dan wasn't coming for supper &amp; to do some odd &amp; ends at Focus, so we decided to eat.&#160; We thought that after supper we would go to the Thrift Shop to get Cleveland some pants &amp; a shirt, so that was the plan.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; it was Dan.&#160; I said to him that we had just finished our supper &amp; that we were planning to go to the store to buy some things &amp; the store closed at 8pm, though it wasn't to far away from the center.&#160; He said "no problem".&#160; I fixed him up a plate of lasagna&#160; &amp; salad &amp; he was a happy camper.&#160; I then gave him hi assignments to which he was most cooperative in accepting.&#160; He is another&#160;blessing from God to us at Focus.&#160; Martha &amp; hurried out to go to the Thrift Store to get there in time to look around &amp; to find something for our street friend Cleveland.&#160; I hope that Martha when she was later on going to Wegmans to buy a bar of Irish Spring for his long anticipated shower.&#160; How can he be so fussy about soap???&#160; I guess he has a right to use the soap of his choice, after all, he's the one taking the shower.&#160;&#160; At the&#160;store we got a nice pair of pants &amp;&#160; a shirt , for Cleveland &amp; Martha&#160;got a pair of sunglasses &amp; I got a turquoise blouse &amp; pearls &amp; two candle holders&#160;

Paul brought out&#160; signs. Rain had been forecast, but the weather was fine all morning.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">A man came out of Planned Parenthood after a brief visit to see a worker friend. He is pro-life, and took&#160; a packet to read and show his friends.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Next two pro-life women came out with birth control in their bags. They also took a packet, and I directed them particularly to the “birth control” pamphlets, to read about the abortive nature of the pill. They go to PP just because everyone does, and&#160; it’s there.&#160; They were&#160; surprised to hear that the abortionist is a pediatrician, trained to nurture the life of children, and yet she is killing them. I asked them to pray for those of us trying to stop this slaughter at PP, and urged them to find a good doctor.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">Several more packets were given out….all the recipients agreed to pray for us,&#160; and I will pray for them.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">A Muslim man walking, stopped to chat. He did not take a packet, but will pray on his own prayer beads for the success of our efforts outside PP. He agrees that abortion must cease, and felt the root of the problem is that men don’t want to take responsibility for&#160; the children they make, so they pressure the mothers to “get rid of them”. The mothers are confused and are afraid to go it alone. I told him about Focus, and the help and moral support we can provide. He&#160; will pass the message on to his friends.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">&#160;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium">I called out to a man smoking outside PP, urging him to call his friend on her cell&#160; phone and ask her to stop.&#160; Please don’t kill her son or daughter.&#160; He didn’t listen. Later he came out and I asked him again to try to stop her. He looked at me. We at Focus can help, I told him. God has a plan for every human life that is conceived. He went back in. An hour later they both came out and sat on the bench.&#160; It was done, and couldn’t be undone. Now they will have to live with the guilt the rest of their lives. I told them of Project Rachel. After resting fifteen minutes on the bench, they&#160; walked away down the street.

She had to go so I said that I would call her soon to&#160;find out&#160;more about her overseas vacation in London.&#160; After Sheila left then Mary Ann had to go too.&#160; Paul brought out the signs &amp; a few minutes later Rob came &amp; took the mega phone &amp; a bag of Truth packets over to the brick side of Planned Parenthood to pray &amp; to counsel &amp; to witness the Truth, to the people going into Planned Parenthood &amp;&#160;to&#160;those people&#160;driving by too.&#160;

What is this??&#160; He received a letter from our attorney about a year ago which says that if he continues to harass us we will sue him.&#160; Not here he goes again.&#160; Then the guy Jim Martin, who lives in the first condo was in his upper window video taping us on the sidewalk for about an hour &amp; a half.&#160; What with that.&#160; He just received a letter from my attorney about 3 weeks ago stating the same thing that if he doesn't stop harassing us on the sidewalk that we will sue.&#160; They are proving that they are not afraid of being sued.&#160; Their harassment is distracting us in doing what we're called to do out on the front lines &amp; that is to try to save &amp; change lives for Christ.&#160; I called my attorney &amp; hopefully she'll get back to me tomorrow regarding Mutt &amp;

Since they are available at places of pilgrimage it makes Catholics automatically think they are fine to use.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #800000"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">These rosaries are considered New Age due to their demonic symbolism. For example, if you look closely behind the figure of Christ there is a caduceus, which is an upright pole, representing mediation between Heaven and earth. This pole is an ancient herald’s wand that was carried by messenger gods like Hermes or Mercury. The rod is also a divining rod to measure the earth and its energies of power.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #800000"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Satan is shown behind the figure of Christ and is depicted by a coiled serpent, which represents latent power, concealed but not yet fully manifest, a dormant power. It may also represent to Satanists that the devil is Co-Messianic, Redeemer and Mediator with Christ. The circles on the crucifix are from Egyptian Graeco-Roman, Phoenician, Baal symbols called the Pentagram, which is a major occult sign.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #800000"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The pentagrams have five points, which represent spirit, fire, earth, water, and air. The pentagram at the bottom is upside down and represents the devil’s goat. The four circles with dots in the center signify gold or the sun in alchemy.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #800000"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">These rosaries cannot be cleansed through prayer because they were created for the purpose of evil.

wife in with their little baby.&#160; They were from the Congo &amp; the man had had his right arm chopped off in the war there.&#160; Very nice people &amp; they took many nice things &amp; some&#160;big things too.&#160; Thank God that Carole was now here helping me out with the clients &amp; so was Paul.&#160; I had asked Tickaboo, from the taxi company, to put up the ceiling tile in the ceiling, for there was none.&#160; I was so grateful to him for that.&#160; So later on when Bernie, the landlord,&#160;came in he didn't have to do it.&#160; He was glad &amp; he told me that he was going to go buy more ceiling titles for when we need them in the future.&#160;
