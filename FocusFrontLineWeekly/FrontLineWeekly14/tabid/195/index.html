out of the abortion mill.&#160; When will they wake up &amp; get their lives on track before they can't.&#160; The deeper you fall in the pit, the&#160;harder it is&#160;to get out.&#160; It saddens my heart, that's for sure.&#160; The first girl as she drove out of the parking lot waved at me sort of mockingly &amp; the other girl gave me a double bird &amp; the young Black man gave me his IQ too.&#160; I told them that knowledge is power &amp; that you can't go any lower than to be her for there isn't a place that lower than Planned Parenthood.&#160; I usually offer then help when I call out &amp; I tell then the Truth &amp; to repent, etc..&#160;

I went to the center after Mass this afternoon &amp; worked there all afternoon.&#160;&#160; We saw clients &amp; helped them out with children's clothes &amp; diapers.&#160;I had gone over to Mack's next door &amp; asked him if he had my DVD burned for me &amp; I bumped into Janet, who is on our Board of Directors though she not productive at Focus &amp; didn't make the last meeting.&#160; So I asked to speak with her &amp; she said that she would stop over in a few minutes, which she did.&#160; I offered her a seat &amp; then I asked her if she still wanted to be on the Board of Directors at Focus or not &amp; if she did she had to be more productive at Focus, for that's only fair &amp; that's what it's all about is to be pro active in the center's well being &amp; to have it flourish for our clients.&#160;She then decided before she left that it would be best to resign &amp; I accepted.&#160; We left in good terms for she is to busy to be productive at the center &amp; we need people that are.&#160; She gave me a hug &amp; we said "good bye" with no heavy hearts.&#160;After she left I asked Martha&#160;if she would&#160;call the young man that she spoke with last Thursday evening that called the center's phone number &amp; asked if we did abortions.&#160;I initially spoke with him &amp; he hung up on me when I told him that we do not refer for abortions &amp; that we could help him &amp; for him to be a 'life saver'.&#160; Then I asked Martha if she would call him on Friday &amp; she said that she would &amp; she did.&#160; She told me that he told her that he was calling for his buddy that got his girlfriend pregnant.&#160; Martha offered him help to pass onto his friend's girlfriend, then he hung up.&#160; I was thinking of him today so I asked Martha if she would call him to see if we could help again in this situation &amp; hopefully get some good news that his friend's girlfriend won't have her precious baby be&#160;killed.&#160;&#160;Martha left a message on his voice mail &amp; he never called back.&#160;&#160; Not good news that's for sure.&#160; This is a throw away society where if you don't want your child you can pay to have him or her killed by the local abortionist.&#160; Fast &amp; easy, you think,&#160;but it will haunt you for the rest of your life, don't you know!!&#160; After the phone call&#160;Martha &amp; I stopped to have an egg &amp; olive sandwich for our lunch.&#160; Then the office phone rang.&#160; I got up to get the phone when a female voice was on the other end asking if this was a doctor's office.&#160; I said that it wasn't thinking that she just got the wrong number but I was so wrong.&#160; Then she asked me if we were an abortion facility.&#160; I quickly responded "no, we are not for abortion kills the baby &amp; that we help mothers here".&#160; She hung up on me.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; Just then I received a call from our newest volunteer&#160; telling me that she received so many nice things from her employer &amp; that she would like to write a 'thank you' letter for her generosity.&#160; I was so distraught from the last phone call that I couldn't concentrate on this call so I apologized to our newest friend &amp; said that I would see her tomorrow at the center &amp; said goodbye &amp; hung up.&#160; I asked Martha if she could retrieve the phone number of the last call for she has a phone just like this one at home &amp; she does it there but she couldn't do it here.&#160; I then went to ask our account up the hall if he could &amp; he couldn't &amp; he suggested to me to call Time Warner Cable Company which I did.&#160; They said that they would need a court order to give me that number.&#160; I said that this was life or death &amp; the operator seemed to understand &amp; he was very sensitive to my request &amp; my noticeable pain, on the phone.&#160; He said that he was sorry &amp; he hoped that everything will work out well.&#160; I said to him that I hoped it will too &amp; I said "thank you" &amp; then hung up the phone.&#160; I then took hold of the phone &amp; prayed that I could figure out how to retrieve the number of the last caller &amp; to my amazement I did.&#160; I know that it was my Guardian Angel who found it for me.&#160; I was very upset to say the least &amp; I asked Martha, my faithful&#160;co director if she would make the call &amp; she did.&#160; She got the woman on the phone &amp; told her that we were a pregnancy center &amp; that we could help her.&#160; She hung up on dear Martha.&#160;&#160;Martha called her right back &amp; the nasty woman said that she would call the police for harassment.&#160; God figure lady, your planning a murder &amp; your bothered about someone helping you not to commit this crime against God &amp; your child.&#160; You're nuts to say the least &amp; so are the women that think this way too.&#160; Society is so toppsy turvery, when evil appears to be good &amp; good appears to be evil, like the Bible says. &#160;What's wrong with women today that they are trying to find someone to kill their own baby??&#160; They're hiring a hit man, searching someone out to pay,&#160;to have their very own son or daughter murdered in cold blood.&#160; How hideous &amp; heartless!!!&#160; No matter what your situation is you never solve the problem with having your child killed..... it's always evil.&#160;

saw the smiles on their faces.&#160; It's so worth it!!&#160; We did have this one unpleasant&#160;experience with one of our regular clients.&#160; We have to be careful that we are not duped, that's not what we're all about.&#160; We pray for discernment. She&#160;is an older woman with this man that she brings with her.&#160; He just stands there &amp; doesn't say to much &amp; is much younger than her.&#160; She said that she was pregnant about 4 months ago &amp; she came in looking the same.&#160; We offered her a pregnancy test which she refused. She filled one bag up &amp; then asked for another bag theat's when I flipped.&#160; I then confronted her by saying "you're not pregnant so&#160;stop making this up".&#160; I restricted her in what she could take from the Material Aid Room. I've never seen her children, if she has any at all.&#160; When she talks about them the ages are always&#160;different, like she can't remember their ages?&#160; What is that all about?&#160; I don't know if she gets what she wants &amp; then sells the items or what, for she's nt being honest with Martha or I.&#160; We can't tolerate dishonesty at the center.&#160; I left the room &amp; then Martha took over the situation until the woman &amp; man left.&#160; It's always a challenge to run the center with interiority.&#160; We are not saps so don't try to pull one over on us for we have the Holy Spirit.

our tickets for the subway.&#160;  We were now entering the church for the prayers before we go.&#160; I was interviewed  by the reporter at the Catholic Courier, a local Catholic newspaper here in  Rochester, NY,&#160;who was assigned to go with us on the bus to DC.&#160; After the  prayers I went to my car to get my heavier boots for I was told that it was  going to rain in Washington for the march.&#160; I didn't want my feet to get wet so  I opted for the heavy boots that I knew were waterproof.&#160; I brought my umbrella  too&#160;but I left it at the&#160;Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.&#160;It figures but  no big deal for I can buy another for $5.00 at the Dollar General.&#160; All a board  we were now entering the bus.&#160; I picked the seat &amp; I wish that I didn't for  there was two ladies across from Martha &amp; I who were taking &amp; knitting  with the light on all night long.&#160; I said something on several occasions but to  no avail did I much sleep on the way down to DC.&#160;

the other 47 passengers on the bus,  as it traveled from 10pm to 6am, in the dark &amp; cold of winter.&#160;&#160;I did  finally put in my ear plugs but they really didn't work very well for these  women had good &amp; hardy voices especially when they laughed.&#160; We finally  arrived at the Basilica, in Washington, DC &amp; the first thing that Martha  &amp; I did was to go to the 'real' bathroom to freshen up &amp; to brush our  teeth.&#160; We then&#160;made our way to the Basilica &amp; got a seat towards the  front.&#160; Archbishop Timothy Dolan of New York was to be the celebrant of the  Mass.&#160; He will be a Cardinal in February, Praise God!!&#160;

eggs &amp; water &amp; skim milk.&#160; I had a potato has  brown but it was cooked to much so I didn't eat that but otherwise it was a good  &amp; hardy meal.&#160; I was happy to see form afar my friend Sister Joseph Maria, a  Dominican sister.&#160; She was so happy &amp; she looked so good.&#160; I asked for her  prayers &amp; she said that she would pray for me &amp; all who are on the Front  Lines of the abortion mill Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said "thank you sister &amp;  you have my prayers too".&#160; We said "good bye " &amp; Martha &amp; I were on our  way to the streets of DC.&#160; We decided not to travel with the Rochester group but  to go it alone, for we are independent women.&#160; We took the subway but got off a  little to soon for we had to walk an extra mile because of that mistake but it  was okay.&#160; We saw the motor cave of either the President or the Vice President,  on Pennsylvania Ave.&#160;

Before I went into Focus I went over to the front lines because I saw a red car drive into the parking lot &amp; it parked by the fence where I could call out to the girl that just got out of the car.&#160; I said what I said to her as she walked into the Killing Mill, she did turn around to see who was talking to her, though.&#160; I saw that there was a man with glasses in the car.&#160; I tried to talk to&#160;him for a while &amp; then I&#160;went back into the center to put the donations of clothes &amp; things away &amp; to assist our clients, along with Martha.&#160; My heart was still thinking of the front lines &amp; especially of the girl in the red car.&#160; Our first client came in with her rambunctious 2 year old daughter, who said everything was "hers".&#160; She was so fast moving &amp; I had to get her out of my office &amp; the hallway, in the Great Room.&#160; I haven't seen her daughter in awhile because when she does comes to Focus she's usually alone.&#160; I remember her when she was just born &amp; in a stroller &amp; look at her now!&#160; Soooo cute!!&#160; After she left another client came in with her son &amp; her friend.&#160; The friend needed food &amp; she went into the Great Room &amp; she was nice enough to arrange our food shelf &amp; said that she'll come back to help us out.&#160; That'll be great &amp; thank you so much, for we do need help, at our center.&#160; Then after they left&#160;a husband &amp; wife came to get food from our Food Shelves &amp; Martha was nice enough to give them our Referral Aid Sheet &amp; called the St.Theodore's Church food cupboard, so that they can go to it tomorrow, to get food.&#160;They were very appreciated for the assistance that&#160;Martha gave them.&#160; We were blessed, with a monetary gift from St. Pius Tenth Church, &amp;

We were very busy &amp; I spent another hour there before I went back outside with the literature box &amp; a graphic sign.&#160; The red car was still there &amp; I again talked to the man with the glasses who was in the car.&#160; It was difficult to see that some one wasn't interested in the Truth to get help for&#160;the young girl that he brought in.&#160; It was almost three hours later when she came out &amp; she just looked straight ahead when they left.&#160; I call&#160;it the death look', which is when the person has a far away look in their eyes.&#160; As the car passed by me I asked her not to chop up her precious baby on Thursday, the surgical abortion day.&#160; Lord have Mercy!!&#160; I stayed out on the front lines, for about 30 minutes,&#160;as the police &amp; the fire truck passed by me as I was praying for their safety.&#160; Where is the safety for the person in the womb???&#160; I also handed out a Truth packet to a young girl that passed by me as she was entering the Death Camp.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she reads the material &amp; that it will educate her &amp; change her life, which it's suppose to do, if the person who receives it is open to the Truth.&#160; I called out to a man who was getting into his car &amp; he called back&#160;over to me saying "I don't believe in abortion".&#160; I said that's great but Planned Parenthood does.&#160; I offered him a Truth packet&#160; &amp; a informational DVD, as he was leaving the parking lot, &amp; he was nice enough to stop &amp; to take it.&#160; The car window didn't&#160;open so I had to open up the car door to put it on the seat &amp; then I invited him to come out to join us on the front lines.&#160; I said that there was a black Pastor who come out on Thursdays from 2 to 5pm &amp; then he said "it doesn't make a difference" &amp; I responded "no it doesn't for God made us all".&#160; The said 'thank you' &amp; then drove off.&#160; &#160;I do think that having someone of&#160;the Black Race,&#160;does make a difference, out on the Front Lines, though.&#160; Planned Parenthood does target the Black Race &amp; the girls would rather have some one from their Race talk to them than from the White Race, I imagine.&#160; Not always though.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>I saw that Planned Parenthood had an old woman as the Death Escort today.&#160;

that it kills babies early on in the pregnancy.&#160; I then said "no sex before marriage", to which he replied "I'm married &amp; have four children" to which I replied "if you're married then you must be open to new life &amp; let God be God".&#160; He walked away from me &amp; was heading back to the abortion mill.&#160; I said, as he was walking away from me "birth control will destroy your marriage &amp; then what will happen to your children"?&#160; How sad that people don't want the Truth but I hope that what I said to him, will&#160;resonate, in his heart &amp; mind.&#160; He walked pretty close to me so I reached into my pocket &amp; I got out my cell phone, to intimate him.&#160; He did say "don't talk to me" &amp; I said back to him "this is still America &amp; I have Freedom of Speech".&#160;&#160; Then I saw that a truck had driven into the parking lot &amp; it was the Physician Sales&#160;&amp;

After he left I stayed about 5 more minutes more, for&#160;a young mother came out to the front lines, to get me to help her out in the center.&#160; Martha had gone to Wendy's to get lunch for us.&#160; The taxi man, who has an office in the same building where the center is located told her that I was out on the sidewalk.&#160; I then left the front lines to go to assist her &amp; her friend,&#160;in the center.&#160; On the way she told me that last week she had dropped off some clothes to the center.&#160; I said "thank you so much, that was very nice of you, &amp; we certainly appreciate it".&#160; We arrived to the center &amp;

I got up from the table &amp; got her soap &amp; one roll of toilet paper.&#160; She was so grateful.&#160; I got to talk to her &amp; found out that she was interested in the Catholic faith, so I got her a couple of educational CD's &amp; a two booklets to take with her to educate her about the Catholic faith.&#160; She said "thank you" &amp; went on her way.&#160; I rejoined Martha, for lunch&#160;&amp; I finished up my grilled chicken sandwich.&#160;&#160;I was so proud of myself because I refused Martha's French Fries.&#160;

two young girls with a baby in a carry all came out of the  car &amp; walked into Planned Parenthood to have this precious baby be killed.&#160;  How horrible!!&#160; She had the support of her boyfriend &amp; had seen the pictures  of what she was going to do to her own baby &amp; she went in there to do it.&#160;  She even brought the baby's brother or sister with her to the crime of abortion.

She went through with the murder.&#160; It was  about 15 minutes later when a car pulled into the parking lot &amp; a young girl  got out &amp; she ran into the building.&#160; The mother of the girl got out of her  car so I started to speak to her.&#160;

I gave him the  diapers &amp; wipes &amp; then lead him to the Great Room where we have most of  the food but there wasn't very much to choose from because most of it was given  out yesterday, our most busiest day of the week, foe whatever reason.&#160; He was  grateful for some food that I was able to give to him.&#160; He also needed a job so  I knocked on the door to the taxi company &amp; I asked if they we hiring.&#160; He  said "no".&#160; I then suggested to this nice young man to go over to the restaurant  across the street to fill out an application, at least, for one never knows.&#160; He  said that this was a good idea.&#160; I was happy that he thought so &amp; off he  went.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that he will find work soon for his family sake.&#160; Lord  have Mercy!!&#160; Martha came in from the wind &amp; she said that she had to go to  the Nursing Office, of the company that she works for,&#160;to sign a Patient Report  or something &amp; that she would be back as soon as she could .&#160; Okay Martha.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Thursday, February 2, 2012 on the Front  Lines &amp; at Focus</span></strong></span></span></p><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I arrived at Focus after the Candlemas at our Lady  of Victory where Martha &amp; Suzanne &amp; I sat together.&#160; When I got there  Sheila had to go, for the Mass went later this afternoon, because it was a Mass  where the candles were lit &amp; were blessed &amp; the Eastman School of Music  were singing.&#160; I got a fast report from&#160;Sheila&#160;&amp; I said "good bye &amp;  thank you" to her.&#160; Bill was already on the front lines, sitting across the  street on his stool, witnessing with his sign &amp; Paul was there setting up  for the afternoon team before he went to lunch but&#160;he was coming back to help us  out in the center after he ate.&#160; Martha &amp; Suzanne were now at the center,  coming from Mass.&#160;It was hard for them to find a parking spot&#160;in the parking  lot, so Martha had to&#160;park out on the street, with the parking meter :(&#160; &#160;I  noticed that Karen, our new volunteer wasn't hear yet, so I gave her a fast call  on her cell phone.&#160; She came about 15 minutes later, for she lost track of the  time,&#160;because she was working at home&#160;on our revised Referral List&#160;for our  clients.&#160; Thanks Karen for you are a 'go getter'.&#160; Welcome to the Team!!&#160; When  Karen arrived she helped Paul, who was now back from lunch, in the center.&#160; Our  regular client Valerie came to&#160;help us too &amp; she brought a pac'n play with  her to give to one of our clients that needed it.&#160; Thanks Valerie how nice that  was of you :)&#160; So Suzanne, our client advocate &amp; Karen &amp; Paul &amp;  Valerie were now all in the center helping our clients &amp; making phone calls  to see how they were &amp; putting away donations too.&#160; Suzanne was orientating  Karen a little more of what we do &amp;&#160; how we do it at Focus.&#160; I went to the  front lines &amp; Martha joined me soon afterwards.&#160; Along came Addision &amp;  Dan, who just had a fender bender.&#160; Thank God that they were okay!!&#160; Then along  came Adolf &amp; Pastor Everett.

I hope not but just in case  we now have our files saved on a disc.&#160; Also Memo burned a disc of information  for our 990 Federal Form that I will give to our accountant, up the hallway from  Focus,&#160;to work on.&#160; Thanks Memo.&#160; I asked him which team he was for, for the  upcoming Super Bowl was&#160;playing this&#160;Sunday night,&#160;&amp; he said 'Go Giants'  &amp; I said "Go Giants" too.&#160; I told him that I will have a 6 pack of dark  beer, the best kind,&#160;for all his hard work that he does for us at&#160;Focus, when he  comes back again.&#160; He said that wasn't necessary but I said that it was &amp;&#160; I  won out :)</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">After he left I went back outside to join Martha  &amp; Pastor Everett, for every one else had gone.&#160; Martha said that she was  cold &amp; was going into the center.&#160; I stayed with Pastor Everett calling to  the people going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Pastor Everett &amp; Martha had  earlier, in the afternoon, talked with a young girl who had stopped her car to  tell us that she thought that we could do something different out hear rather  than screaming out to the people going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told her that  we've been&#160;out here, for a long time,&#160;&amp; this format works in saving lives,  through the grace of God.&#160; I offered her a Truth packet &amp; she said that she  knew all about that.&#160;&#160;I said back to her "if you did know,&#160;you'd not be saying  what your saying".&#160; I felt that I should just let Pastor Everett &amp; Martha  take over &amp; for me to be quiet.&#160; I then saw a young girl &amp; two guys&#160;with  a stroller, walking up the street, &amp; I quickly walked towards them &amp;  told them about Focus.&#160; The mom said "what, free diapers, where is this place."&#160;  I then directed them across the street to Focus to get diapers&amp; some nice  things for the precious baby in the stroller.&#160; I think that the young woman&#160;saw  first hand that we really mean, to help women in need with their children, &amp;  along with what Pastor Everett was saying to her &amp; Martha's love &amp;  kindness, the young girl broke down in tears.&#160;Martha held her for a few minutes  to comfort her.&#160;&#160;After she felt better she did take the Truth packet &amp; then  left.&#160;Martha told me what had happened, later on, when I was in the center.&#160; God  works in strange &amp; mysterious ways, that's for sure :)&#160; I wish her well  &amp; much&#160;peace.&#160;

I wrote her  an email about her comment.&#160; Then all of a sudden Karen said to me that her  husband&#160;works at&#160;Channel 10 News.&#160; I was shocked, in a good way.&#160;&#160;One never knows, does one.&#160;

Valerie had left I decided  to go to the Front Lines by myself.&#160; I got the literature box &amp; the graphic  picture of the precious aborted baby&#160;&amp; off I went to confront evil, through  the grace of God.&#160; It was still light outside, so I wasn't afraid, for I know  that the dear Lord is watching over me.&#160;I saw a couple that was walking down the  sidewalk, on the other side, of the street.&#160; They just looked at the picture of  the aborted baby so I called over to them that Planned Parenthood&#160;does this to  children.&#160; I invited the couple to come across the street for&#160;a Truth packet.&#160;  The young man walked over to me &amp; he asked me where did they kill the babies  &amp; I pointed over to Planned Parenthood.&#160;&#160;He then said something to me that  was most disturbing, he said "my ex girlfriend killed my baby, a couple of weeks  ago, &amp; I was looking for where she did it, I was looking for this place".&#160; I  felt like the Holy Spirit was speaking though me &amp; I said to him "don't kill  her, otherwise you'd be as bad as she, for what she did, &amp; you'd have to  spend the rest of your life in jail".&#160; He said&#160;"I had a dream that I did it".&#160;  I&#160;said "it was just a dream don't make it a reality &amp; ruin your life,  your&#160;child wouldn't want that".&#160; I looked in my literature box for  some&#160;brochures to give to him to comfort him &amp; some phone numbers to call  for help.&#160; I found some to&#160;give him along with a Truth packet &amp; he was  grateful.&#160; I told him that I felt his pain &amp; I was sorry for his loss.&#160;He  just smiled at me &amp; then&#160;he ran back across the street to his female  friend.&#160; My heart sank, for what this man&#160;was feeling&#160;&amp; what he was&#160;going  through,&#160;to lose his child to abortion.&#160; Lord have Mercy!&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I was standing there on the sidewalk &amp; I saw  that Jim Bovay, the neighbor from across the street, had put out two green  plastic tables on the sidewalk for trash pick up.&#160; So I went over across the  street &amp; I picked them up for the center or to be used at our street  ministry.&#160; Thanks Jim &amp; it's so nice&#160;of you&#160;&amp; the other Jim, who lives  next to you,&#160;not hassling us anymore.&#160; I hope that it stays that way even in the  summertime!!&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I saw that the abortionist at Planned  Parenthood, Rachael Phelps was leaving, it was around 4:30pm.&#160; When she was&#160;at  the mouth of the entrance/exit&#160;I said to her "if you want the Truth I have it  &amp; we're praying for your conversion every day that you'll stop killing  children".&#160; She looked to the left &amp; then the right, to make sure that there  was no traffic coming,&#160;so as not to kill anyone, (which is a good thing). &#160;I  just wish that&#160;she would realize this&#160;at Planned Parenthood too.&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I was calling out to a young man who had left  earlier &amp; was now coming back.&#160; Then all of a sudden he was walking towards  me from around the bushes.&#160; I wanted to get my cell phone to show him that I  could easily call 911 if he become threatening but I didn't reach for it.&#160; I  must have felt that he was okay.&#160; He asked me some questions about abortion like  "what would you do if you were raped by your father who had AIDS, would you have  an abortion"? &#160;I said "no, for it wasn't the fault of the baby that was  conceived to deserve a Death sentence for a crime that he or she didn't  commit".&#160; "What if the baby develops Aids after birth", he said.&#160; I said "then  you treat the baby with medication &amp; lots of love".&#160; "No one has the right  to kill, only in self defense, &amp; this isn't it", I said.&#160; Then he asked me  more question &amp; made more statement that were a little strange.&#160; Then he  said what I though that the would say "I'm an atheist".&#160; He said that he was  once a Christian but isn't anymore.&#160; I asked what happened &amp; he said  "science".&#160; "Oh", I said that's what got you confused.&#160; I&#160;suggested to&#160;him if he  didn't believe in God then just you ask him to show himself to you.&#160; The I  pointed to a the tree next to us &amp; said "this is a tree no matter what you  say it's a tree &amp; they are bushes &amp; I pointed to them &amp; there is the  sky &amp; it's the sky &amp; not what you want it to be or think that it is, it  will always be the sky".&#160; "There are absolute Truths &amp; God is an absolute  Truth, no matter if you think so or not", I said.&#160; Then I asked him if he had  ever commanded a day to dawn &amp; he said "no" &amp; I said "God commends a day  to dawn every day&#160;&amp; it does."&#160;&#160;&#160;I told him that he will come back to the  faith &amp; he said no &amp; I said oh yes you will someday come back full  circle.&#160; All this time I was praying to the Holy Spirit for wisdom in speaking  to him.&#160; Then Cleveland came walking down the street &amp; I asked him to come  back in an hour &amp; I'll give him some food.&#160; I said we try to take care of  our part of the world, it being the littlest ones &amp; the poor &amp; needy.&#160;  He asked me how why God allows bad things to happen &amp; I said that we all  were created with a 'free will' to do good or evil,&amp; God will turn evil into  good".&#160; I then asked him why he was at Planned Parenthood.&#160; He was nice enough  to tell me that his girlfriend was here to prevent abortions by birth control.&#160;  I said "that's not true for she's causing abortions by using birth control".&#160;  "How can that be", he asked.&#160; I then went on to tell him how&#160;birth control works  as an abortificant, which causes the tiny baby to be dispelled,&#160;out of the  mother, into her menses (her period).&#160; That is an abortion, the loss&#160;of life.  &#160;Then he asked about the condoms. &#160;I said "they break don't they".&#160; I went on to  tell him that when he's having sex he is committing sin against his own flesh,  the Bible says, &amp; that you are now one in spirit with that person for all  eternity".&#160; "Do you want that"?&#160; He said "yes, I want to be united in spirit  with lots of women".&#160;I said to him&#160;"in time&#160;you'll wish&#160;that you weren't".&#160; I  quickly stated that married people are to be one, in flesh &amp; spirit,&#160;with  their spouse &amp; not single people.&#160; Then I looked to see that one of our  clients was&#160;standing in front of me .&#160; He said that no one was in the center  &amp; that he needed diapers for his 2 children.&#160; I said "okay".&#160; I saw that the  young man was becoming a little more jittery &amp; as he was starting to walk  back to the parking lot.&#160;&#160;I called over to him saying "what's your name".&#160;  He&#160;hollered back &amp; said &#160;"Ben".&#160; I hollered over to him saying "my name is  Mary &amp; I'll see you in Heaven someday Ben".&#160; My heart ached for his  conversion.</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Our client helped me to carry the two tables &amp;

didn't take him with him to the sidewalk.&#160; I  should have said something to him about that.&#160; The child was only about 4 years  old &amp; something could&#160;have happened to him, being alone in the hallway.&#160;He  could have opened up the door &amp; ran away. &#160;Lord&#160;have Mercy!!&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">After I got our client the diapers that he needed I  went back out to the front lines once again until it was dark.&#160; As the workers,  of this place of sin &amp; death,&#160;drove out of the parking lot,&#160;I asked them to  "come to the light of Christ, for He created you &amp; died for your sins &amp;  loves you".&#160; I said to the one woman, who always waves to me "we can only  hope".&#160; I also called out to the people that God said "thou shall not kill"  &amp; that the Commandments are written in our hearts".&#160;

did lots more  work until I left at around 8:30pm to go home &amp; have supper.&#160; I spotted the landlord &amp; his wife, when I left the center tonight, &amp; he said that Ester, the owner of the&#160;Ethiopian restaurant next door, was closed due to a death in the family.&#160; How sad.&#160; </span></strong></span></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wednesday, February 8, 2012 at Focus</strong></span></span></span></p><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>They say that pro lifers never have an fun, well  that just isn't true!!&#160; We are happy people because we have the Lord &amp; we  have the truth.&#160; What could be better.&#160; I arrived at the center after Mass &amp;  I was going to open up the center &amp; do some other things while I wait for  Karen to arrive.&#160; Martha had to get her car back after they repaired it  &amp; Paul had another commitment today, so he wasn't planning to come to Focus  this afternoon.&#160; Well there he was in the parking lot after Mass.&#160; I said to  him,&#160;"I thought that you weren't able to make it today".&#160; He said that he had  another commitment but he had 15 minutes to help me out first.&#160; I was so happy  &amp; I thanked him for his thoughtfulness.&#160; Just then Tony &amp; Joyce pulled  into the parking lot with a donation for the center.&#160; Tony was walking with  crutches so I asked him what happened.&#160; He said that yesterday he had knee  surgery where they went into his knee to clean up the loose particles that were  moving around in there causing him great pain &amp; discomfort.&#160; He was still  effected by the drugs that he took yesterday &amp; the doctor wanted him to walk  around, to keep moving.&#160; I was grateful for their 4 donation bags that they  blessed Focus with.&#160; We talked for a few minutes &amp; they had to leave &amp;  after Paul helped me out for 15 minutes he had to go too,&#160; Just then a  grandmother of two small boys got out of the van &amp;&#160; was walking towards the  center when in comes Karen with boxes of diapers, size 4, our most popular size,  &amp; size 5 which is a runner up.&#160; She also brought in some donations &amp;  some paper towels &amp; toilet paper too.&#160; Thanks so much Karen, we really do  appreciate your thoughtfulness &amp; generosity to the center.&#160; She was nice  enough to spend about 40 minutes in the Material Aid Room, with the door closed  so that the two young boys wouldn't escape, so that the grandmother could shop  for them.&#160; Her daughter is having baby # 3, another boy, real soon.&#160; So she is  one busy grandmother that's for sure.&#160; She said that she's moved to South Ave.  &amp; is not in walking distance to the center as she was before.&#160; As long as  she has a van she can come when needed.&#160; She&#160;filled 3&#160;bags of things for her  family &amp; got some diapers &amp; off she went.&#160; I then spent some time with  Karen talking with her, she's a very interesting person, that's for sure &amp; a  blessing to Focus too.&#160; Martha then came in from picking up her car &amp; then  she went out to the front lines, by herself, with some signs &amp; the box of  literature, for educational purposes.&#160; She was out there for about an hour &amp;  a half while we stayed in the center to do the work.&#160; Karen again assisted  another client that just came in for much needed items for her children.&#160; She  then packaged the diapers, in individual baggies, with about 10 in each package  &amp; then she marked them &amp; then put them in a box, in the hallway of the  Great Room.&#160;It was now time for her to leave but before&#160;she left&#160;she gave&#160;me  some great ideas, for our clients that have been sexually abused,&#160;to get the  help that they need.&#160; She's going to try to find a 800 number, in New York  State, that is NOT affiliated with Planned Parenthood"s Rape Counseling  Services.&#160; These poor girls need people that respect life....not those who take  lives, to talk to.&#160; We, at Focus, want to start to deal with the sexual abuse  victims too, so that they can get help &amp; healing, from what had happened to  them.&#160; We will work on this project continually.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Just before Karen had to go the 3 Elim Bible  Institute students arrived.&#160; I said "hi" to them &amp; then they introduced  themselves to Karen before she left.&#160; I was happy that they all got to meet each  other.&#160; I always ask them to go wash their hands or to use the santatizer,  because I don't want anyone to get sick if I can avoid it.&#160; After that I gave  them each their own assignments to do.&#160; I asked Amy to make up the Truth packets  &amp; for Bea to package the rest of the diapers in baggies &amp; for Danielle  to call on the pac'n play, that we received last week, from one of our regular  clients that received it from her&#160;cousin's basement.&#160; Danielle had opened up the  pac'n play to try to find the phone number to call to see if there was a recall  on it &amp; to make sure that the instructions were in the package but when she  opened it she hollered out "there's a rat in it".&#160; I hurried over to see &amp;  what I saw was a dead mouse that was surrounded by unpopped pop corn kernels.&#160;  At least he died a happy death.&#160; He probably ate to much or he was crushed,  either one.&#160; I said "lets get it out of hear right away &amp; we'll put it out  in the dumpster.&#160; I opened up the back door &amp; out it went into the dumpster,  cur plop.&#160; We got a good laugh out of this one &amp; we will always check out  the items that we receive from anyone, which we try to do before we give it away  to one of our clients.&#160; Thank God that no client received this horror.&#160; <br /></strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Tucker came &amp;

I &amp; for Focus.&#160; I prayed for them too.&#160; Before  that I had shared part of my testimony with them.&#160; I had a few minutes to  freshen up before the recruiting meeting at 4:30.&#160; I had called Pat to see if  she was coming &amp; she said that one of her great children had left &amp; has  not returned home &amp; this is the 4th. day&#160;missing&#160;&amp; she was going to go  out to look for her again.&#160; She is the grandmother &amp; the great grandmother  that I met&#160;3 years ago in March in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Her great  grandson was the RU486 save.&#160; I asked if she had called the police &amp; she  said that she could go to places that the police couldn't to try to find her.&#160;  She must have an idea where she went, I hope.&#160; Now the doorbell rang &amp; it  was Rick.&#160; Martha, Rick &amp; I sat down &amp; stated talking about ways that we  could get more people out in front of Planned Parenthood to pray &amp; protest.&#160;  It was about 20 minutes later that Pastor Everett came into the meeting.&#160; He  apologized for being late &amp; he went on the discuss his ideas with us.&#160; It  was a very fruitful meeting to say the least.&#160;

How sad.&#160; He said  that he wasn't going to be able to come back to help out this afternoon &amp;&#160;I  said that was fine &amp; thanked&#160;him, for all the help that he&#160;does&#160;for us, at  the center.&#160;I got to&#160;talk to Sheila before she had&#160;to go&#160;&amp; she told me what  had happened on her time.&#160; She said that a car had stopped to talk to her &amp;  the passenger told her that she just had an abortion &amp; that she regretted it  right away &amp; was crying.&#160;&#160;The girl&#160;said that she was going to go to Mass  this Sunday, for she's been away form the Church, for a long time.&#160; Sheila  suggested for her to go to the Sacrament of Confession before going to Holy  Communion.&#160; If&#160;a woman&#160;has had an abortion,&#160;she is atomically Excommunicated,  until&#160;she goes to Confession to confess, with a sincere heart, this Mortal sin.&#160;  Sheila gave her a Truth packet.&#160; Then the driver, which was her cousin,&#160;told her  that she thinks that she might be pregnant &amp; if she is, she might have an  abortion, too.&#160; She said to the driver "why don't you go to Focus right next to  this yellow building for a pregnancy test.&#160; She said that she might but made  some mention of going to the drug store for a pregnancy test.&#160; She told her that  abortion wasn't the answer just look at your cousin&#160;&amp; the shape that's she's  in.&#160;&#160;Sheila mentioned that we can help her at the Focus Center.&#160;Sheila asked the  passenger for her phone number &amp; she gave it to her. Then they drove away.&#160;  Sheila is planning on calling the girl, that had the abortion soon, to see how  she &amp;&#160;her cousin were doing.&#160; Our hearts sank at this  situation.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>Sheila had gone when Karen came into the  center.&#160; I knew that Martha was out on the front lines so I spoke with Karen for  a few minutes before going outside to join the team.&#160; She was nice enough to  have brought in more donations to Focus which I'm very appreciative of.&#160; I left  her doing work in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I wasn't outside for very long when a  car was driving into the Planned Parenthood parking lot.&#160; I called over to the  woman &amp; told her that they were racist &amp; she replied that she was  Baptist.&#160; It's sometimes difficult to get the point across sometimes.&#160; I spoke  with her a few seconds &amp; then told her about Focus &amp; what we offer  there.&#160; I pointed to where it was &amp; she backed out of the parking lot &amp;  followed me to the center one building down.&#160; I rang the doorbell to give Karen  a heads up, for Suzanne, our Thursday Client Advocate,&#160;wasn't there yet.&#160; I then  opened the front door with my key &amp; as we entered. Karen was now walking  towards us.&#160; I introduced the woman to Karen, for I had already introduced  myself to her when she got out of her car, in the parking lot, where the  center&#160;is located.&#160; I lead her to the Rose Counseling&#160;Room &amp; asked Karen to  speak to her &amp;&#160;to see what we can do for her &amp; for her to fill out the  Intake Sheet, for the woman said that she was pregnant.&#160; I went &amp; got a  Truth packet &amp; a Focus brochure &amp; gave it to her &amp; then I&#160;closed the  counseling door.&#160; I then went back outside to the front lines &amp; resumed my  position there.&#160; Dan, Addison &amp; Adolf had now arrived &amp; were with Bill,  on the other side of the street, to pray &amp; to witness the Truth about  abortion.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>I  had asked Martha to go to the brick side of Planned Parenthood to read the  prayer 'My Life Depends on You', which has saved a life about 2 years ago when  Martha had read it &amp; a young girl responded to it &amp; went home with her  baby still in her womb.&#160; That little one is probably about a year &amp; a half  now &amp; walking &amp; trying to talk.&#160; Thank God :)&#160; So I asked Martha to read  the poem, to try to soften the hearts of the men &amp; women, that just walked  into the Killing Mill, to have their precious babies decapitated &amp;  mutilated.&#160; Well she was there using the mega phone for about 45 minutes,  reading poems &amp; giving her 'life message'.&#160; It was about 2pm &amp; I saw  that Pastor Everett had now arrived to the front lines.&#160; I said to him that I  was afraid that he wasn't coming &amp; her told me not to fear for it will be  always coming.&#160; I was relieved to say the least.&#160; I then quickly went into the  center to se how Karen was doing for Suzanne had not arrived yet.&#160; I went into  the center &amp; poor Karen&#160; was stressed out for after she counseled the woman  I had brought to her another young lady had come in for a pregnancy test too  &amp; it became quite hectic but Karen had it in control, due to her past  experience as a Physician.&#160; Just then Suzanne had arrived so I filled her in to  some things that I wanted her to know before she started her routine.&#160; Valerie  had arrived &amp; was helping out in the center.&#160; I went back outside to the  hostile environment, the Killing Zone, at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Two young girls  were leaving &amp; as they left I just said to them "no sex" &amp; the driver  drove out not paying attention &amp; almost ran into a car.&#160; I always pray that  there will never be an accident at the mouth of the parking lot.&#160; I do try, now  more than ever, not to say to much to them&#160;as they're leaving, so&#160;as not to  upset them so that they become distracted &amp; have an accident, where they  could be hurt or killed, or some one else involved.&#160; I try to do most of my  talking as they are coming into Planned Parenthood &amp; when they get out of  the car &amp; start walking into the building &amp; when they come out heading  to their car &amp; as they are leaving but before they come out to the street.&#160;  But sometimes the message I give them is upsetting them already as they are  leaving then they react to what I have already said to them.&#160; They will give me  their middle finger, throw something at me or say very bad words to me.&#160; The  guilt &amp; shame, of what&#160;they have&#160;done,&#160;has already effected them.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>Then two other young girls came out of the  building &amp; were walking to their car when I said to the one girl.&#160; "I hope  that you weren't involved in the killing of a little baby"?&#160; Sparks flew.&#160; She  cursed at me &amp; I told her that wasn't acceptable &amp; was disrespectful.&#160;  She said "I don't care".&#160; Martha said back to her "you should care"!&#160; I  then&#160;added "we do care about you".&#160; Where are their parents??? &#160;As they were  leaving she made it quite clear for me to see that she had her middle finger up  &amp; her face was twisted in anger.&#160; As she&#160;drove by me, who was&#160;standing on  the sidewalk.

I only hope that they will repent before  they have to stand before Almighty God someday.&#160; </strong>&#160;<strong>There was a  man in a car waiting by where we are standing by the bushes.&#160; He got out of the  car &amp; came over to Pastor Everett &amp; I.&#160; He said that he was told that  she was in there for pre natal vitamins.&#160; I said "sir they don't give pre natal  care here &amp; Thursdays are the day that they kill little babies".&#160; He said  that he wasn't sure if he was for it or against it.&#160; I said "what do you mean"?&#160;  "Abortion is always evil &amp; is wrong".&#160; I then asked him to go into Planned  Parenthood to offer the mother help &amp; to save a life, of the baby &amp; of  the mother".&#160; He hesitated &amp; said that he couldn't.&#160; I was so frustrated  &amp; I handed him a Truth packet which he took.&#160; I then looked over to Pastor  Everett &amp; asked him to talk to him, man to man.&#160; He did.&#160; He found out that  he was in recovery for drug &amp; alcohol abuse &amp; he didn't have his  bearings straight.&#160; He went back into the car to wait.&#160; In the meantime a couple  of cars drove in &amp; we needed to talk to them before they went into the  Killing Mill.&#160; About 15 minutes later, an older mean looking woman, got into the  car with the man &amp; drove off.&#160; As he passed by me, he showed me that he  still had the Truth packet.&#160; I called out to him "God bless you".&#160; He was a sad  sight but of a good heart but controlled by the old bag who was driving the car,  that's for sure.&#160; I'm not sure on his story, for I never saw a young girl get  out of the car &amp; go into Planned Parenthood or come out &amp; get into the  car.&#160; Not to sure of this scenario.&#160; I hope that&#160;this was all in his mind &amp;  not a reality, today.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><strong>Martha was now with me &amp; she mentioned  to me quickly that she had the mega phone on #8 when she was at the brick side  of the building.&#160; I said "what"!&#160; Martha try to make sure, when you're using the  mega phone, that it's on #'s 2 or 3, not any higher, for they could take the  mega phone away from us or try too.&#160; She said "okay".&#160; She stayed with Pastor  Everett &amp; I for awhile &amp; then she went into the center to get warmed up,  for it was starting to get colder, outside.&#160; I didn't dress warmly enough&#160;for  we've had a warm winter so far so I didn't dress properly, which I regret.&#160; The  men across the street had to leave thus leaving Pastor Everett &amp; I alone on  the front lines.&#160; He spoke strongly giving so much vital information to those  who were going into this 'den of death'.&#160; A car was coming out of the parking  lot &amp; she had a smirk on her face &amp; then I looked to my right to see  that a police car had stopped along side of me.&#160; I looked over at him &amp; said  "hello officer, what can I do for you".&#160; He answered back.&#160; "is there just the  two of you is there anyone else out her"?&#160; I said back "there were more people  earlier but they had to go".&#160; "What is the problem officer"?&#160; He said back to  me, "someone form the next street over called 911 to complain of a loud noise".&#160;  I said to him that one of our sidewalk counselors was using the mega phone  earlier &amp; she told me that she had it up to #8 but usually we try to keep it  at 2 or 3.&#160; He replied back "that's okay, no problem".&#160; I then added "we're  trying to save lives her officer".&#160; He said "I understand".&#160; In the meantime two  more police cars came up University Ave. to join him.&#160; Then they formed a line  of the three police cars in the street, thus blocking off the one lane of  traffic.&#160; The cars had to go into the other lane to get by the 3 police cars.&#160;  I&#160; was glad that there wasn't any 'head on' accidents.&#160; They&#160; left about 10  minutes later.&#160; Nice police officer, he didn't even get out of his car or ask my  name &amp; address &amp; phone number.&#160; He seemed to understand what we were  trying to do out on the front lines.&#160; The person who called into 911 I hope  heard what Martha was saying out there.&#160; The only problem was that she did have  the mega phone faced towards the Planned Parenthood building &amp; not the  street, so I don't see how they would have heard the noise, or if they did, it  shouldn't&#160;have been to offensive to them.&#160; I guess I'm wrong.&#160; Lord have  Mercy!!&#160; When I later got into the center I told Martha what had happened &amp;  I told her that it was all her fault that the police came &amp; we both got a  good laugh.&#160;

only  enough for a car to get through.&#160; As the police officer was checking out this  man's license, Sheila walked up to the truck&#160;&amp; started talking to the man.&#160;  He told her that the truck was his boss's &amp; the registration was lapsed  &amp; that he had a suspended license too.&#160; She told him that God had a reason  for this &amp; to seek Him out if he didn't know the Lord.&#160; He said "yes I  will".&#160;

I stayed until 6pm this day but before I went into the  center I had tow uncomfortable incidents first.&#160; The first one was a man who was  coming out of the vets from across the street hollered an obscenity to me &amp;  I caught him by surprise because he didn't see that I had a mega phone &amp; I  used it on him.&#160; I said "repent of your murdering".&#160; I hope that he does.&#160; The  next incident was that a car had stopped from across the street asking for  directions.&#160; So I stuck my head out from the sidewalk to try to help her when  all of a sudden I heard a honk of a horn &amp; then I saw a streak of yellow  pass&#160; me by &amp; felt the breeze of the bus who was about I foot to where I was  standing.&#160; My legs turned to jelly &amp; my heart skipped a beat.&#160; After she  left I just stood there for a few minutes to get a grip.&#160; The next day I did  call to report the incident &amp; they told me that they needed a bus number to  do anything about this incident.&#160; I told them the time &amp; place &amp; asked  for her to give this information for investigation to her superior.&#160; She said  that she will.&#160; Next Thursday I plan to stay to 6pm to get the bus number &amp;  to call them again with that information.&#160; He needs to be called on the carpet  for this.&#160; If he did it on purpose or not I don't know but it was unsafe &amp;  stupid &amp; very dangerous.&#160;

The mother left the children high &amp; dry &amp;  she&#160;dropped them over to the grandmother's house,&#160;to take care of,&#160;&amp;&#160;she's  no where to be found now.&#160; The police are looking for her &amp; when they find  her they will take her to court for abandonment &amp; the grandmother will then  file for full custody of the two boys.&#160; The grandmother was very grateful for  food &amp; clothes,&#160;for the children, who she loves.&#160; She did say that the one  boy cries all the time for the mother....how sad.&#160; We tried to give her some  emotional support before she left the center.&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">We worked in the center for some time when I  suggested that we to go out to the Front Lines.&#160; We got the signs &amp; the mega  phone &amp; the literature box &amp; off we went&#160; outside.&#160; When we got to the  sidewalk&#160;I noticed that the Death Escort was just leaving....perfect timing.&#160; I  also noticed that the abortionist wasn't there &amp; the parking lot was almost  empty.&#160; Yeah!!&#160;&#160; We stayed there witnessing &amp; counseling.&#160; A car with two  women was leaving the parking lot &amp; had stopped to receive a Truth packet  &amp;&#160;a DVD.&#160; We talked with them for a few minutes before that left saying "God  bless you too".&#160; It was a pleasant encounter.&#160; Then a car had stopped along side  of where&#160;we were standing &amp; it was Officer Jim, he's retired now from the  police force but he'll always be Officer Jim to me.&#160; I greeted him &amp; he told  me that he had good news for me.&#160; I said is it about Ben?&#160; It was.&#160;His&#160;son who  is in his 20's&#160;is suffering from an auto immune disease that has him bed  ridden.&#160; But the good news is that his friend who is a girl &amp; is studying  nursing in Brockport is being paid $10 an hour for his care rather than $30 by  an agency &amp; she does care about him too.&#160; I said that love &amp; laughter  &amp; prayer are true medicines for the body &amp; for the soul.&#160;He smiled.&#160; I  said stop by again soon&#160;&amp; give me another progress report.&#160; He said that he  will &amp; then drove off.&#160; Before he did I wished him a happy St. Valentine's  Day :)&#160; </span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">We had to leave the sidewalk because we saw that we  were needed back in the center to assist our clients.&#160; A father &amp; his two  sons &amp; a mother with a young son is a baby carriage.&#160; He was so cute!&#160; After  that I went back into the office to do some paper work in there &amp; Martha was  heating up her famous chili.&#160; After that nice supper we continued to work in the  center &amp; she let around 8pm&#160;&amp; stayed later.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div></div></div></div><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#160;<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wednesday, February 15, 2012 at Focus</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br /></strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;I have good news &amp; maybe not so good news, but I'm hopeful.&#160; The  good news is that one of our clients, came into the Focus Center, on  Wednesday, for a pregnancy test. She told us that it was five years ago,  when Focus was only a one room center, &amp; that she was given a  pregnancy test &amp; it was positive &amp; we talked her out of having  an abortion.&#160; She brought in her 5 year old daughter to prove it.&#160; We  were so happy to hear this great news.&#160; Later on a woman came in that I  gave a&#160; pregnancy test to, about a year &amp; a half ago, &amp; it was  positive &amp; through the grace of God was talked out of having an  abortion.&#160; She brought with her yesterday, her precious daughter, who  just learned to walk.&#160; Her test was positive.&#160; She couldn't guarantee me  that she won't have an abortion but she said that she will look over  what we gave her to take home, the brochures, DVDS &amp; CD'S &amp; she  said that she will remember what Martha &amp; I had said to her.&#160; She  did tell us that her older son, said to her the other day, that he was  going to have a baby brother, even before she knew that she was  pregnant.&#160; This was the Holy Spirit at work.&#160; We also found out that she  is a fallen away Catholic, so please pray for her return back to the  Church.&#160; We prayed with her before she left &amp; I called her, that  evening, to talk to her some more. So I am hopeful &amp; I do ask for  your prayers for this mom.&#160; We also did a pregnancy test on a very young  client on Tuesday &amp; the test was positive.&#160; Martha called her on  Wednesday &amp; she hadn't told her mother yet.&#160; So please keep this  young mother in your prayers too that her mother won't make her have an  abortion.&#160; We follow through on all our pregnant clients, thanks to  Suzanne, our client advocate. &#160;&#160; <br /><br />
&#160;I would like to introduce our new volunteer at Focus.&#160; Her name is  Karen.&#160; She is volunteering two afternoons a week.&#160; She has done so much  research for us already, so that we can better assist our clients &amp;  has been busy assisting the clients that come in for our services.&#160; She  will be leading an educational workshop at Focus this summer, using her  medical background, as a Physician.&#160; She's a blessing, as all our  volunteers, at Focus are.&#160; Welcome Karen!&#160; We also have a new sidewalk  counselor, out on the front lines.&#160; His name is Pastor Everett &amp;  he's a prayer warrior, in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; He speaks truth  with conviction &amp; he offers help to those who are going into Planned  Parenthood.&#160; He's already been a 'life saver'.&#160; We are blessed to have  him on the front lines, along with all the other prayer warriors &amp;  sidewalk counselors, who are so dedicated by being out there praying  &amp; witnessing the Truth!&#160; Welcome Pastor Everett!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Thank you again for your faithfulness &amp; prayers, for our ministries, we couldn't do it without you!!&#160; We are a Team!!</span><br /></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong> <br /></strong></span></span></p><hr /><p>&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">Thursday, February 16, 2012 <span style="font-weight: bold;">on the Front Lines</span></span></span></strong></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><font color="#000000">When I arrived to the center there was our newest volunteer Karen getting  out of her van &amp; walking towards me.&#160; I asked if she could help me bring  into the center the donations that I just received.&#160; She said "sure" &amp; then  she begun to take the bags out of the car &amp; to bring them into the center.&#160;  As we walked in together there&#160;was Sheila just coming out of the Counseling Room  after having done a pregnancy test.&#160; After the young lady left I spoke briefly  to Sheila about the time that she was there out on the front lines.&#160; Just then  Martha walked into the center &amp; was preparing to go to the front lines to  counsel.&#160; Then Sheila told me that a car had stopped while driving out of the  parking lot &amp; the passenger told Sheila that she just had an abortion &amp;  was feeling badly about it.&#160; Sheila then talked with her for a few minutes &amp;  then gave her a Truth packet &amp; took down her name &amp; phone number so that  she could call her to give her more help in the future.&#160; Sheila told her that  what she'd done was a serious sin &amp;that she needed to confess it to God for  forgiveness.&#160; She took the packet &amp; said "thank you" then they drove away.&#160;  I said to Sheila that this&#160;was the second week that this had happened to her,  which is a miracle that anyone would stop after having an abortion.&#160; It's just  to bad that they went &amp; had an abortion in the first place.&#160; Our hearts  aches for that.&#160; She then said "good bye" &amp; off she went.&#160; I then spoke with  Karen for a few minutes before I left the center to go out to the front lines to  do battle.&#160; Ephesians 6:12 reads: For our  struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the  powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces  of wickedness in the heavenly places.&#160; When I got to the sidewalk there was  Martha, Adolf, Dan, Bill &amp; Addision already there praying &amp; witnessing.&#160;  I picked up the mega phone &amp; started to speak through it to talk to the  people coming into Planned Parenthood mostly to have their baby be killed.&#160; It  was about 1:45pm when Pastor Everett had arrived.&#160; I was so happy to see him for  he gives a good message out there on the front lines  too.&#160;</font></span></span></span></strong>&#160;<strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></p><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><font color="#000000">Martha a went into the center to get&#160;warmed up,&#160;so  it was Pastor Everett &amp; I on the sidewalk by the bushes.&#160; A car drove into  the parking lot&#160;&amp; a young woman got out of her car.&#160; I called over to her to  tell her what was going on in Planned Parenthood &amp; to offer her help. Then  all of a sudden she was walking over to us coming around the bushes.&#160; She  looked&#160;right at me &amp; said "what did you say to me as I was getting out of my  car"?&#160; I looked right at her &amp;&#160;said "I was telling you that they're killing  babies in there right now"!&#160; </font>&#160;<font color="#000000">"I'm&#160;gong in for birth control", she said.&#160; I said back to  her "well then you're killing babies too, for birth control acts as an  abortificiant".&#160; She didn't like to hear that &amp; then she became arrogant  towards me.&#160; She had now put up a brick wall between us.&#160; She was a 'know it  all' &amp; it was difficult to reach her.&#160; She was a teacher looking for work  she told Pastor Everett for she didn't want to talk to me anymore.&#160; I did offer  her a Truth packet but she refused &amp; I told her that it figured.&#160; She was so  smart that she was stupid.&#160; Sorry but it's true.&#160; Sometimes the so called  educated ones that we get to talk to are so hard to penetrate with the Truth but  the young girls that are struggling with their education are more able to grasp  what we're saying to them, for they didn't get their minds messed up in  college.&#160; I could be wrong but I don't think so.&#160; Every time I tried to say  something to her she would say "you're interrupting me" or "I'm not speaking to  you" or "speak when you're spoken to".&#160; You get the drift.&#160; I finally squeezed  in to say "I care about you even though you've been rude to me".&#160; She looked at  me puzzled.&#160; They I said that birth control, like the pills, shot, those with  hormones, can cause breast cancer.&#160; She started to cry &amp; said "don't talk to  me about breast cancer because my mother died of breast cancer".&#160; I said "then  you're doubling your risk of developing it, if you're on birth control".&#160; I then  looked at her hands &amp; I noticed that she didn't have a wedding ring on it.&#160;  So I stuck my neck out again &amp; said "you're not even married so you  shouldn't being having sex either".&#160; If looks could kill. At that point I just  let Pastor Everett minister to her &amp; he did a nice job of it.&#160; She then went  into Planned Parenthood, for 31/2 hours, I started to get worried if she was  dead or alive in there,&#160;so I figured that she was getting the Depo shot, very  bad or the IUD, also an abortificant, very bad, because&#160;she was in there for  such a long time.&#160;

I asked her if she would go  to the brick side of the building to read the poems to the girls that were  already in the Waiting Room.&#160; She took the mega phone &amp; the poems &amp; went  over to do her counseling there.&#160; I asked her to please make sure that the mega  phone was put on either 2 or 3&#160;because we didn't want the police to come again  this week.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; off she went.&#160; She was reading the poems &amp;  then all of a sudden I heard a voice that was screaming&#160;obscenities to Martha,  so I butted in.&#160; I said to the young girl not to speak to Martha that way &amp;  she got more belligerent.&#160; She then started to swear at Martha &amp; got the  three kids that were in the van with her to do the same.&#160; They all had stuck  their heads out of the van window &amp; were screaming at, our Martha.&#160; What is  going on here??&#160; I decided to take the sign &amp; go over to the sidewalk across  the street, for Bill had left &amp; so did Dan,&amp; Addison, Adolf was in the  center warming up.&#160; I forgot that I also had the mega phone with me when I went  over across the street, in front of the condos.&#160;&#160;The woman was now going  ballistic!!&#160; I then called over to Martha, with the mega phone, not&#160;that if&#160;we  both keep quiet then she can't retaliate back to us.&#160; Martha agreed.&#160; At this  point Martha was saying the 'Hail Mary' prayer &amp; wasn't engaging her at all  but was praying for her.&#160; Then all of a sudden a police car was right in my  face.&#160; It was Officer Mike.&#160; I looked at him &amp; said "hi Officer Mike, what's  wrong".&#160; He said "Mary could you do me a favor &amp; turn the mega phone down",&#160;  I said "sure".&#160; The all of a sudden the mean old man from the condo was right in  my face with his finger saying that I woke him up.&#160; Then Officer Mike got out of  his car &amp; walked over to us on the sidewalk.&#160; Then Martha &amp; Pastor  Everett came over to where I was standing.&#160; I looked over to the young girl with  the three kids &amp; she was smirking at me.&#160; This fiasco made her feel good.&#160; I  wasn't sure if the police were called before I got to the other side of the  sidewalk or they were picking on Martha, who was at the brick side of the  building, for about 20 minutes now.&#160; The officer didn't know either he just said  that there was a call that had come in &amp; he responded.&#160; It really doesn't  matter for her was now here.&#160; Well the neighbor Jim just went on &amp; on &amp;  on.&#160;I suggested ear plugs ( I use them) but this was taken as being sarcastic.&#160;  Me, never!!&#160;&#160; Finally the officer said that he was going to arrest us all.&#160; I  felt that he was being irrational but it scared the neighbor to go back into his  condo, he wasn't taking any chances that's for sure.&#160; After he left I said to  Officer Mike "Officer Mike do you think I could talk to you without being  threatened".&#160; He said "I didn't threaten you".&#160; I said "yea you did".&#160; Then I  went on to try to resolve this problem.&#160; I said that this neighbor has 911 on  speed dial &amp; that he's always looking out the window taking our pictures  &amp; he just told all of us that he had Martha &amp; my pictures on video but  he didn't have Pastor Everett's picture yet.&#160; What's that all about , it's  creepy.&#160; I then asked him questions about the noise ordinance &amp; he wrote  down the information for me to retrieve it on the Internet at www. Cityof  Rochester.gov..&#160; Thanks Officer Mike I knew that you were nice but under  pressure you're not.&#160; Bye &amp; thank you.&#160; The next day I called our police  advocate Officer Chris &amp; he said that he would talk with Officer Mike &amp;  to get a Doppler to measure the sound waves to put this baby to bed once &amp;  for all.&#160; The neighbor even said that I called the UPS driver a murderer.&#160; I  said that I didn't but if I did I have 'Freedom of Speech",&#160;go back to bed.&#160; I  truly feel sorry for him because he was in the&#160;Vietnam War.&#160; Earlier I  spoke&#160;with a gentleman who was walking down the street with booze on his  breath&#160;&amp; spoke with him for a few minutes.&#160; I tried to get him to come back  to the Catholic Church for he said that he had left the Church years ago &amp;  was going to&#160;a Protestant Church now.&#160; He was&#160; nice fellow.&#160; He took&#160;the Truth  packet wit a Rosary in it &amp; off he goes over to where Martha was standing.&#160;  He then asked to speak in the mega phone to the&#160;young&#160;woman who was screaming at  Martha.&#160; He talked into the mega phone for about 4&#160;seconds when she called him a  drunken sicko.&#160;&#160;Nice girl!!&#160; He then gave the mega phone back to&#160;Martha &amp;  walked away.&#160; So we know how the war can affect people that were involved in it  but we can't have this man harass us&#160;either every time we come out to protest  this Killing Mill, Planned Parenthood.&#160; That's what I&#160; said to the officer, that we were here  trying to&#160;save lives.&#160; But he said that he has right&#160;to a peaceful  home&#160;environment.&#160; I said "then why did he buy a condo right across from an  abortion mill".&#160; Go figure??&#160; &#160; </font></span></span> </strong></div></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></div><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></p><div><strong>&#160;

When I arrived Martha &amp; Paul were there &amp;  Martha was doing a pregnancy test &amp; Paul was putting away the donation  bags.&#160; I quickly ate lunch &amp; then went into the office to do some work in  there.&#160; We had the doorbell ring many time &amp; we offered assistance to many  mothers &amp; fathers that came in for children clothes &amp; small items &amp;  of course diapers &amp; wipes.&#160; We were so busy &amp; we were unable to go to  the front lines but when I pulled into our parking lot I saw two people out on  the sidewalk praying &amp; went over to thank them before going into the  center.&#160; Rick, the '40 Days for Life' coordinator started an unofficial, '40  days of Prayer', in front of Planned Parenthood during the Lenten season staring  on Ash Wednesday &amp; ending on the Sunday before Easter.&#160; So I was so happy to  see that the sidewalk have prayer coverage today while we were in the center  working.&#160; I wish that I could be in two places at once but I can't .....only God  can do that.&#160; My heart in on the front lines because there is where the people  are that need the Truth &amp; the information that we are able to provide for  them to help change their lives &amp; save their souls.&#160; My heart is also in the  pregnancy too, helping our moms &amp; their families live a better &amp; less  stressful life too.&#160; It's a great combination.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>We were blessed with people dropping off their  donations of food &amp;

for the portable Ultrasound  Machine, so that it can come to Focus, at least one day&#160;a week, for our girls to  see their precious babies.&#160; That just means that the remaining three business,  that are in the same building that we rent at, one of them will have to go some  place else, so that we can rent their room.&#160; I'm curious to see how the Lord is  going to answer my prayer for more room, for no one is talking about leaving at  this time.&#160; We're like family too but I need more&#160;space so that Focus can grow.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><font>Wednesday, February 22, 2012 at Focus</font></span></strong></span></span></p><div><div><span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>'Ash Wednesday' the first day of Lent.</strong></span></span></span></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I returned to the center after Mass today, which  was longer than usual, because of everyone receiving ashes, for Ash Wednesday,  the first day of&#160; 40 days of Lent.&#160; There&#160;are more people at this Mass, &amp;  really it was standing room only, plus we had the Eastman School of Music  playing the music which was beautiful.&#160; I didn't see Martha at Mass so I figured  that she went to another Mass.&#160; I was sitting way in the back of the Church, so  I left after the Mass was over to go to the center.&#160; There was two moms already  waiting for me &amp; then two more moms were right behind the other moms.&#160; I  went into the center &amp; opened up the rooms.&#160; In the meantime I asked the  moms, to sign in the book, in the Material Aid Room.&#160; I then went to get them&#160;  diapers, for their children.&#160; Just then Martha came into the center &amp; took  over so that I could go to the meeting about the Ultrasound Project.&#160; I arrived  at the meeting at Embracing Options at around 1:40pm &amp; was greeted by Dee,  who is the acting director of Embracing Options &amp; Jann, the Life Issues  Coordinator&#160;for the Diocese of Rochester, Dean, who is from the Knights of  Columbus, Kirsten, the director of a Place of Hope Resource Center &amp; Kathy,  the ultrasound stenographer.&#160;

there were our  three Elim Students working hard.&#160; They are such a blessing to us at the  center.&#160; </span></span></strong></div></div><p>&#160;<strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&#160;</span></span></span></strong></p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><font>Thursday, February 23, 2012, at the meeting downtown, &amp; on the Front  Lines</font></span></strong></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span></strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I was at a special meeting with all the heads of  the pro life community starting from 9am to 1:30pm.&#160; I had Rob, who is&#160;a teacher  &amp; was on school break &amp; is the sidewalk counselor on Mondays, take over for me along with Martha &amp; the rest of  the prayer team, so I knew that the sidewalk had good coverage, so that I could  go to this important meeting.&#160; Pastor Everett was on vacation.&#160; When I was at  the meeting I did receive a call from Sheila stating that she was having car  trouble &amp; had t take it into the shop so she wasn't planning to be there  during her time of 10:30am to 1pm.&#160; I was disappointed to hear this but I was  glad to know that she was okay.&#160; She felt badly too about this situation.&#160; I  talked&#160;with her later on this evening.&#160; The meeting downtown was simply  marvelous to say the least.&#160;I got to meet some new people that I didn't now  existed before.&#160; One was a woman named Florence &amp; she is the director of a  'new' pregnancy center in Greece, which is 10 minutes from the Planned  Parenthood there, which I just found out that now does abortions.&#160; How  horrible.&#160; There is a team of prayer warriors who have been there praying over  the past 10 years.&#160; This was a 'Cell' of Planned Parenthood's, which is located  across the street from Wegman's in a plaza, &amp; they did referrals, to the  head of the Octopus, which is the abortion mill on University Ave.in  Rochester.&#160;Now they are killing little babies there in Greece too.&#160; I was told  by another sidewalk counselor that he stopped by there one Saturday &amp; saw  that there were two ambulances in the Planned Parenthood driveway taking out a  young girl.&#160; Her baby was killed &amp; now she might die too.&#160; Abortion is not  safe for mother or child.&#160; At this meeting I meet a couple more women that I  hadn't&#160;known before.&#160; We decided to get together for coffee in the near future.&#160;  Great!!&#160; It was a forum of ideas &amp; information &amp; future actives that  will enhance our community.&#160; It was a blessing to be there,&#160;to say the least.&#160; I  got to share a very small portion of 'My Story', which I'm sure surprised many  of the people that I had already knew that didn't know about those two  incidents.&#160; "What you don't know can hurt you".&#160; Like the Bible says "You shall  know the Truth &amp; the Truth shall set you free".&#160; Lies &amp; deception can  only make you miserable.&#160; I agreed to two projects, which I will work on, in my  so called spare time.&#160; Ha Ha!&#160; Anything to promote the 'life issues' &amp; to  investigate &amp; to educate.&#160; After a great lunch we shared some more &amp; it  was now 1:30pm &amp; it was wrapping up.&#160; After all the 'good- byes' I went to  the center t change my clothes &amp; to get out to the front lines.&#160; I forgot  to&#160;mention that I had only about 6 restless hours of interrupted sleep so I  wasn't feeling too good.&#160; Worse then I usually do, which isn't good at all.&#160;  When I arrived at the center Paul was there putting away clothes.&#160; The doorbell  rang &amp; it was a young girl with her boyfriend asking for a pregnancy test.&#160;  I thought I was in a bad dream for Suzanne wasn't there yet&#160;&amp; it was now  2pm.&#160; I started the pregnancy test &amp; then in comes Suzanne to take over so  that I could get out on the front lines to join the team there.&#160; It all worked  out okay. There was Martha,&#160;standing by the bushes&#160;&amp; Rob was on the brick  side of the building &amp; the three prayer warriors were across the street.&#160; We  had the death building covered on all sides.&#160; One car after another came in  &amp; went out.&#160; Mass production of deathers.&#160; How horrible a sight.&#160; I hardly  get over it.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tuesday, February 28, 2012 at Focus</span></span></strong></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The  day started out with a phone call.&#160; A day  starting out with a phone is  not unusual at all but this phone call was, for  sure.&#160; It was an  acquaintance of mine named Chris, he's been out on the front  lines  praying in front of Planned Parenthood, during the '40 Days for Life'   during the Fall campaign.&#160; He was giving me a heads up telling me that a  young  woman had just called the doctors office that he works for as a  temporary  receptionist, taking over for the permanent receptionist that  was on maternity  leave, asking to where she could go for an abortion.&#160;  The husband &amp; wife  team of doctors in this particular aren't even  OB/GYN doctors.&#160; Well, Chris was  quite surprised to say the least&#160;  responded back to her that it wasn't a good  idea to have an abortion  &amp; call this number &amp; they can help you.&#160; He  then preceded to  give her the Focus Pregnancy Center's number &amp; my name.&#160; I  said  thanks Chris you did the right thing.&#160; He then said that he had asked  her  for her name &amp; phone number to which she gave it to him&#160;&amp;  then he gave  it to me.&#160; This was a smart move on his part, which was  the saving grace.&#160; After  I hung up I called Sheila, our client advocate  at Focus &amp; a sidewalk  counselor ,on the front lines,&#160;to see if she  would call this woman to start to  get the ball rolling,&#160;in  receiving&#160;help with her situation.&#160; She said that she  would.&#160; I hung up  the phone &amp; started to get ready to attend the noon Mass   downtown.&#160; A few minutes went by &amp; Sheila called me back.&#160; She said  that a  man had answered asking who she was &amp; so on.&#160; Sheila handled  the situation  very well, which I knew that she would, for she has a  gentle voice &amp; has  phone experience.&#160;After that phone call it was a  harrowing day filled with&#160;so  much pain, stress &amp; anxiety that I  almost couldn't bear it, only the grace  of God, got me through it &amp;  today was only the first day, of this most  unusual case.&#160; For this  story goes on &amp; on..........Come Holy Spirit come  fill me with  wisdom, knowledge&#160;&amp; discernment &amp; holy boldness when to  speak  or not to speak &amp; to know the difference, To speak&#160;with your words,   power &amp; grace &amp; to do the right thing, with love&#160; Amen.&#160; I  composed this  prayer, inspired by the Holy Spirit,&#160;to pray before I go  out to the front lines  to sidewalk counsel.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Martha  &amp; I arrived to the center after Mass  &amp; started to open up the  rooms to get ready for our clients that need our  assistance.&#160; I was so  worried about our new girl that she was abortion minded  &amp; that we  weren't able to connect with her as of yet.&#160; I need to trust in  the  Lord more.&#160; In the meantime Martha &amp; I were very bust helping our  girls  in the Material Aid Room.&#160; On of our&#160;regular clients came into  today with her  pregnant cousin &amp; her boyfriend, I wish that I could  say husband but that's  usually not the case anymore, which is so sad.&#160;  They all took so many things  &amp; every time that I brought something  into the Material Aid Room to put on  the shelves they took it.&#160; The  one girl came into the Green Room, for whatever  reason I don't know,  for we usually don't let anyone pass the glass door up the  hallway.&#160;  The minute that she saw the apples in the bowl she said "oh apples".&#160;  I  said just take one &amp; then her cousin came into the room while I was  busy  &amp; she took all the apples &amp; blamed it on her boyfriend,  to which I said  "first of all you weren't suppose to be in the room let  alone take ALL the  apples, that was very inconsiderate of you &amp;  him, please tell him that".&#160; He  was already waiting for the girls in  the car &amp; I didn't want to go outside.&#160;  After they left Martha  &amp; I&#160;discussed this situation, to better our clients  at  Focus.&#160;That's not what we want our clients to do, is to come into Focus,   thinking that everything is ' free &amp; you can help yourself'.&#160; They  need  boundaries, as we all do, in life.&#160; We're not helping the girls  if we are push  overs either. We don't want to set up rules &amp;  regulations, in the Material  Aid Room or in the center, for it would be  to hard to&#160;enforce them,&#160;because we  have so many&#160;girls coming into the  center weekly.&#160; I don't want a few people to  effect all our other  clients, when they come in&#160;to get what they need for their   families.&#160;&#160;We want them to respect for our facility.&#160; We love them &amp;  we want  to teach them values.&#160; Ironically the next day the one girl  came back into the  center &amp; when I saw her I said "you just were  here yesterday my dear &amp;  you took half of the room with you", with a  smile on my face.&#160; She looked at me  with sadness in her eyes &amp;  said "I think that my cousin, who was with me  yesterday,&#160;stole the  diapers that I got here".&#160; I know that Martha &amp; I can  be push  overs, at times, but I really did believe her.&#160; I said "okay you can get   more diapers today.&#160; She said "okay, I'll just come alone next month  &amp; thank  you Miss Mary".&#160; My heart was touched by her respect &amp;  gratitude.&#160; We gave  her more diapers &amp; then she left with her  little girl.&#160; We pray, all the  time, to do &amp; say the right things  to our girls, for their lives are  difficult enough &amp; we want to  reduce their stress level, so that they can  enjoy their children &amp;  not be rough with them, which stress can  do.&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I  received a call form Sheila saying that she has  missed a call from our  new client who was abortion minded.&#160; We talked for a few  minutes &amp;  after I hung up I realized that I forgot to turn my phone back on   after Mass today.&#160; I&#160;quickly checked my cell phone only to see that a  call from  her did come in before noon, when I had my phone turned off.&#160;  I checked&#160;her  message &amp; it was desperate.&#160; My heart sank again  &amp; I felt sick to my  stomach.&#160; I asked the Lord to turn this around  please.&#160; I then called&#160;the number  &amp; it just rang &amp; rang &amp;  rang.&#160; Oh no!!&#160; I called 911 to see if a  police officer would go over  to her&#160;house, but I didn't have an address. I  thought that by giving  them the phone number&#160; they could get the street address  from it&#160;but I  was wrong.&#160; The 911 operator said for me to keep&#160;on calling that  number  until I reached her.&#160; I said "thank you" &amp; hung up, with a sick   feeling in the pit, of my stomach.&#160; I couldn't finish my supper so I  pushed my  plate away.&#160; I then looked at Martha, who was sitting at the  table with me,  &amp; I asked her if she would call the number again.&#160;  Thank God that she said  "yes".&#160; I dialed the number &amp; I gave her  the phone.&#160; After a couple of  seconds passed by she was talking to some  one &amp; I thought that it was our  girl.&#160; So I asked Martha for the  phone &amp; she gave it to me.&#160; I heard a voice  on the other end saying  "why do people keep calling here, there's no one here by  that name ".&#160;  My heart sank again &amp; then all of a sudden I heard a female's   voice on the other line. I asked her if this was E..... &amp; she said  that it  was.&#160;Praise God!&#160; I told her that we want to see her &amp; if  it was possible  for her to get to Focus tomorrow, so&#160;we can&#160;talk.&#160; She  said that she will be at  Focus at 1:30pm tomorrow.&#160; She said that she  doesn't drive, so I asked her to  call the Taxi B Company &amp; gave her  their phone number &amp;&#160;we'll pay for  her ride.&#160; She said "thanks  &amp; I'll see you tomorrow".&#160; After I got off of  the phone I called  out to Martha, who was now in the Material Aid Room putting  things  away, &amp; walked over to her &amp; wept in her arms, for a few   seconds.&#160; I thanked the Lord for turning this around &amp; having us  reach her  after all the upsets &amp; downs earlier today with missing  her with the cell  phone &amp; also with Sheila missing her too while  she was baby-sitting her  grandchildren earlier.&#160; I felt like a 100  pounds of stress melted off of my  shoulders &amp; I could now breathe  easier.&#160;

I  called &amp; gave the heads up to both Karen, our new client advocate &amp;  Florence, who I just met last week &amp; was planning to come to Focus to have a  tour &amp; receive information, on how a pregnancy center runs, that our new  client Ms. E. was coming this afternoon.&#160; The plan was that Ms. E. was to call  for the taxi, which Focus was going to pay for, at 1:15pm &amp; then arrive at  the center to talk &amp; to repeat her pregnancy test, at 1:30pm.&#160; I was worried  that she wouldn't show up but thank God I was wrong for she came on time.&#160;  Martha decided to go out to the front lines by herself to pray &amp; counsel.&#160;  The day was cold &amp; windy but she weathered through it, she's a hardy one.&#160;  Florence arrived &amp; then we all went into the Rose Room to sit down at the  oval table to talk.&#160; She was a little scared &amp; we intimidated her, at first,  &amp; who could blame&#160;her&#160;but then she relaxed &amp; spoke her heart out about  her life &amp; her present situation.&#160; We repeated her pregnancy test &amp; it  was positively positive.&#160;She was disappointed by was gearing away&#160; from being  abortion minded, thank God.&#160; Karen, who is a physician, did a great job in  asking questions &amp; also Florence did a super job in adding her insights, to  the scheme of things.&#160; I added my two cents at times.&#160; I heard the doorbell ring  &amp; I&#160;excused myself &amp; got up to answer the door to see that Valerie had  come to help us out this afternoon.&#160; Paul couldn't make it today &amp; with all  these women &amp;&#160;three more coming at 2:30pm&#160;I was glad &amp; I'm sure he would  have felt a bit&#160;uncomfortable.&#160; After the hour long meeting she asked to stay  until 4pm for that's when her abusive boyfriend could pick her up.&#160; This was a  great idea, for her to stay with us for a couple of hours, to bond.&#160;She has  three children but her mother&#160;&amp; her 'new'&#160;husband was raising them until Ms.  E. gets clean.&#160; So I suggested for her to go into the Material Aid&#160;Room to pick  out some things for herself &amp; her children.&#160; She was happy to hear this  &amp; went into the room with her new friend Valerie.&#160; Karen had to leave so I  gave Florence a tour &amp; gave her lots of information to take back to her  pregnancy care center to use for her clients.&#160; I said that I would email her a  list&#160;of great &#160;web sites that can bless her center.&#160; She was very grateful.&#160;  Then the doorbell rang &amp; it was our three Elim Students coming in to help us  out for 2 hours.&#160; I introduced them to Ms. E &amp; to Florence &amp; then they  got to work.&#160; I went outside to flag Martha back into the center &amp; she said  that she would come back in after she had finished her Rosary.&#160; Anything you say  Martha.&#160; I then went back into the center to join the girls.&#160; It was so bust in  there &amp; everyone had something to do.&#160; After about 15 minutes I asked  everyone if they were hungry &amp; it was unanimous.&#160; So I suggested Wendy's  &amp; Focus was buying.&#160; It was our way of saying "thank you".&#160; Florence offered  to get our lunches so she took everyone's order &amp; I then gave her the  money.&#160; She took one of the Elim girls with her, which was a great idea &amp;  off they went.&#160; They returned about 20 minutes later &amp; we all gathered  together at the long table in the Green Room.&#160; Martha had now come in from the  cold &amp; joined us.&#160; We had a great time eating &amp; sharing our stories,  though some of them were painful, but necessary.&#160; It was a 'special' time for us  girls.&#160; After lunch Florence said "good bye".&#160; She tanked me for the tour &amp;  all the brochures &amp; other things that I gave her to use at her center in  Greece, NY..&#160; I was happy to do it.&#160; After she left the Elim girls worked in the  office &amp; putting away the bags of donations that we were just blessed with.&#160;  Hooray.&#160; It was now 4pm &amp; our new client said "good bye" too &amp; I again  had a few more minutes to talk with her.&#160; Earlier in the Rose Room she had  called Compass Care to scheduled an ultrasound to see how far along she was for  Thursday at 5pm.&#160; I said that I would take her there &amp; for her to meet me  here at 4:30pm &amp; if she needed transportation for her to just again call the  taxi company &amp; Focus will pay for the ride.&#160; She said that was nice of me  &amp; that not to many people have treated her so kindly in such a very long  time.&#160; I almost cried.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; out the door she went.&#160; As&#160;I  walked back to the Green Room I saw our street friend Cleveland come walking  towards the door.&#160; I then walked back to the door &amp; invited him into the  center to get something to eat.&#160; Well it turned into a shopping frenzy.&#160; He was  wet &amp; smelly &amp; he needed some new used clothes to change into, so I  decided to go to the second hand store on Clinton Ave. to buy him some pants,  shirts, sweater &amp; a jacket to keep him dry &amp; warm.&#160; I was gone about 45  minutes.&#160; When I came back to the center I noticed that there were two police at  Planned Parenthood standing on the sidewalk talking.&#160; I decided to walk over to  them &amp; ask them some questions.&#160; I introduced myself &amp; said that I was a  sidewalk counselor there in front of this building.&#160; The police officer said  "it's not what you think that it is, she had a mental breakdown".&#160; I then said  that I knew Officer Chris for he is our advocate &amp; the officer said that he  knew him &amp; that he goes to the same church that he does.&#160; I said "St.  Mark's" &amp; he said "yes".&#160; Then I said "that means that you know Fr. Bush"  &amp;&#160;he said that he did.&#160; Small world, isn't it.&#160; I then turned my attention  to the fence &amp; I saw that a disorientated woman was walking aimlessly sort  of in circles with a team of three Planned Parenthood workers following her in  unison.&#160; One was, Jeff Pier,&#160;the Director,  of the&#160;Rape Crisis Service at Planned Parenthood &amp; the other was an older  woman who has been with Planned Parenthood for as long as I can remember &amp;  I've been there since 1986.&#160; She probably hasn't been there that long but a long  time, that's for sure.&#160; The other person I didn't recognize so maybe she was  with the police department.&#160; Don't know.&#160; I called out the woman telling her  that God loved her &amp; that we would pray for her.&#160; She was finally assisted  into the ambulance which came about 15 minutes later.&#160; Poor soul!&#160; I then went  back into the center to give Cleveland his new , used clothes.&#160; He thanked me  &amp; off he went.&#160; He said that he was living with his brother wherever he  lives.&#160; The next day I saw that he had put on the brown corroded pants &amp; not  the shirts or sweater?&#160; I don't know what he's saving them for?&#160; He's such a  mystery &amp; he frustrated me something crazy but we love him &amp; will take  care of him as long as he walks this earth.&#160; God is great!!&#160;</span></strong></div></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></span></span><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></strong></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I talked with Martha regarding the woman that was  just brought by ambulance from Planned Parenthood &amp; I surmised that maybe  she saw the graphic picture that Martha had out on the front lines &amp; it was  a trigger for her &amp; she went&#160; ballistic.&#160; If you're post abortion or had any  traumatic event occur it usually takes a 'trigger' to have the experience blow  up in your face.&#160; Some people can deal with it with counseling &amp; support  &amp; other just have a break down.&#160; It seemed odd to me that she flipped out  today &amp; the director of Rape Counseling was with her.&#160; Imagine that the have  a Rape Counseling Center in the very same place that they murder little  babies???&#160; How sick are they, very sick.&#160; Last week there was a woman coming out  of Planned Parenthood screaming at me "I'm hear of rape counseling you idiot".&#160;  I said back to her "I'm a rape survivor &amp; what would you come here"?&#160; Let  her think about that one.&#160; My heart aches that in this city the only place that  you cane get so called rape counseling is at a place that they murder children,&#160;  You figure that out &amp; please give me your answer.&#160; At least with rape, &amp;  I am not minimizing the impact that rape has on a woman but at least she's alive  but with abortion, you're mutilated &amp; dead!!!!&#160;&#160; For I was conceived in rape  &amp; was almost killed by abortion but my twin brother didn't survive the  abortion in 1949.&#160; I am an incest survivor &amp; two attempted rapes, on by one  male &amp; the other by three males with a knife at my throat, at the Johnson  House Restaurant in Churchville, NY back in 1968&#160;&amp; a gang rape survivor of  three males at Strong Memorial Hospital in 1971.&#160; I&#160;was a virgin &amp;&#160;conceived  twins from that rape &amp; lost them 6 weeks later by a miscarriage&#160;&amp; my  mother did nothing about it.&#160; Flush it, just flush it, my mother said &amp; I  did.&#160;Later on&#160;I was molested by Dr.Tulssi Dass, a surgeon at Highland  Hospital,&#160;who took my appendix out in 1986.&#160; Morris Wortman, who is now the  abortionist in Brighton, NY, back&#160;in 1978 at Highland Hospital, just two months  after my total hysterectomy at 28 years of age,&#160;swung me around,&#160;in the hallway  of the hospital while I was on duty, as I walked&#160;passed him &amp;

We then went into the center &amp; I  hurried to open up the  doors to the different rooms, though I forgot the  bathroom door.&#160; Yes,  we even have a lock on that door too, it's a long story.&#160; I  told Karen  that I was now going out &amp; she was in charge.&#160; I was hoping that   Martha &amp; Pastor Everett were coming soon but I was wrong.&#160; When I  got  outside I went over to Paul &amp; he told me that Sheila was  waiting in her car,  in the parking lot, to talk to me, so I quickly  went over to where she was  waiting.&#160; I wanted to talk with Sheila &amp;  I did until Paul walked over to us  from the front lines to tell me  that he was going for lunch &amp; he will&#160;come  back, to work in the  center until 3pm&#160;&amp; then his sister Kathy will be  picking him up&#160; to  go&#160;get his car,&#160;from the garage.&#160; Poor Paul, for he's been  having lots  of car problems recently, with his car &amp; it's been costing him   lots of $$$.&#160; So after I said "good bye" to Sheila I walked over to the  Front  Lines, to start talking to the people going into Planned  Parenthood, for  whatever reason but concentrating on abortion, for it's  their surgical abortion  day.&#160; Bill was across the street with his sign  witnessing the Truth.&#160; Dan came a  few minutes later &amp; then  Adolph.&#160; Martha didn't come until 1:40pm &amp;  later on Pastor Everett,  called me on my cell phone, to tell me that he was sick  with a sore  throat &amp; he wouldn't be coming today.&#160; I said that I wished him   well &amp; then hung up.&#160; I noticed that my throat was starting to get  sore  too.&#160; I think that I got it from him, when he came into the center  on Tuesday,  for&#160;a quick visit.&#160;

I told her that I  would be  right there to open up the bathroom.&#160; I took the guys who were  across the street  that I was going into the center for a few minutes  &amp; they said "okay".&#160; I  went into the center to open up the bathroom  for the pregnancy test &amp;

I heard her voice &amp; she was talking loud enough   for me to hear her, for that's what she wanted.&#160; She was saying to the  young man  "I don't want her to say anything to me as I go in there, I  just don't want to  hear it".&#160; I waited for them to cross the street  heading into Planned Parenthood  before I said "we can help you, you  don't have to go in there".&#160; The two voices  that came back to me, were  nasty in tone,&#160;as they both headed for the door.&#160;  About 2 hours later  they walked back out&#160; &amp; I&#160; tried to talk to them again.&#160;  I said for  them to ask the Lord into their lives".&#160; The young man said, to  me,&#160;"I  know&#160;the Lord".&#160; I don't know why I laughed, but I did.&#160; I guess it's   because so many people are saying to me that they know the Lord &amp;  are living  immoral lives &amp; killing their children too, I'm so  confused.&#160; He quickly  replied, to my laughing, by saying to me "go to  hell".&#160; See what I mean??&#160; There  is so much religious hypocrisy.&#160; If  you know the Lord then you will try to do  His Will &amp; obey the 10  Commandments, that He has&#160;given us to live a good  life.&#160; What went  wrong with Society &amp; the Church??&#160; I continued to odder  them help  as they walked up the street &amp; around the corner of Gibb's St.   towards Main St. to catch the bus.&#160; I don't know why they were in there  but she  didn't look good coming out of the Death Camp.&#160; Lord have   Mercy......</span></span></strong></div></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">It  was one car after another coming into the  parking lot, it made my  stomach turn.&#160; An older woman &amp; a young girl got out of  the car  &amp; as they were walking towards the door I still was pleading with   them both not to have the baby killed &amp; that we could help them.&#160;  Then the  young girl turned around at me with a grotesque look on her  face &amp; flipped  me the 'bird'.&#160; It was so very sad.&#160; Then Martha  joined me &amp; started to pray  the Rosary.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Three  girls got out of the car &amp; started to walk into the  building.&#160; As I  offered them help &amp; told them what they did in there, they  were  very disrespectful to us with words &amp; actions, I&#160;can't repeat.&#160; It  was heart  breaking.&#160; If they thought for one moment that they found an  easy target they  learned later on that they were wrong.&#160; Where are  these girls mothers &amp;  fathers??&#160; Does anyone love them???&#160; I know  that we do but it's hard to get  through to them when they are involved  with risky business, like having sex  outside of marriage &amp; they're  not there yet to&#160;change. Some of our girls  will have to hit the 'brick  wall' first before they can get healing.&#160; They all  went in &amp; then a  few minutes later two of the girls&#160;came back to their car.&#160;  I  continued to speak to them because abortion is the first thing that we  speak  about to those who are driving into the parking lot.&#160; If they are  there for an  abortion or not, that's what we address first &amp;  foremost.&#160;We take no chances  &amp; speak about abortion first, which  is&#160;the immediate need to save a life.&#160;  They also do STD testing, &amp;  the insertion of the abortificant the IUD &amp;  the abortificant  the&#160;Depro Provera shot, too on Thursdays.&#160; Then one of the  girls  screamed at me saying "we're here for our friend's STD testing you   --------.&#160; How nice is that, no respect.&#160; I said "that's a consequence  of sin".&#160;  What you -------.&#160; I said back to them that when you sin  there are consequences  of sinning &amp; STD's is one way to pay for  that sin.&#160; Well they didn't like  that to say the least.&#160; As they were  becoming more rowdy &amp; I said to them  that if they continue that I  will call the police.&#160; For they really were getting  out of control  &amp; we need to protect ourselves.&#160; One of the girls hollered  back to  me as she was heading towards me saying "I'll have you arrested for   harassment".&#160; They always say that.&#160; I returned by saying "you're  infringing on  my Constitutional right to protest &amp; my Freedom of  Speech, so who'll have  who arrested"?&#160; I looked through the bushes  again &amp; they had stopped dead in  their tracks &amp; then went back  into the Killing&#160;Mill, Planned Parenthood.&#160;  Good girls, a wise decision  on your part!!&#160; I'm not kidding, for they're killing  babies in there  &amp; most of the&#160;people going in there are up to no good.&#160; Not  all but  most. I love them but I won't be their victim either.&#160; They were in   there for about 15 minutes &amp; when they had come out I heard them say   probably to their girlfriend who was in having the STD testing, "there  she  is"!!!&#160; I didn't confront them as they were pulling out, for I was  busy giving  directions to Focus, for children's clothes, to a father  who had his young son  with him.&#160; So I wasn't near the exit of the  Planned Parenthood parking lot but  they sure had to look at the  pictures that I had on the sidewalk.&#160; I did take a  chance that they  would hear me &amp; I&#160;used the mega phone to call out to them  saying,&#160;  "I love you"!! &#160;It makes me cry to see how some of our young people are   so messed up today.&#160;Thanks for nothing Planned Parenthood, you  deviants.&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Another  tough case, was an African woman  was&#160;getting out of her car &amp; I  engaged her with some very important  information.&#160; I said to her that  Black Genocide was happening here at Planned  Parenthood.&#160; She laughed,  as she was walking into the building.&#160; I said to her  "the Lord isn't  laughing".&#160; Then she got real angry, so I said the Our Father  Prayer.&#160;  She came out, a few minutes later,&#160;holding some of their literature in   her hands, probably about STD's.&#160; She&#160;then came over to the fence, where  I was  standing,&#160;&amp; said to me "are you racist &amp; again, in a low  tone of voice,  are you racist"?&#160; I haven't that response in a long  time, so I said to her "no  I'm not a racist&#160;but Planned Parenthood  is".&#160; Well it was like World War III now  &amp; I couldn't get a word in  edge wise.&#160; So Martha took over &amp; I went back  to the sidewalk, by  the tree, &amp; witnessed the Truth to the cars driving up  &amp; down  University Ave..&#160;&#160;Martha&#160;tried to talk to her but I all I could here   her say was "then why did she say what she said"?&#160; I thought to myself,  because  it's the Truth!!&#160; She was difficult to communicate with but  thank God that  Martha was able to give her a Truth packet,&#160;which has&#160;a  whole lot of information  in it.&#160;There are&#160;some brochures, in the  packet, that&#160;will tell her what I was  trying to tell her, is that  Planned Parenthood is Racist &amp; there is Black  Genocide going on in  there. &#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Check&#160;out</span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">:</span></strong></span><font face="Arial"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://blackgenocide.org/home.html"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160; http://blackgenocide.org/home.htm</span></strong></a></span><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://blackgenocide.org/home.html"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">l</span></strong></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;&amp;&#160;</span></span></strong></span></font><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: large;"><font face="Arial"><a href="http://blackgenocide.org/black.html"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">http://blackgenocide.org/black.html</span></strong></a></font><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> &amp;</span></strong></span></span></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">http://blackgenocide.org/planned.html</span></strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">.</span></span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;   I hope &amp; pray that she will be the woman,  that the Lord will  raise up, to educate the Black Community here in Rochester,  to close  down Planned Parenthood once &amp; for all.&#160; It's the, 'I don't want to   get involved' people &amp; the Churches that keep Planned Parenthood  open, by  not doing anything.&#160; Apathy is killing our children!!!!!&#160;&#160; As  she drove away I  waved at her &amp; hollered.

The little 2 year old&#160;had a mind  if her own. very strong willed.&#160; She ventured into the Great Room &amp; was  starting to touch everything in sight &amp; she didn't like it when I tried to&#160;  stop her from breaking most of the things that she was touching.&#160; I took her by  the hand &amp; said "lets go find Mommy".&#160; &#160;She was having to much fun to care  about Mommy but I finally brought her to her mom.&#160;

witness instead.&#160; I stayed in the center doing  office work &amp; I was joined, soon after, by Karen, our new volunteer.&#160; It was  so nice of her to have brought diapers size 5 which is&#160;what we needed &amp;  other wonderful things,&#160;for our moms. &#160;I asked her to call three doctor offices,  from a list,&#160;that I obtained through a reliable source, to see if they&#160;did  abortions&#160;or referred for abortions. I was happy to find out that Unity doesn't  do or refer for abortions.&#160; Thank God!!&#160; So we have three new doctors to add to  our list of other doctors.&#160; This makes me very happy indeed.&#160; I also gave Karen  another list, that I had recently obtained, to see if these were good sources to  refer our clients to.&#160; She will check to see &amp; then print them out, for the  center to hand out, to those who are in need.&#160; She is so helpful.&#160; She wasn't  feeling well today&#160;so she left a little bit earlier.&#160; She's renewing her  doctor's license &amp; will be hopefully trained to do ultrasounds, for the  three pregnancy centers in the city &amp; hopefully at Focus too.&#160;This is very  exciting news, to say the least.&#160;&#160;&#160;The three Elim girls arrived then Karen  left&#160;to go home, so I had coverage in the center.&#160; I greeted the girls then put  them to work immediately, for there was so much to do.&#160; They have breaks &amp;  lots of fun, so don't get me wrong, it's not all work without play.&#160; We enjoy  them &amp; they enjoy us too.&#160; It's mutual.&#160;&#160;I was trying to do some projects,  &#160;in the office, but I had many interruptions which I understand.&#160; It was either  the phone ringing&#160; or the doorbell.&#160; I dealt with&#160;every situation, through the  grace of God.&#160; I also had to prepare for our first Board Meeting in 2012 tonight  at 6pm.&#160; Martha surprised me yesterday with the news that she had a Nursing  Inservice Meeting tonight from 4pm until 7pm, &amp; wouldn't be joining us at  the board meeting.&#160; I was disappointed, but I have to go on with the bad news,  that I receive continuously.&#160;</span></span></strong><strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I was working on two projects or&#160;maybe it  was&#160;three, at a time.&#160;

The Elim girls were working very hard &amp; then&#160;Martha came  back into the center.&#160; I asked her what had happened out there in the front  lines.&#160; Earlier I had offered my cell phone just in case she had to call the  police or me, in the center, for some immediate&#160;assistance, but she refused the  cell phone.&#160; She said that there was a woman&#160;who said to her that her daughter  had died two&#160;days ago &amp; then went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Shouldn't she  have been preparing for the funeral instead??&#160; So sad.&#160; &#160;Then a guy approached  Martha from around the bushes, to call her a 'bitch" &amp; asked her&#160;"what if a  woman was raped"?&#160; Martha replied saying that it was her baby too.&#160; He said "ya,  I never thought of&#160; it that way before" &amp; then he stopped calling her bad  names.&#160; Just then she said, Cleveland had come walking down the street &amp; she  called him over saying&#160;&#160;"Hi Cleveland".&#160;&#160;"He saved&#160;my life", she said.&#160; God used  Cleveland, to draw attention to himself, so that this nasty man would go away,  which he did.&#160; Thank God.&#160;&#160;&#160;Martha said that she got bad honks &amp; good honks&#160;  today, from the cars driving passed her, on the sidewalk.&#160; It's so puzzling why  anyone would call her&#160;a bad name or disrespect her in any way, for she is  so&#160;wonderful &amp; sweet.&#160; A true mother, she acts like's one &amp; looks like  one, too.&#160; It's quite puzzling to me, that's for sure.&#160; </span></span></strong><strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><p><strong> </strong></p><div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I was happy to see Sandy, who has volunteered in  the past at Focus, before she got a job at the Strong Museum.&#160; She stopped by  the office &amp; we got to talk for a few minutes.&#160; I told her that Paul was  coming by &amp; when I had just said this, there he was.&#160; It was great for them  to see each other again,&#160;for they hadn't seen&#160;one another&#160;in a long time &amp;  they had much to&#160;catch up on as they worked together,&#160;in the Great Room, putting  away the donations.&#160; It was wonderful.&#160; Then the doorbell rang &amp; it was Jim,  who brings us food for our clients,&#160;during Lent every week.&#160; I got to talk to  him, about some deep subject matters,&#160;until he&#160;had to go.&#160; Then we were blessed  by a woman who brought us some diapers &amp; two cans of baby formula, which is  very expensive.&#160; I got to talk to her for a few minutes &amp; said how grateful  I was for her donations.&#160; She just smiled at me, how nice is that.&#160; Then the  doorbell rang again &amp; then Paul said to me " there's someone here to see  you".&#160; The young lady came into the office &amp; I said "what can I do to help  you today"?&#160; She replied "for a pregnancy test".&#160; I said "come follow me in the  Rose Room".&#160; She did &amp; we started the procedure.&#160; I asked to fill out the  Intake Sheet &amp; then got the pregnancy test ready while she was in bathroom  giving me an urine sample for the test.&#160;&#160;Then she came back into the room where  she took the test &amp;&#160;while&#160;we were waiting we talked.&#160; I started to ask he  some questions &amp; Pandora's Box opened up.&#160; &#160;It was sad to hear that she had  just lost her baby son,&#160;by a stillbirth at 6 months.&#160; I told her that my good  friend had lost her baby by a stillbirth at 6 months, many years ago, &amp; that  she named her daughter&#160;Nicole.&#160; She had also named&#160;her son too.&#160; She was  negative today &amp; then we talked about abstinence &amp; she agreed.&#160; She told  her boyfriend that she wasn't to be pure &amp; chaste &amp; he agreed to that.&#160;  How good is that .&#160; She had sad eyes.&#160;&#160;She was a wise young girl with &#160;the right  message that abortion &amp; contraception was wrong.&#160; I told her that sex inside  of marriage was wrong &amp; for her to ask God to forgive her &amp; He will.&#160; At  one point she finally smiled which touched my heart.&#160; I offered her help any  time that she wanted to call me or to come back to Focus to talk, for we were  here for her.&#160;

They were half  sisters,&#160;&amp; they both had a pregnancy test.&#160; One was negative &amp; the other  was positive.&#160; Their both heads were down &amp; when they lifted them up&#160;they  had such a blank look on them.&#160; The young girl, who was pregnant, was 18 years  old &amp; had her life already planned out &amp;&#160;a baby wasn't in the  plans.&#160;&#160;She wasn't&#160;abortion minded before the test but one never knows after the  test, with a positive result.&#160; Sheila asked me to talk with her &amp; her  sister&#160;so I went into the Rose Room&#160;to speak with them, offering them support  &amp; hope.&#160; I said that a baby wasn't&#160;a curse but a blessing &amp;&#160;it's not  cancer or heart disease but a person that God put in your life.&#160; I said "you had  sex &amp; now you have a baby,&#160;that's how it happens".&#160; I again told her that  she wasn't alone &amp; that we were here for her &amp; her baby.&#160; Later on  Sheila showed them the Material Aid Room &amp; I told her that when she finds  out if she's going to have a boy or a girl that she can come back &amp; get what  she needs for the baby &amp; everything is 'free' &amp; that's good thing  right".&#160; I think that I was starting to see a small smile come over her face.&#160;  We gave her a Truth packet &amp; a baby's feet pin at 10 weeks &amp; a DVD &amp;  lots of brochures to assist her, one was "How to Take Care of Yourself&#160;When  Pregnant'.&#160; We always suggest that they go to their own doctor to obtain medical  care during their pregnancy &amp; if they don't have a doctor then we provide a  list of good pro life doctors for them, that have a positive pregnancy test, or  for anyone who doesn't have a doctor.&#160; We are blessed to have added three more  pro life doctors to our list to hand out.&#160;I'm thankful.&#160;Sheila talked to the two  sisters for a few more minutes while I gathered some of the things to take  outside, then she had to met her daughter for lunch.&#160; Paul&#160;was getting a ride  from Tim, to go pick up his car that was in the shop, who was there at the  center picking up the 501c3 letter so that&#160;he can pick up&#160;'free' bread &amp;  rolls,&#160;from Panera Bread @ </strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font size="2"><a href="http://www.panerabread.com/"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>http://www.panerabread.com/</strong></span></a></font><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>, to hand out  to families in need &amp;

Then  there was Kay from St. Pius the Tenth Church, in Chili, delivering baby  formula.&#160; Then there was a nice lady from church delivering some clothes for the  Material Aid Room &amp; later on she hands me a&#160;$50 bill, as a donation for the  center, thank you so very much Lord &amp; Thresy.&#160; Then there was another woman  with a young&#160;daughter, around 4 years old, dropping off some very new &amp; nice  clothes for the Material Aid Room.&#160; After everyone had left I got to talk to her  for a few minutes.&#160; Her husband in a doctor &amp; she has 6 children &amp; when  her youngest daughter is in school she can &amp; help us out in the center.&#160; I  can't wait, literally I can't wait, I need more help now, for we are so busy in  the center &amp;

I saw one of the Taxi guys  so I called him over to help&#160;me &amp; he did.&#160; Just then Martha drove into the  parking lot honking her horn&#160;(to say hi, I guess) &amp; then she parked her car  &amp; got out.&#160; I spotted two girls who looked familiar,&#160;I had spoken to them at  one time&#160;when I was standing out on the front lines, sidewalk counseling.&#160; They  were&#160;not receptive to what I was saying &amp; they&#160;went into Planned Parenthood  anyway,&#160;that day.&#160; I&#160;then called over to them &amp; offered them a 'free'  pregnancy test &amp; I told them that Planned Parenthood kills babies.&#160; They  continued to walk up the sidewalk &amp; then they turned around &amp;&#160;walked  over&#160;to where Martha &amp;&#160;I were standing, in the parking lot.&#160; Martha then  lead them into the center for&#160;a pregnancy test.&#160; I saw the hand&#160;of God in this.&#160;  As Martha was in the center I was still outside &amp; then a pro lifer, named  Chris, who prays in front of Planned Parenthood on Tuesdays, thank God,  approached me to ask for 4 more Truth packets.&#160; Sure I said&#160;&amp; I then went  into the center to get them for her.&#160;She is pro-active &amp; hands them out to  the girls, walking pass her,&#160;on the sidewalk while praying.&#160;Yeah!!&#160; Since Martha  &amp; I find it difficult to get out on the front lines on Tuesdays, we have  Chris out there at least, thank God.&#160; Just before Chris had left in her car I  noticed two young girls, one young man &amp; two young children walking up Gibbs  St. to University,&#160; I called over to them offering them 'free' baby&#160; &amp;  children clothes &amp; 'free' pregnancy tests too.&#160; They walked across the  street &amp; followed me into the center.&#160; I then waved good bye to Chris, who  was now driving out of the parking lot, to go home.&#160; I lead them into the  Material Aid Room &amp; told the one girl who wanted a pregnancy test that  someone else was in the room &amp; she had to wait for a little while.&#160; So in  the meantime to go shopping in&#160;the Material Aid Room, which she did.&#160; I heard  her&#160;say to&#160;the other girl that was with her saying "they're right next to  Planned Parenthood".&#160; I then interjected saying "Planned Parenthood kills&#160;babies  &amp; they're trying to kill your race off too".&#160; I then handed them each a  Truth packet.&#160; I then went into the office &amp; I was wondering why it was  taking Martha so long.&#160; That usually means&#160;a positive pregnancy test &amp; one  has to spent more time with a client that is positive, especially if she's  abortion minded or in shock.&#160; This was the later situation, for her pregnancy  test was positive &amp; she was in shock &amp; was crying &amp;&#160;was sorry that  she had had sex.&#160; Martha spent time with her &amp; her friend talking to them  &amp; giving them lots of information to take with them to look at&#160;&amp; also a  DVD of Growth &amp; Development, in the womb, &amp; ultrasound pictures too.&#160; I  feel so badly that the moms are already rejecting their babies.&#160;Suzanne, our  client advocate on Thursdays,&#160;will follow up on this client as she does with all  our clients, if their pregnancy test is positive.&#160; I notice that the people  that&#160;just came into the Material Aid Room &amp; wanted a pregnancy test had  left.&#160; I quickly went to the front door &amp; saw them walking away.&#160; I called  over to them saying that Planned Parenthood kills babies &amp; that they don't  care about you but we do".&#160; The one girl said that she was going to bring the  kids back home &amp; then come back.&#160; I said "okay".&#160; My heart sank because they  were going in the opposite direction that I first saw them coming from.&#160; I  thought that they were going to Planned Parenthood to get the test &amp; never  come back but thank God I was wrong.&#160; It was about 15 minutes later that  the&#160;doorbell rang &amp; there were the two girls.&#160; the one girl said "here we  are for I told you that we'd be back".&#160; I said "great".&#160; Martha was&#160; just  finishing up&#160;with the two girls that we first brought into the center, for a  pregnancy test.&#160;&#160;I can't help to wonder if they&#160;had gone over to Planned  Parenthood for&#160;a pregnancy test &amp; they wouldn't do it &amp; then they gave  the two children to the young man to take home.&#160; Never the less they were  back&#160;at Focus.&#160; That's all I cared about.&#160; Martha lead the two girls into  the&#160;Rose Room &amp; shut the door.</strong></span></span></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font></div><div><font size="2" face="Arial">&#160;</font></div><p><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font></p><div><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: medium"><strong>The doorbell rang &amp;

She&#160;was accused, by her cousin,&#160;for stealing&#160;the  diapers that she just got at the center, the same day.&#160; Oh, no not again.&#160;Then  the&#160;doorbell rang again &amp; it was this young girl's cousin now coming into  the center after I told her that she needed to come alone, the next time she  comes to Focus,&#160;&amp; not to take so much&#160;from the Material Aid Room, this time,  for we need to make sure that there is enough for everybody who comes into the  center.&#160; "Hi Miss Mary", she says.&#160; Okay so I'm a big softy.&#160;Then she goes to  greet her cousin in the Material Aid Room.&#160; When the two young girls left  the&#160;Rose Room, after the pregnancy test, they passed by&#160;the Material Aid Room  &amp;&#160;said to the one girl that was in there saying,&#160;"why are you here"?&#160;

Karen was staring to do her work already for she sees  something that needs to be done &amp; does it, like all the volunteers at  Focus.&#160; I said good bye to the both of them &amp; went outside.&#160; I was there for  about 5 minutes when two women walked around the bushes onto the sidewalk where  I was standing.&#160; One woman was young (the daughter) &amp; the other woman was  older (the mom).&#160; As they walked passed me I said "we're here to help you &amp;  there is a pregnancy center right around the corner to your right".&#160; The older  woman responded "no need, it's to late".&#160; "What do you mean", I asked.&#160; She  replied "she just had an abortion".&#160; "What", I screamed, "why didn't you do  something to stop it"?&#160; She turned her head around slightly &amp; spoke in a  soft voice saying "she's my daughter, I have to give her support".&#160; I said  "supporting her in having your grandchild killed, what's the matter with you"!&#160;  I went on &amp; on until they were half way down the street.&#160; I'm sure that I  told both of them to repent for the sin of murder &amp; that she, the mother to  the girl who had the abortion, that she was an accomplice to this murder of her  own grandchild.&#160; I was in shock &amp; I just wanted to bury myself in a hole  some where&#160;but I couldn't.&#160; I then walked back to my&#160;post, by the tree, &amp;  then there were two cars, almost back to back, coming out of the parking lot  saying bad things to me &amp; expressing that they just had had an abortion.&#160;  One car had four people in it &amp; I told all of them that they were  accomplices to murder &amp; to repent, for Hell&#160;is forever.&#160; No&#160;cliché but the  Truth.&#160; Nothing but.......&#160; I felt like someone had shot me three times &amp; I  was stumbling.&#160; I now wanted to go into the center &amp; never come out on the  front lines again.&#160; I was just waiting until Martha or/ and Pastor Everett to  come &amp; I will escape, to the peace of the pregnancy center, where we're not  killing any children.&#160; That just didn't happen. I was suppose to stay &amp;  trust in God,&#160;during this&#160;most difficult time.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I continued in the spiritual&#160;battle, for lives  &amp; souls, until Martha came on the sidewalk, to pray.&#160; Then Adolf &amp; Dan  came to pray across the street.&#160; A car stopped by Bill to where he was sitting  with the graphic sign Malachi.&#160; I later found out that she told him that she had  had an abortion in the past &amp; was offended at the picture.&#160; It sure sounds  like she's repented.&#160; Not!!&#160; Yea lady it all about you &amp; not the precious  baby that you had killed in a violent way.&#160;I hope &amp; pray that she really,  truly&#160;repents very soon.&#160; Don't put off tomorrow what you should do today!!!&#160; I  spoke&#160; with Martha briefly &amp; then asked her to pray on the brick side of  Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said okay &amp; got the mega phone &amp; the Truth  packet, with the poem in it, to read to the mothers sitting in the waiting room,  of the killing mill.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Later she told me that a car had stopped to where  she was &amp; said that she lived down the street &amp; because of all the noise  she couldn't do her gardening.&#160; Boo hoo, too bad.&#160; They're murdering children in  here &amp; all you care about is your stupid gardening.&#160; What a nut case.&#160;Martha  said that it got heated &amp; the woman&#160;told Martha to shut up &amp; then Martha  told her to shut up.&#160; You go girl......&#160; I was so busy where I was that I didn't  see a car stop &amp; talk to Martha.&#160; I do have a cell phone &amp; I'm not  afraid to use it.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Just then I saw a young girl walking up the  sidewalk towards me.&#160; I said to her that we can help her if she's going into  Planned Parenthood.&#160; She stopped &amp; said, so matter of fact, "yes I am, I'm  going for an abortion".&#160; I looked at her &amp; said "you're not going in there  to have your nails don, you're going in there to have you baby killed".&#160;&#160;Then I  reached into the plastic bag to retrieve the little 10 week old baby t show her  saying "this is what&#160;your baby looks like, are you going to kill him or her".&#160;  "I'm good" she replied.&#160; As she walked passed the graphic signs I quickly showed  the pictures &amp; said "are you going to do this to your precious baby"?&#160; As  she entered the parking lot she turned her head back at me &amp; said "I can't  afford a baby".&#160; I said "we have a pregnancy center &amp; we can help you during  &amp; after your baby is born".&#160; She didn't go right in for she sat on the bench  by the door for about 5 minutes.&#160; I crossed over to the other side of the street  &amp; called out to her &amp; pleaded&#160;with her not to have her baby killed.&#160; I  walked over to where Martha was standing &amp; pleaded some more.&#160; She went into  the building.&#160; I went over to the other side where I usually stand but now I was  numb.&#160; Martha came over to where I was now &amp; I told her that I needed to go  into the center.&#160; But before I went I told Martha to watch out for a African  American young girl with medium length hair, for she was in there having an  abortion, she told me.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; I left to regain my strength.&#160; I  was in the center talking to Suzanne about some things that were center &amp;  client related &amp; then I had a quick sandwich &amp; went back outside to join  Martha&#160;&amp; now Pastor Everett, who was now on the sidewalk.&#160; Thank God!!&#160; I  greeted the Pastor &amp; then I turned to Martha &amp; asked her if the young  girl had come out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She hesitated for a few seconds, which  seemed like an eternity &amp; then said "yes, yes she did".&#160; I said "what!  please tell me all about it".&#160; She said that when she had walked by her she  remembered what&#160;I had said to her before I went into the center.&#160; She called her  over&#160;&amp; offered her the Truth packet.&#160; She said "no, that's okay".&#160; Mother  Martha looked at her &amp; said "you come over here &amp; take this packet".&#160;  She walked over to Martha &amp; took it.&#160; Then Martha asked her name &amp; she  said "Eva", which was my grandmother's name, &amp; she smiled at Martha &amp;  then walked down the street.&#160; Martha did tell me that she&#160;was carrying&#160;a brown  paper bag with a long box in it.&#160; I said, the only thing that I can&#160;imagine it  might be&#160;was the Plan B.&#160; Maybe when she got in there she changed her mind &amp;  they gave her the Plan B to be used to abort her baby.&#160; Never the less she  didn't have a surgical abortion &amp; she took the packet of information, which  will continue to tell her the truth, if she reads it, &amp; not to take any  pills that is used to kill her baby.&#160; I feel good about Eva, that she choose  life today, &amp; we will see her again with her baby.&#160;I offered my pain, of the  three women who had come out earlier, after they had killed their children, to  save Eva's baby.&#160; God used my suffering &amp; pain &amp; heartache &amp; horror,  for this incident.&#160; He does that.&#160; Amen.&#160; </span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I continued to sidewalk counsel.&#160; Then a young,  white woman, came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walked briskly passed me.&#160; I  said something to her &amp; she pointed to her ear phones with a pleasant smirk  on her face.&#160; I said to her "I have just one word for you, "bondage".&#160; She  responded like she did hear me.

I called over to them saying "this is wonderful news &amp;  we have 'free' baby clothes at 86 University Ave.," as they were pulling out  onto the street.&#160; It was nice that she stopped to tell us of the change of  heart, Praise God, through His grace always.&#160; All three of us were screaming  with such joy at the news that this baby was saved from being killed here  today.&#160; We all three were so excited that not one of us thought to give the  young girl a truth packet &amp;

I'm trying to save as many  babies as I can, through the grace &amp; guidance from God, in honor of my twin  brother Jimmy,&#160;who was aborted".&#160; I just didn't have the time, for she walked  very fast &amp; was half way down the street, in a matter of seconds.&#160; I will  pray for her &amp; hope that she will realize what she's done &amp; repents.&#160; So  many young girls are following in her footsteps &amp;

his role is to protect  women&#160;&amp; children.&#160; I also told him that he as a man will be held  more&#160;accountable, in the eyes of God, because God created men to protect us  &amp; children too.&#160;

Earlier I had received a call form a young woman  that said that the Salvation Army had referred her to Focus, for baby things,  for she only had a crib &amp; really nothing else.&#160; I told her when&#160;we will be  at the center today, from 1pm to 6pm, even though&#160;I usually&#160;stay later, in the  center.&#160; She said that she would&#160;come in the afternoon.&#160; I said fine &amp; then  asked her her name &amp; then I said "I'll see you later" &amp; hung up.&#160; Well,  I was in the center &amp; received a call on my cell &amp; the person was saying  that she was in the parking lot of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said "what, you need  to get out of their parking lot so what I'll do is&#160;I'll walk over to the  sidewalk in front of that building &amp; when you pull out make a right &amp;  you'll see me there &amp; then I'll show you where we're located, which is two  doors down.&#160; I kept her on the phone &amp; I walked over to the Planned  Parenthood &amp; I guided her over to where Focus was.&#160; Yeah!&#160; She had her  boyfriend with her &amp; the two came into Focus where I asked Martha to take  over to assist them in the Material Aid Room &amp; to fill out an Intake Sheet  so that Suzanne can call her at times to see if she needs anything.&#160; She's due  in May, so we have a little time, to get what she will need for her baby.&#160;  Martha told me later on that they were very nice &amp; were grateful for the  baby clothes &amp; for the help.&#160; That's our job!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Karen had just come in, so I asked her to do some  office work today.&#160; She typed out the Doctor's List,&#160;to pass out to our  clients.&#160; It was updated with two new doctors that do not do or refer for  abortions.&#160;Great!!!&#160; I'm so happy.&#160; She also made copies of our updated general  referral list.&#160; She is a blessing.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was Donna, a client that we haven't seen in  awhile since her boyfriend had thrown her down the stairs but she recovered.&#160;  When I saw her today I was hoping for good news but she said that her ex  boyfriend had broken into her apartment,&#160;last night,&#160;while she &amp; her son  were away &amp; he put bleach on her carpet &amp; ripped up her furniture &amp;  destroyed the apartment.&#160; How sick is that.&#160;Martha got her connected with  someone from the R.A.I.H.N program&#160;@ </span></span><a href="http://www.raihn.org/"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">http://www.raihn.org/</span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;for a place for her &amp;  her son to live.&#160; She has to call them tomorrow again.&#160; She went into the  Material Aid Room to get some things for herself &amp; for her son too.&#160; Just  then the doorbell rang &amp; it was Pastor Everett &amp; he was there to tell me  that he would be late, on the front lines tomorrow, for he has a funeral  tomorrow morning at 11am.&#160; I introduced Donna to the Pastor &amp; he spoke with  her for a little while .&#160; Then he said "lets all gather together &amp; pray".&#160;  That's a great idea.&#160; So I called&#160; everyone into the&#160;Green Room, the 3  Elim&#160;girls, Martha, Paul &amp; we all held hands in a circle &amp; prayed for  each other &amp; for Donna &amp; her son &amp; their situation.&#160;&#160; It was such a  blessing.&#160;<div class="imageElement"><img src="http://www.therealside.com/upload/photo/1stshowpic2.jpg" alt="" title="What the Mainstream Media Will never tell you about prayer!" style="width: 155px;

getting out the  summer clothes into the Material Aid Room.&#160; We are so busy doing this.&#160; We had a  grandmother come in with her two grandchildren that she takes care of to get  some things for them.&#160; I gave her a general&#160;Referral List &amp; a Food Pantry  List too.&#160; She wants to volunteer at Focus but I can't see how she can with&#160;the  responsibilities that she has with the two young grandchildren.&#160; It was nice  that she wanted to.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Paul had the back door open for he was cleaning a stroller that was given  to us by one of our clients.&#160; Unfortunately it was too dirty to do anything with  so we decided to throw it out.&#160; While I was in the back of the building I  decided to walk over to the fence to confront any Planned Parenthood staffer  that was there in the parking lot.&#160; I saw one in her car.&#160;&#160;She got out of her  car &amp; started to walk to the building.&#160; I told her what I thought &amp; said  that what she was doing, in there, was so wrong &amp; evil.&#160; She just mockingly  tilted her head, back &amp; forth, as if to say "lodi dotty doe".&#160; Poor woman,  she just didn't get it.&#160; I then saw the car that I wanted the license number  &amp; I got it.&#160; The car was right in front of my face, I couldn't ask for  anything better.&#160;I couldn't believe it.&#160; I thought that she might be the other  abortionist but I feel now that she's just one of the 'Staffer's for Death', at  Planned Parenthood.&#160; We might consider to protest in the ally way behind our  building for it faces the PP parking lot.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martha &amp; I had a nice chicken &amp; sausage supper with mashed potatoes  &amp; peas.&#160; She had to go early for she didn't get much sleep last night for  her daughter called her at 10pm to come right over to take care of her  grandchildren for she &amp; her husband needed to go to the hospital for she was  having troubling breathing.&#160; So Martha had very little sleep last night &amp;  she was tired &amp; she didn't know if her daughter would call tonight asking  for her to come over.&#160; Please pray for&#160;Martha &amp; her daughter. Also, please  pry for all our clients &amp; for those women &amp; girls that changed their  minds that they will stay strong &amp; for all the staff at Focus &amp; those  who are on the front lines &amp; for our wonderful benefactors who bless us, all  the time.&#160; Thank you so much!!&#160; :)</span></span></div></font></div></div></strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><hr /></span></span></div><p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;PLEASE&#160;GO&#160;TO&#160;NEXT&#160;PAGE</span></span></strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>!&#160; PAGE 15.
