of clothes, for the moms, at the center.&#160; Thanks Karen.&#160; As I was talking to Karen, Sheila came into the center from the front lines.&#160; She told me that a girl had left Planned

doorbell, for our clients to go into the Material Aid Room to get the things that they need for their children.&#160; Suzanne was busy in the office calling our clients to see how they were doing

baby.&#160; I never saw so many people with the mind set for murder.&#160;&#160;I called over to the people coming &amp; going saying "you clump of tissue, you are all alive &amp; walking around

tissue.&#160; I just wanted them to wake up &amp; get real.&#160; Just then I received a phone call from a woman, who wanted to check out the front lines, that Martha &amp; I met at the Maafa 21: Black Genocide in the 21st.Century, which was shown about 2 weeks ago, on a Saturday, at the building across from Bethel Church.&#160; By the way where are they on the front lines????&#160; She called

show her around.&#160; She said&#160; "okay" &amp; I lead her there.&#160; I talked with her in the Rose Room where she told me that she was pregnant with twins.&#160; I said "great", we can help you with both of your children.&#160; She said that she had another child, a little girl age 3, &#160;that the father has custody of, because of her financial woes.&#160; I then preceded to offer all

did.&#160; Then I talked&#160;with her for 10 minutes &amp; then brought her into the Material Aid Room to get some books for her daughter.&#160; She told me that her daughter reads to her, so I was anxious to give her many books, to take with her.&#160; She was grateful.&#160; I said "good bye &amp; that we will&#160;be praying for her too".&#160; She said "thank you" &amp; off she went to get a

wanted her too, before I left with this young&#160;girl to&#160; go to Focus,&#160;but she refused.&#160; Stubborn!!&#160; &#160;I then decided to go across the street with the graphic sign.&#160; I

bothering us, for at least a year, why now are you starting up again????&#160; Silly middle aged old bat.&#160; What part of "leave us alone" don't you understand???&#160;&#160;You might think that

she still thinks that I'm #1, but I'm really not.&#160; A car had now stopped in front of her house &amp; an older woman got out, &amp; of course she greeted her with a hug &amp; a big smile.&#160; It

As this was all happening I decided to go outside &amp; take some pictures in the neighborhood, &amp; off I went .&#160; The only regret is that I didn't bring a Truth packet with me.&#160; When I got outside I saw the landlord Bernie &amp; he told me that the Ethiopian restaurant was leaving &amp; he had someone else t rent the space.&#160; It will be a restaurant that will be serving in the evening &amp; it will have music too.&#160; Okay, but I was surprised at this new change.&#160; I walked around the block &amp; took some pictures.&#160; I ended up on the brick side of Planned Parenthood &amp; confronted two young girls that were about to go into Planned Parenthood.&#160; They walked over to me on the sidewalk &amp; spoke with them for about a minute.&#160; I was so upset that I didn't have a Truth packet to give them.&#160; They both walked into Planned Parenthood to have their lives ruined.&#160; How sad is that??&#160; I then walked over to the other side of the sidewalk where I usually stand by the bushes &amp; started to talk to the people going in.&#160; I noticed that a woman had two children &amp; I thought that she was putting them into the van &amp; then I saw that she was walking into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I couldn't see clearly because of the bushes in my way if she had the two children with them.&#160; I was so frustrated &amp; I was waiting for a police car to drive down the street &amp; I was going to stop the car &amp; ask the officer to check the gray van for children in it.&#160; I waited &amp; waited by no police was coming down the street.&#160; Then a man was getting into his car that was parked by the bushes &amp; I started to talk to him.&#160; He said that he was on his lunch hour &amp; he was just dropping off his friend.&#160; I asked if it was a STD testing &amp; he said "yes".&#160; I told him about Compass Care &amp; he said that he would pass this information onto&#160; his friend.&#160; Then I asked him if he would just walk over to the gray van two cars down from him to see if there was any children in it.&#160; He stated that he didn't want&#160;to get involved in anything like that.&#160; I said that I would be the one to get involved not you just let me know if there is any kids in the van &amp; then I'll take it from there.&#160; He said "why don't you go check to see"?&#160; I said that there was an injunction &amp; I couldn't pass over this yellow line so that's why I asked you.&#160; He said "sorry".&#160; I said "it will bother you that you didn't do anything".&#160; He then drove way.&#160; I decided to walk across the street, which was prompted by the Holy Spirit, &amp; I saw that there was a woman sitting on a bench, by the door, with the two children.&#160; I felt better

out of the refrigerator &amp; they all sang Happy Birthday to me.&#160; Wow, I couldn't ask for anything better.&#160; Great cake Martha, my favorite, chocolate.&#160; Then they all got&#160;to work making up Truth packets &amp; putting away clothes in the Material Aid Room &amp; assisting our clients too.&#160; It was a pleasant afternoon in the center.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><hr

&amp; he told me that he couldn't come back because he had to work on his house some more.&#160; I understood.&#160; I was in such a tizzy that I really only got a chance to say "good bye" to Sheila &amp; nothing more.&#160; I felt badly about that.&#160; I was hoping that Pastor Everett was going to come early today but I was wrong because he didn't come at all.&#160; He had to sign for his new church, he was very busy with that &amp; getting ready for his son's wedding on Saturday.&#160; I was of course disappointed, for he is used by God in a powerful way, on the front lines.&#160; I was now on the sidewalk, by myself, for Martha was in the center helping out one of our clients &amp; Karen was with one of our clients at Compass Care getting an ultrasound &amp; Suzanne doesn't arrive until 1:30 or later.&#160; I was standing there on the sidewalk &amp; there was hardly any cars, in the parking lot, &#160;but I'm not fooled by that for I know that things can change very quickly at Planned Parenthood, which it did.&#160; It was about 5 minutes later&#160;when one, two, three cars drove into the parking lot one after another.&#160; It made me physically sick to my stomach.&#160; Thank God that Martha had just joined me, on the sidewalk, otherwise I might have passed out from the shock.&#160; I called out to the people getting out of their cars, pleading with them not&#160;to have their baby killed here today.&#160; One hollered back at me saying that she didn't have the money to raise the baby.&#160; I called out to her that there was adoption &amp; that murder wasn't the answer &amp; that there&#160;are many pregnancy centers that could help her, too&#160; She just smirked &amp; went into the building to do the gasterly thing.&#160; She probably was trying to just play me because that's what some of these girls do.&#160; Evil isn't pretty.....</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size:

the girls that were determined to kill their children &amp; ruin their lives here today.&#160; It's&#160;a living Hell to be out there,&#160;on the front lines, but necessary.&#160;

Martha, who was closer to them than I was.&#160; Then I heard the young man say to Martha to "shut up".&#160; I hollered over to him to watch his mouth &amp; to show respect to this wonderful woman.&#160; Then I decided to take his picture on my cell phone.&#160; He called over to me saying "it's against the law to take my picture".&#160; I said "no it isn't".&#160; Then he saw that there was a police officer getting into his car, at out parking lot, where we have our center.&#160; The police was called by our landlord to the Ethiopian restaurant to make out a report, for he was suing them for whatever reason.&#160; So the young kid walked over to the policeman &amp; stood there talking to him for a few minutes.&#160; At this pint the other young girl walked over to us being mouthy then the older woman, who was on the phone, walked over to where I was standing, too.&#160; They were trying to&#160;make me believe, that they had to do this, meaning an&#160;abortion.&#160; I said "never does any woman have to have an abortion &amp; you are all greatly mistaken".&#160; The young man walked back over to his family of 'deathers'.&#160; As he walked by me I said "I told you that it wasn't against the law".&#160; A few minutes later the young girl came over to me with her camera &amp; said "then I'll take your picture too".&#160; Go ahead you baby killers, I don't care.&#160; Later on when she sees the picture that she took, she'll see that&#160;there were two of us in the photo, one was me &amp; the other was the graphic&#160;picture, of an aborted baby, that I was holding.&#160; When they look at the picture they will see what they did to their&#160;precious baby, that nobody wanted, in this family of four.&#160; How evil!&#160; Later on when the girl came out of Planned Parenthood, I noticed that she looked&#160;like the other girl who was harassing me,&#160;so I wonder if they were twins?&#160; She just smiled at me as the car left the parking lot &amp; I called over to them saying "you were all involved in a murder here today &amp; you, the mother, will be held more accountable, for this crime.&#160; Who's smiling now...... You ruined your family mom, now what do you have to say for yourself.&#160; The family dynamics will be intolerable for a very long time.&#160; I hope that they find God!!</strong></span></span></div><div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Martha went into the center to get warmed up &amp; Addison, Dan &amp; Bill had gone so it was Adolf, who was across the street &amp;myself on the other side of the street.&#160; A car with a guy &amp; a girl, in it,&#160;just pulled into the parking lot.&#160; I called over to them about what Planned Parenthood was doing &amp; that we can help them.&#160; Then all of a sudden I saw through the trees that the girl was walking over to me with a very brisk walk.&#160; I was near the fence so I felt trapped.&#160; I quickly got out my cell phone to let her know that I won't hesitate to call 911.&#160; She got close to my face &amp; said "they do so many good things in here &amp; they found my sister's cancer".&#160; I said back to her that any doctor would have found her sister's cancer &amp; that they were evil, evil, evil.&#160; I know how to not aggravate an already aggravated person, right.&#160; Then she said a bad word to me &amp; it looked like she was just about to take a swing at me when the guy she was with came around the bushes &amp;&#160; from the back, lifted her off the ground, &amp; carried her away.&#160; I quickly took her picture before she was gone.&#160; He brought her into Planned Parenthood, oh yea, just what this poor girl needed.&#160; As he was carrying her off, I said to him, "if she's going&#160;for an abortion, she'll be worse than she is now, do you want that"?&#160;&#160;Oh my!!&#160; One never knows what people will do, out on the front lines, that's&#160;for sure.&#160;&#160;But the good Lord protected me once again, thank you!!&#160; When they drove away I saw that her head was down.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she didn't have an abortion.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Martha came out just as they were going into Planned Parenthood &amp; I told her what had just happened.&#160; I'm glad that it was me &amp; not her!&#160; The girls were coming out after their abortions now.&#160; On was eating French Fries, that her mother brought her, when she came to pick her up.&#160; Probably a thank you gift for killing her grandchild.&#160; You sicko...&#160; Another girl was on the phone &amp; another girl&#160;gave me her middle finger.&#160; How sad this all is?</strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>There was another abortionist there today, it wasn't Racheal Phelps.&#160; She wasn't there all week except on Monday, Rob said, for that is his day to be out on the front lines, sidewalk counseling.&#160; I can only hope that she'll repent.

We can't be in two places at once.&#160; Martha &amp; I were coning out of church at 12:45 &amp; in the parking lot we met a woman named Angel.&#160; Martha was giving her directions to how to get to the pregnancy center &amp; I was giving her a Rosary.&#160; I asked Martha if she would drive her over to Focus &amp; she said "okay".&#160; We all arrived at the center at the same time.&#160; Angel was getting some nice things for her child when Karen came in to help.&#160; Just then the doorbell rang &amp; it was the couple that had called me earlier in the morning wanting a pregnancy test.&#160; Karen was asked to administer it for the client.&#160; The test was negative &amp; the couple were disappointed but they need to be married before stating their family at 17.&#160; Education is so vital to our Focus Center.&#160; While Karen was in the Rose Room, doing a pregnancy test, the doorbell rang again &amp; there were two women &amp; a young boy.&#160; The one woman wanted to go to the Material Aid Room &amp; the other woman wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; So after Karen had finished with the one pregnancy test she was doing another one.&#160; This one was negative &amp; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; some abstinence brochures to take with her.&#160; Karen wanted to orientate herself to the Rose Room literature tables, so that she could give the proper brochure,&#160;for the right circumstance.&#160; She also called for Focus to receive more brochures from the Healthy Start Program, which is located next to St. Mary's Hospital.&#160; They have parenting classes for our moms.&#160; I talked to Karen about our future summer workshop @ Focus, for our clients, which she will discuss: Nutrition, Parenting Information, Abstinence, Self Esteem &amp; STD's.&#160; Can't wait!!!&#160; She is such a blessing to us as, all our volunteers are.&#160; I want to do more in the community &amp; at Focus in promoting the Truth to people about Abortion, Planned Parenthood, abstinence, self respect &amp;

as I was about to hang up the door bell rang &amp; I said to Pastor Everett "I&#160;think that&#160;he has just arrived".&#160;&#160;I introduced my self to him &amp; we were on a roll after that.&#160; He was quite a character with a fine sense of humor.&#160; I introduced him to Martha &amp; they hit it off too.&#160; I went over to Mack's, the store next to us at Focus,&#160;to get both Martha &amp;

He said that he would&#160;email me some information, so I'm looking forward to receiving it.&#160;&#160;Pastor Everett stayed for a few more minutes before his ride came to pick him up.&#160; He said that he will be coming, on the front lines tomorrow, thank God.&#160; After Joe &amp; Pastor Everett had left Martha went to the music store, to get a music rack for our Masses, so that the Lector &amp; the Priest could put the Lectionary down on it to read, rather than holding it.&#160;

She left with some good information about the way God wants her to live. When only Chris and I were there praying, a car with four young women drove in. Two went in, and one came around the bushes. We offered her a packet of information and she said she came over to argue with us, but we looked too “nice” to argue with. We both answered with a smile, that we would be glad to argue with her. She seemed to really connect with Chris. She laughed, and began to tell us why she was here. She said both girls who went in are pregnant. One wants to have her baby, and the other isn’t sure, because she already has one child .Chris talked to her about the horrible truth of abortion….murder…. and told her that we have a pregnancy center down the street where we can help her friend. We can direct her to the agencies she needs, and said we have children’s clothes we give away free. When her friend who was waiting outside with her heard that, she also came around the bushes, and said she has children. We invited her to come over sometime. They said they would talk to their friend and then drove away. Ten minutes later they came back, picked up the two who were in PP, and stopped to talk to us. They told us the girl who was undecided, had decided not to have an abortion. They all took packets, and promised to pray for us.

Thank God that I got some other sources for our printing for I must have smelled a rat a long time ago.&#160; Last year he came over to where Martha &amp; I were standing on the sidewalk, to tell us not to feed Cleveland, our street person, because he was bad for business.&#160; Then he told Martha that he was doing business with Planned Parenthood by doing their printing.&#160; He was now accepting 'Blood Money'.&#160; I really haven't seen him since last years confrontation, until today.&#160;

called 911.&#160;He said to the 911 operator that there was a woman using a mega phone slandering me, what would you have me do'?&#160;&#160;Then he said "she's still talking to me."&#160; All I was saying was that when I had spoken to him I was not using the mega phone &amp;

What a duffer doff.&#160; I have better things to do then to deal with you.&#160; I confronted him &amp; he was convicted &amp; he didn't like that &amp; either do the people going into Planned Parenthood or the people driving by us, on the sidewalk.&#160;

All four men had a nice 'men talk'&#160; wow!!&#160; I wanted my say but as I entered the street to cross over to the other side the police cars were moving.&#160; I was in the middle of the street when Officer Mike, who was going fast, had turned on his flash lights.&#160;

He also told Pastor Everett that he was a Catholic.&#160; I wish that he wouldn't tell anyone that because it's scandalous.&#160; No Catholic should come against another Catholic, who is defending life.&#160;

brain waves &amp; separate DNA.&#160; That you  &amp; your baby will feel pain &amp; women do die from abortions too.&#160; They went  in never the less.&#160; Another car, then another car, went into the parking lot.&#160;&#160;I  called out to each &amp;

They walked back to the front door of the  Abortion Mill, so that they could hold the door open, for more&#160;women &amp; girls  &amp; their accomplices,&#160;to kill. &#160;How sick, how evil!!&#160;

She said that she was going in for birth control.&#160; I then told her about  STD's &amp; breast cancer &amp; heart disease too.&#160; I pointed to her big chest  &amp; said "do want your breasts cut off someday because you're using birth  control?&#160; I mentioned the side affects of the Depo shot too, which causes  osteoporosis, the thinning of the bones thus causing fractures at any time.

a man,  who looked like the two girls father, got out of the truck &amp;walked into  Planned Parenthood.&#160; He was so cold &amp; matter of fact in his body language.&#160;  About an hour later he walked out with the one daughter while the other daughter  was still in there.&#160; It could have been his young wife, I don't know.&#160; They  walked to the truck &amp; then walked back inside a few minutes later.&#160; It was  about another hour later that the other young girl came out with the man &amp;  woman &amp; she went into the back seat of the truck, not looking so good.&#160; Lord  have mercy on these family &amp; him especially.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>A car just pulled into the parking lot &amp; an  older woman &amp; an younger girl &amp; a young male got out of the car.&#160; She  parked near where I was standing by the fence.&#160; When they all got out of the car  I called over to them saying that they kill babies here &amp; that there was  help for them.&#160; The older woman said to me "I'm here for a job".&#160; I said "why  would you degrade yourself &#160;by working at an abortion mill"?&#160; I knew that she  was being sarcastic.&#160; This was not good, as she was walking the young girl &amp;  guy, into the chambers of horrors.&#160; It was about&#160; minutes later she came out  &amp; sat on the bench by the door.&#160; I just continued to talk &amp; talk &amp;  talk to her.&#160; She got up &amp; went to her car &amp; moved it closer to the  front door.&#160; It was two hours later when the young girl came out &amp; got into  the car that was convent for her to get into.&#160; As they were driving out I said  to the driver that she will be held more accountable for&#160;what had&#160;happened here  today.&#160; </strong></span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A group of teenagers, with their teacher, walked by  me on the sidewalk &amp; as they passed by me one of the girls said "oh that's  discussing".&#160; I replied that these pictures are the pictures of dead babies  that an abortionist had killed so be respectful".&#160; As the teacher walked by  me &#160;looked at him &amp; said "teach your students the value of life".&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I thought that the horror of the day was finished, for it was now about  6pm, but I was wrong.&#160; A car had pulled into the parking lot with two young  girls in it.&#160; I knew because of the hour that they weren't going in for an  abortion.&#160; They were combative &amp; nasty right away.&#160; At this point I  should&#160;have gone into the center to do my work in there but no not me I had to  stay outside to do battle with these two very angry females.&#160; I was just trying  to get through to them, to&#160;help change their lives, &amp; for them to start  over, so that they could have a better life, in Christ.&#160; When they got out of  the car I started to talk to them in love &amp; truth but they wanted no part of  either so when they finally came out of Planned Parenthood I decided not to say  anything to them as they were driving out.&#160; I stood there just holding the  graphic sign of the poor aborted baby.&#160; Then I heard the one girl say, "oh,  you're not talking to us now, what about if a girl was raped"?&#160; I put the sign  down from my face &amp; said to the two girls that the baby shouldn't be killed  for the crime of the father".&#160; The passenger replied back to me that he wasn't  the father!!&#160; Then she said that there was a child in the back seat.&#160;I couldn't  see if this was true or not &amp;&#160;I said "then why would you bring a child to a  killing mill"?&#160; </strong></span></span><div bgcolor="#ffffff"><div><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The one girl kept on saying the F word &amp; I told  her to stop it, for we will have to make an account someday before God,&#160;of  every word that comes&#160;out of&#160;our mouths.&#160; And I told her that it  meant 'rape' &amp; what was she saying to me?????&#160; She asked me how many  children I had.&#160; I never answered her.&#160; I told her earlier that I was  gang raped &amp; conceived twins so I thought that I needed not to say that  again to her for she was so angry &amp; she really wasn't listening to me.&#160;  She did see the graphic signs as she was coming out of the Killing Mill.&#160;  She &amp; her friend the driver was screaming for me not to judge.&#160; I said  that we are suppose to judge righteously.&#160; "It's a choice" the one girl  &#160;replied &amp; I said that vanilla or chocolate ice cream is a choice not  abortion, for that's taking a human life, &amp; once you're pregnant you  give&#160;your baby a&#160;&#160;Birthday &amp; not a Death Day, for with every  abortion&#160;it is a sacrifice to Satan&#160;&amp; the abortionist has to make  out a Death Certificate.&#160; The baby gets a Death Certificate &amp; not a  Birth Certificate....that's just wrong!!!!!!&#160;&#160; At this point I realized that I was not getting anywhere with  them so I decided to walk back over to the fence.&#160; I heard the one girl, who was  the passenger, scream out "I had an abortion" &amp; the other girl was screaming  something to me too but I couldn't understand&#160;what she was saying,&#160;as they were  driving away.&#160; I thought so because they were so angry &amp; combative &amp;  wouldn't listen calmly to the Truth.&#160; It's not my Truth but&#160;God's Truth.&#160; People  don't like the Truth &amp; if they hear it they usually refuse it first if they  accept it at all.&#160; It's so very sad &amp; heart breaking too.&#160; I only can hope  &amp;&#160;pray that they both&#160;realize what they had done &amp; repent.&#160; </span></span></strong></div></div></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I went into the center around 6:30pm.&#160;

I cried for all the precious babies that were killed by the abortionist Rachael Phelps, at Planned Parenthood, today &amp; for all the mothers &amp; fathers &amp; grandmothers &amp; grandfathers, brothers &amp;

not think of my problems, so I got to work.&#160; The  doorbell started to ring right away &amp; I still had bags of food for our food  shelves, in my car.&#160; I was disappointed that Paul wasn't here to help us but a  few minutes later Karen came.&#160; I told her about the email scam &amp; she went  into the office &amp; went to work to try to solve the problem, which she did  through the grace of God!!&#160; I got all 522 of my email list back into the proper  place, yeah!!&#160;

all of a&#160;sudden a young  girl was walking in.&#160; I greeted her &amp; she did look familiar &amp; she was  telling me that she was pregnant &amp; wanted to share with me this great news.&#160;  Okay.&#160; Then she&#160; shocked me when she said that she had just come from Planned  Parenthood with the ultrasound picture of her precious baby.&#160; "What!"!&#160; I said,  you're lucky that you &amp; your baby made it out of there alive.&#160; She did say  that the woman didn't want to do the ultrasound &amp; after she did she  suggested an abortion.&#160; Oh my Lord!!&#160; I asked her why she didn't come to us  &amp; she said that she didn't know that we offered ultrasounds.&#160; I said "yes,  we do offer referrals for&#160;an ultrasounds".&#160; She gave me&#160;a&#160;paper of abortionist  that they gave her, so I looked at it &amp; I found out who they refer for  abortions.&#160; How evil is that??&#160; She said that she would never go back in there  again, for the lady wasn't nice, &amp;&#160;the place&#160;gave her the creeps.&#160; Karen  brought her into the Rose/Counseling Room to fill out an Intake Sheet so  that&#160;Suzanne can check up on her to see how she's doing.&#160; When she left the room  she went into the Material Aid Room to get some things for her daughter at  home.&#160; I gave her some literature &amp; a DVD on growth &amp; development &amp;  a gold pin of a 10 week old baby's feet. &#160;I pinned it on her jacket, that Martha  gave her from the clothes rack in the hallway, for she was cold &amp; I thought  that she was going to cry.&#160; I wished her well &amp; gave her a hug &amp; told  her to come back when she could.&#160; She said "thank you Miss Mary" &amp; went out  to catch her ride that was waiting for her.&#160; My heart was delighted.&#160; This  client came into our center last summer where we ministered to her for her many  conflicts &amp; it was great to see her again.&#160; I was so happy that she was  happy in being pregnant &amp; had no thought of having her precious baby be  hatched to death at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I wish that she &amp; all our clients  were married but we need to take them right where they are to transform them  &amp; to lead them to Christ who will convict them to do the right thing, in  their lives. </span></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br /></font></strong></div><div><strong>&#160;</strong></div><div><div>&#160;</div><strong><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The doorbell rang &amp; it was two young girls that have taken  us to the cleaners, in the Material Aid Room, in the past.&#160; I went with Martha  to confront them at the door.&#160; I make it clear that they get one bag each &amp;  no more &amp; to get only what they need &amp; not what they wanted.&#160; She did  end up getting the jewelry box never the less.&#160; I don't want one or two girls to  ruin it for the rest of the girls that come into the center, for I will not let  that happen.&#160; Karen was nice enough to take my keys &amp; to go out to my car  &amp; bring in all the bags filled with food for the Food Shelves.&#160; I appreciate  that Karen &amp; thank you!&#160; Martha &amp; I put the food onto the shelves.&#160; It  was now about 3pm &amp; Karen had to leave.&#160; Tomorrow will be her first class on  instruction of how to run the ultrasound machine at the other pregnancy center  in the city.&#160; After the all the classes, she will run the ultrasound machine,  that we will refer to at Embracing Options Pregnancy Center,&#160;Medical Center.&#160;

then she asked for a pregnancy test.&#160; I asked Martha if she  would assist for I was busy in the office.&#160;&#160; She agreed to do it.&#160; After about  10 minutes I emerged from my office &amp; asked if she was still her at the  center.&#160; Martha told me that she had taken a pregnancy test with her in the  bathroom to do her test &amp; when she can out she told Martha saying "see it  was negative".&#160; Martha told her that this was not our policy &amp; it wasn't how  we do things at Focus.&#160; She then confronted her like a mother.&#160; She left but she  should have consequences&#160;for her bad behavior today.&#160; She will be restricted in  coming into&#160; Focus for awhile &amp; hopeful an apology too.&#160; We are not here to  be taken for granted but to learn life's lessons.&#160;&#160;</span></strong></div><div><strong>&#160;</strong></div><div><div>&#160;</div><strong><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then doorbell rang &amp;

I was glad to hear this.&#160; She told  Martha &amp; I that she was headed to Las Vegas to visit some relatives but she  will be back for our next Mass on May 9th. at the center.&#160; I&#160;said&#160;"good bye"  &amp; went into the Great Room to lie down on the sofa for about 10 minutes.&#160; I  got up &amp; went to find Martha who was in the office starting to make up Truth  packets.&#160; I asked her if she would wait on them &amp; help me to finish emptying  the bags in the Great Room,&#160;to put into the Material Aid Room.&#160; She agreed.&#160; We  finally got done &amp; it looked great in the Great Room with no more plastic  garbage bags in it.&#160;

Mickey at out last Mass at Focus with the exorcism  prayer attached.&#160; I went around Planned Parenthood &amp; across the street to  sprinkle the Holy Water on the sidewalk, to protect us from&#160;demonic spirits.&#160;  When the rain started to fall I thought that the Holy Water would travel to more  places thus exorcising the demonic spirits away from us.&#160; We do not fight against  flesh &amp; blood but the powers of darkness.&#160; Later on I was glad that I had  sprinkled the Holy Water onto the ground.&#160; </span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;<strong>&#160;&#160; <br /></strong></span></div></div></div></strong></div></span><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><div><strong></strong></div></span> </span></div></span><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span> </span></div></div></span><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span> <strong></strong></span><strong><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&#160;</span> </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">A young girl was walking up the sidewalk  &amp; I told her that we could help her if she was going into Planned  Parenthood.&#160; She said that she wasn't going for an abortion but for birth  control.&#160; I told her that it sometimes causes an early abortion.&#160; She then said  "I'm to young to have a baby".&#160; Then I said back to her "then don't have sex if  you're not married".&#160; "What, are you crazy"! she replied then she hurried into  Planned Parenthood.&#160; When she came out, about 2 hours later, she was walking  pass Martha who was now on the brick side of Planned Parenthood, so I called  over to her to tell her once again to wait until marriage&#160;for sex.&#160; &#160;I&#160;saw that  Martha was also talking to her too.&#160; I hope that it resonated, in her mind &amp;  heart today, what she was told.&#160;&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: large;">Martha was on the brick side of the  building &amp; Dan &amp; Addison had arrived to pray the Rosary across the  street.&#160; Dan came over&#160;across the street&#160;to hand me some money for the center  which he does about twice a month.&#160; We are grateful to him &amp; to all who help  us out financially &amp; prayerfully, at Focus.</span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-size: large;">A police car had stopped along side to  where I was standing &amp; I saw that it was Officer Chris.&#160; I said "hi Officer  Chris, how are you today"?&#160; He&#160;said that he was fine &amp; then he asked me why  was the orange cones on the sidewalk lined up&#160;by the curb.&#160; I said&#160;"so that the  cars can see us so that they don't jump the curb &amp; take our legs off or  worse".&#160; He then replied "oh ya I'd have to do a lot of paper work then".&#160;&#160;Then  he&#160;added "I wouldn't want anything to happen to you or anyone else who's out  here on the sidewalk".&#160; I said "I know Officer Chris".&#160; Then we said good bye to  each other &amp; he left smiling &amp; so was I.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br /></span><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I saw that a young man had come out of Planned  Parenthood &amp; was standing on the sidewalk where we were.&#160; He was looking  around &amp; had ear phones in both ears.&#160; I didn't care so I took a chance  &amp; started talking to him hoping that he would be able to heart me.&#160; He did.&#160;  He took the ear phones out of his ears as I was asking him to save the baby that  was about to be killed.&#160; He said "I don't want her to do it &amp; I was trying  to talk her out of it but she&#160;isn't listening to me".&#160; I asked if the baby was  his &amp; he said that it wasn't &amp; that he had his own children &amp; was  good.&#160; I then said to him that it didn't matter if the baby was his or not just  go back in there to try to save this child &amp; tell her that there's people  out her that can help her.&#160; He said&#160;"okay" &amp; then went back into Planned  Parenthood to try again.&#160; Lord be with him.&#160; He came out about an hour or so  later &amp; was alone.&#160; I called over to him to go home now &amp; not to be  involved with her anymore.&#160; He got into his car &amp; drove out.&#160; I called to  him asking him if she had changed her mind &amp; he said "no, she went through  with it".

Martha was now on the same side of the  sidewalk with me.&#160; We both called out to the people coming into the abortion  mill pleading with them not to kill their child.&#160; A mother &amp; daughter drove  in with an expensive red car &amp; stayed in there for over two hours.&#160; They  sacrificed their child for a car!!&#160; What's wrong with people.&#160; When they came  out they didn't look to happy &amp; how could they, for they had a baby  slaughtered here today.&#160;How sick &amp; evil is that!!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I was by the fence when I heard someone from the  business right next door saying "Mary".&#160; I thought that they were going to tell  me that we couldn't stand there anymore for we are on their property by the  fence where we call out to the people going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; But thank  God that wasn't the case.&#160; I turned around to see a nice looking young man  handing me some baby bottles saying :maybe you can use these".&#160; I put my hand  thorough the fence &amp; took the bottles saying "yes we can use them &amp;  thank you so very much".&#160; As he was leaving I gave him eye contact for I  couldn't believe that this just happened with someone at Buckpitt, our nemesis  (unconquerable opponent)&#160;for about 11  years now.&#160; Things can change, Alleluia!!&#160; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I had to go into the center for a few minutes to  get something so when I was there I said "hi" to Suzanne &amp; asked if all was  well which it was.&#160; As I was about to leave the doorbell rang &amp; Paul  answered it.&#160; As I was coming up the hallway to go back outside the two girls  that were just let in were walking down the hallway.&#160; I asked what can do for  them &amp; the one girl whispered that she wanted a pregnancy test.&#160; I called  Suzanne, for she was in the office, &amp; when she came out into the hall I said  that these two girls needed her assistance.&#160; She greeted them &amp; asked what  could she do for them &amp; the one girl&#160;again replied that she needed a  pregnancy test so Suzanne lead them into the Counseling Room as I was now out  the door.&#160; It was about 30 minutes later that the two came out on the front  lines where Martha recognized the girls as coming into Focus last week where she  assisted them with a pregnancy test, it was negative but she told her to come  back a week later for a retest, which she did.&#160; She smiled at the girls &amp;  they asked if they each could hold a sign.&#160; I said "sure just go over there to  pick one out".&#160; The one girl was now holding a big picture of the Divine Mercy  picture of the Sacred Heart&#160;of Jesus &amp; the other girl was holding a graphic  sign.&#160; All was well for about 10 minuets in the rain witnessing to the cars  driving by.&#160; There goes the city bus again for the third time honking as it went  by us.&#160; The one girl said "there goes our bus driver, she&#160;agrees&#160;in&#160;what you're  doing out here".&#160; "That's great", I said back to her.&#160; It was nice getting  positive support from the community, for a change.&#160; Then things changed real  fast &amp; not for the good either.&#160; A car parked across the street &amp; a man  with long hair &amp; a beard got out &amp; started to cross the street towards  where we ladies were standing screaming not so nice things at us.&#160; Then Adolf  came from across the street &amp; joined us &amp; Paul who was leaving to go  home saw that we were having difficulties &amp; joined us.&#160; He was so full of  rage that he didn't even see me cross the street to get his license number.&#160;  When he saw that I was near his car he went crazy.&#160; I faked calling the police  thinking that he would get into his car &amp; drive away but he didn't.&#160; I  needed to protect the team as he continued to rant &amp; rave some more so I  decided to really call the police this time.&#160; I was shaking because he was near  me on the other side of the street where the team was on the other side.&#160; I  called 911 &amp; told the operator what was going on &amp; the description of  the man.&#160; After the call I walked over to where the others where.&#160; I got a call  from the 911 operator asking if I had separated myself from him &amp; I said  that I had.&#160; Then the man went in the middle of the street screaming.&#160; I wanted  the police to come in a hurry.&#160; The cars were driving slowly so as not to hit  him.&#160; It was horrible.&#160; Then he went back to his car &amp; I thought that maybe  he was going to get out a rifle but instead he got out a big piece of paper.&#160;  Who carry's around with them a big piece of paper in their car &amp; wrote on  it.&#160; Then he showed us the paper as he was screaming thing I won't repeat.&#160; Then  Martha said "are you Jewish", to which he replied "yes I am".&#160; I was told  afterwards that he wrote on the piece of paper 'I AM A JEW'.&#160; He ranted &amp;  raved about that.&#160; It was so sad to see a grown man go crazy.&#160; I dropped my  umbrella a couple of times due to the wind &amp; he said "you can't even ho;d on  to the umbrella".&#160; He was so abusive &amp; has many psychotic problems to which  treatment is a necessity.&#160; I looked over to Buckpitt &amp; saw that the two men  that work there were grinning.&#160; Oh yea you're real men that protect  women.....not.&#160; You are weasels.&#160; Real men protect women &amp; you're not.&#160; Paul  sated that this man was demonic I agreed.&#160; He stayed with us &amp; Adolf was now  on our side of the sidewalk protecting us too.&#160; They all knew that I had called  the police so we were just waiting.&#160; He went back into the middle of the road  again &amp; when he almost got hit I said to him "you almost got hit be  careful".&#160; He answered back to me "oh you care".&#160; I said "of course I care I  want to save lives".&#160; Then the police came.&#160; The officer saw him in the middle  of the road &amp; he pulled his vehicle on the side where he was.&#160; I called over  to the officer &amp; said that we called the police first for after I called the  police on him, for real, he called the police on me because I was near his car  &amp; was taking down his license number.&#160; For real??&#160; I walked back over to the  other side of the street to where the police was &amp; the man that was acting  crazy &amp; told him what he had done.&#160; Then I went back over to be with the  team as he talked to the police.&#160; Martha then remembered that this man came up  to her when she was alone on the sidewalk about 8 months ago &amp; acted very  strange &amp; spit on the ground near to where she was standing.&#160; She said that  he finally left.&#160; I asked her to tell the officer, so&#160;when she said "yes" she  would, I called over to the officer that we still had to speak to him one more  time.&#160; He finally came over &amp; Martha told him what had happened months ago.&#160;  The officer said that he felt passionate about his side as we feel passionate  about our side.&#160; I know that we're for saving lives do you mean to tell me that  he feels passionate about taking lives??&#160; He also said&#160; that if he wanted to  stand across the street &amp; just stare at us, he could, as long as he didn't  threaten us.&#160; Oh no officer just making us feel very uneasy is certainly all  right.&#160; Freedom of Speech &amp; Expression is good for all.&#160; I understand, for  this is America&gt;&gt;&#160; Finally after the poor man talked hi ear off he finally  left &amp; so did the officer after he took my name &amp; address &amp; phone  number down as he did the man with the long hair &amp; beard because he called  the police too.&#160; Really, I would say that he should be penalized for making a  bogus 911 call about nothing.&#160; I thought that at one time this was a no no, now  it's okay to bother the 911 operators about nothing.&#160; Boy have things changed.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">After the man &amp; the police left Paul &amp; the  girls helped to take things into the center.&#160; I helped too.&#160; When I got into the  center Martha &amp; I talked to the girls to see if they were all right.&#160; They  said that they were a little scared but not to much.&#160; Then I told then if they  wanted to help us out that being in Focus &amp; working in there would be the  best bet &amp; not on the front lines.&#160; They needed hours for their class  project so they'll be back on Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays from 4pm until 6pm to  help us out....that sounds like a plan girls.&#160; After Martha feed them with  chocolate cake &amp; a big glass of milk we put them to work packing diapers in  a plastic bag for our mothers.&#160; They like to do that until their ride came to  pick them up.&#160; See you next Tuesday girls.&#160; I wonder what their mothers will say  when they tell them what happened today.&#160;
