that maybe they weren't doing abortions today because of the Operation  Save America group was in Rochester.&#160; Wortman the abortionist in Brighton was  closed.&#160; Later on I saw a young girl struggle to get into the car that an older  woman was driving.&#160; The young girl&#160;slumped down in the front seat, which is so  typical of having an abortion.&#160; I was now not sure if they were doing abortions  or not.&#160; This was&#160;a sad sight to behold.&#160;

an emotional mess because the  day was so intense as I entered the pregnancy center.&#160; There were two mothers  &amp;&#160;I thought only one two year old&#160;little girl know in the center.&#160; The  little girl was eating potato chips that the mom must have given her....not my  choice of food for a two year old :(&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mom was on the phone using not so  nice language &amp; her friend said to her to use nice language.&#160; Martha &amp; I  agreed.&#160; The little girl saw a package of chocolate chip coolies on the counter  of our kitchenette &amp; started to reach for them.&#160; I bought them for the  Operation Save America people as they protested&#160; Planned Parenthood.&#160; Martha  told me to give her one &amp; I did.&#160; She was still hungry so we gave her  cheese, a better choice.&#160; I walked to the first Material Aid Room &amp; I saw  that there was a baby carriage in there so I walked over to it to see that there  was a baby in there.&#160; I walked to the Green Room where there was only one mother  &amp; asked if this baby was hers &amp; she said "yes".&#160; I went back to the room  &amp; brought her baby &amp; told her that she should be with her infant &amp;  not alone in a room.&#160; Prayer &amp; education &amp; love are the answers&#160;for our  moms.&#160; The little girl started to cry loudly &amp; wanted everything &amp; she  was difficult to handle for Martha &amp; I, for the mother was just sitting  there at the table doing nothing.&#160; She called for a ride home &amp; as she was  getting into the car Martha heard her say to the driver "I wish that I could put  my daughter up for adoption".&#160; She should have done that two years ago.....poor  child.&#160; She needed food &amp; a nap &amp; lots of love.&#160; As she was leaving I  gave her our flier for our class on the last Wednesday of August taught by  Natalie &amp; Fay from the J.U.S.T<font size="2"><font face="Arial">.</font></font>M.E group<font size="2"><font face="Arial"> </font><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">at:</span></span></font><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></font>http://justmecenter.org/about-us</span>.&#160;

Another clinic, Wortman's in Brighton, that they were supposed to  be in front of today was closed, so they also came to our site and we  had double the people! They were surrounded! People were down the block  near Scio St. also. There was a guitar and drums and everyone was singing  praise and worship songs. It must've freaked them out. Then the  Rochester organizer (<font face="Arial">Mike</font>) was in the back with LOUD speakers and I  do mean LOUD, playing music and preaching. I'm sure it disturbed them  inside the building. He had a permit so there was nothing they could do.  Many Federal Marshalls and official looking people in undercover cars  came. They had a pow-wow in the parking lot, but nothing came of it. If  it was like this every day, I'd pitch a tent on University Ave. I also  wish our people would come out on Thursdays like they did this week.  Maybe now they will.</font></strong>&#160;</div></span></div></div></font></div><p><font face="Arial"> </font></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;<br /><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font></p><div style="text-align: center;"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span id="TitleLabel" style="font-weight: bold;">'Mary, Pray For Us'</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><font size="3"> <br /><br /><strong><span id="SPAN2" style="font-size: 16px;"><span id="TextLabel" style="font-size: 16px;">May Mother Mary embrace you with her motherly love and grant you  many graces as well.

I then greeted Chris &amp; Dick &amp; went into the  center.&#160; Paul was with me &amp; Ney came in about 30 minutes later, thank God.&#160;  It was another very busy Tuesday &amp; I was grateful that I had help.&#160; Anne  came in looking very tired &amp; she said that being out on the sidewalk  counseling is very hard.&#160; I agreed.&#160; She wanted to go back out for a little  while again &amp; she took two Truth packets with her.&#160; She came back into Focus  about 20 minutes later &amp; she gave away the two packets &amp; talked with  some women.&#160; Great job Anne!&#160; We sat down to talk about many things.&#160; Her  daughter will be getting married in Rochester in September so I will see her  &amp; her family again soon.&#160; I'm thrilled.&#160; Anne is so kind &amp; caring &amp;  generous &amp; I thank God for our long friendship.&#160; I worked for her husband  for almost 10 years before the company closed.&#160; Just before she left Pat came to  Focus along with a tall strong man who is her relative escorting her.&#160; She has  lost weight &amp; looks not as good as when I saw her last.&#160; She had a silent  heart attack about a month or so ago.&#160; She's on lots of medications &amp;  refuses surgery.&#160; Can't talk to Pat, I just have to listen.&#160; I do try to plant  seeds, for she's so angry, which isn't good for soul or body.&#160; Pat is Pat &amp;  only God can change her along with her saying "yes" to Him.&#160; She loves God just  not some of His people.&#160; She just saw the doctor &amp; wanted to come to say  "hi" to us.&#160; Anne was happy to see her after so many years.&#160; Anne gave Pat some  money to buy what she needed for her family.&#160; Anne had left &amp; I visited with  Pat for some time as Ney was whizzing passed me looking&#160; very busy.&#160; I knew that  she understood.&#160; When Pat left she &amp; her relative walked over to  Assemblyman's David Gantt's office for she wanted to speak with him.&#160; He wasn't  in but was let in by one of his staff.&#160; I said "goodbye" &amp;

all were negative.&#160; I went out  into the hall to see a familiar face of one of our clients that I haven't seen  in awhile.&#160; She introduced me to her sister &amp; we went into the Rose Room for  the test.&#160; The young lady said that her daughter that we helped her with was now  5 years old &amp; is very smart.&#160; She said that when she was 17 years old &amp;  was pregnant everyone said for her to have an abortion even a man from a  Catholic Church that she walked into one day,&#160;when she took off, from school.&#160;  He said "if you do it before 60 days they'll be no problem".&#160; She said "thank  God that I didn't listen to him or anyone else that wanted me to have an  abortion".&#160; She came to Focus &amp; we helped her &amp; she was glad of that.&#160; I  asked if she knew the man's name &amp; she said "no, I never went back there  again".&#160; I felt so badly that he said that to her for that is not what the  Catholic Church teaches.....abortion is ALWAYS EVIL.&#160; Lord have Mercy on him  &amp; I hope that he learned the truth &amp; has gone to the Sacrament of  Confession to confess his sin.&#160; This young girl was so right in continuing her  pregnancy &amp; she knows it too.&#160; The conversation went o her sister who is 17  years old &amp; is on birth control.&#160; She had the rod of hormones planted in her  upper arm &amp; is complaining of headaches.&#160; I went over to the shelf to get  the brochure about the drug she's taking &amp; read the Side Effects to her.&#160;  The first one was headaches to which she replied that she has many of them.&#160; The  list went on &amp; on &amp; at the end of the list she said that she will be  getting this out of her arm as soon as possible.&#160; I said "yes" &amp; "no sex  until you're marred".&#160; They were both good girls seeking the Truth.&#160; The  pregnancy test was negative but she might have come in to early, so she will  come back if she needs to, for a repeat test in two weeks.&#160; Okay girls now go  &amp; be happy in Chastity.&#160;

&#160;On the sidewalk ministry, in front of Planned Parenthood, a car  was leaving the parking lot &amp; I offered our truth package, which has much  information in it, to the two ladies in the car.&#160; The car stopped in the street  &amp; when I went over to the car I saw that the passenger had a white wrist  bracelet on, which means an abortion. I quickly asked her if she had an abortion  &amp; she said that she was going to but changed her mind.&#160; She took the package  of brochures &amp; I told her where the Focus Pregnancy Center was down the  street.&#160; Her precious baby was saved from being killed by abortion &amp; now she  received the truth.

When I  was&#160;at&#160;home&#160;I received a call from Paul saying that he had good news for me.&#160;  "Okay Paul what is it"?&#160; First, he said that we were going to get the key, from  the landlord Dan, that we will be used for the dump<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">s<font size="3">ter out side</font>.</span>&#160; "Great Paul" I said.&#160;  "What else"?.&#160; He said that there was a leakage of a substance on the sidewalk  in front of Planned Parenthood &amp; the<font size="3"><font face="Arial"> </font></font><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font size="3">street</font> w<font size="3">as</font></span> blocked off by <font size="3"><font face="Arial">f</font></font>ire engines.&#160;  "What, that's great", I said.&#160; Then he said that the street blocked off <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><font size="3">so</font></span> no one could get through &amp; Sheila &amp; her brother Dennis went home,  for the police asked them to leave the sidewalk.&#160; I said "thanks Paul &amp; I'll  be coming&#160;soon &amp; see if I can get through some how".&#160; I trusted in the Lord  that I could get into Focus.&#160; I finished getting ready &amp; then went to the  bank for Focus &amp; then to McDonald's for a chicken wrap &amp; then went to  Focus.&#160; When I got to University Ave. the parking lot to Focus was blocked off, so I parked on the street &amp; put in my 7 quarters in the meter &amp; walked  over to the parking lot where everyone was standing.&#160; I saw Paul, who was on the  other side of the yellow tape, &amp; Martha &amp; Rob, Dan, Addison &amp; Jim,  who were on the sidewalk behind the tape.&#160; Adolf &amp; Kathryn had left to go  back home.&#160;The policeman who was standing there said that if we were to go into  the center&#160;we couldn't come back out until the all the trucks were gone.&#160; I said  "okay officer". &#160;I then saw that I could go down Gibbs St.&#160;to park in the back  of the building.&#160;&#160;So I went back to&#160;my car &amp; drove to the parking lot&#160;in the  back of Focus.&#160;&#160;I knew&#160;that we could get into the center through the back  entrance, so&#160;I pounded on the back door &amp; Paul answered.&#160;&#160;Rob &amp; I&#160;went  in &amp; got the literature box, mega phone &amp; graphic signs &amp; walked to  the back of Planned Parenthood with everyone but Martha, for she stayed in the  center with Paul.&#160;&#160;Planned Parenthood&#160;recently opened up the back fence to let  the people come &amp; go from the mill.&#160; When we arrived I saw that there were  two women standing by the open fence wearing Blue Aprons that said 'Planned  Parenthood'.&#160; The Death Escorts were in place.&#160; It made my stomach hurt to see  these women there helping to kill &amp; misguide so many women &amp; men.&#160; Then  Rick Bartell came out &amp; put on a blue&#160;apron too.&#160; I said to him "nothing  changes around here, you people are all the same".&#160; I called out to the people  going in &amp; coming out of this miserable place.&#160; There was a car with a young  man &amp; woman in it &amp; I called out to them.&#160; They came out about 5 minutes  later &amp; I said to then "please don't come back here to kill".&#160; This baby has  a chance of life, thank God.&#160; I don't think that this afternoon they were doing  abortions but in the morning, before the liquid spill, they did kill precious  babies,&#160;for some men were waiting for the girls that they had brought in here,  to have their baby killed, were waiting for them to recover &amp; leave.&#160; We  spoke to them too.&#160; I tried to call Kathryn &amp; I left a message on her voice  mail but later on I received a call from the person that I left a message saying  that I got the wrong number..sorry sir :(</strong></span></span></font></font></div><p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"> </font></font></p><div align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Then I turned around &amp; saw that  Lynda was walking down the sidewalk with a very tall young man.&#160; She introduced  Sebastian to us all.&#160; He was a very nice man who is pro life...yeah!!!&#160; We spoke  to each other &amp; he spoke to the people using the mega phone.&#160; He was a  blessing to all of us out on the front lines.&#160; I then walked to the front of the  strip mall &amp; saw that the fire trucks &amp; police cars were leaving it was  now around 3:15pm.&#160; I went back to the other side &amp; told everyone to move to  the front of the Killing Mill &amp; we did.&#160; Martha came outside now to join  us.&#160; A couple of girls were walking into Planned Parenthood &amp; I spoke with  them &amp; they went in only to come back outside about 10 minutes later.&#160; I  again spoke to them &amp; then lead them into Focus.&#160; As we were walking into  the center the one girl asked if we do pregnancy tests &amp; I said "yes we  do".&#160; I lead them into the center &amp; directed them into the Rose Room.&#160; I  went into the office to tell Suzanne that there was a pregnancy test to do &amp;  she said that she had to leave now.&#160; I then went back into the Rose Room &amp;  the client administered the test which was negative.&#160; I spoke with the two girls  for about 15 minutes trying to help change their lives.&#160; Then I went back  outside to re join the team.&#160; Rob,&#160;Dan, Jim &amp; Addison had to leave &amp; at  4pm Lynda &amp; Sebastian had to go too.&#160; It was a pleasure meeting him &amp;  thank you Lynda for bringing him to the front lines today.&#160; The best to always  dear man of God.&#160; Martha &amp; I stayed out for a short time &amp; then went  back into Focus to do our work in there.&#160; We had a mother who's due date is next  month come in to get new things for her baby...she was happy.&#160; It was about 6pm  when the doorbell ran &amp; it was Natalie, our once a month volunteer, to talk  about the Workshop on August 28th. at Focus.&#160; She has all things planned &amp;  I'm at peace with all that is doing.&#160; Now we pray that some&#160;girls will show up  to get the knowledge that they need in this cruel &amp; deceptive world.&#160; What a  day!!!!</strong></span></span></font></font></div><p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"> </font></font></p><div align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></span></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"> </font></font>&#160;<strong> </strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font size="3"><font face="Arial">C</font></font>heck out:</span></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></span></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"> </font></font><strong><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"> </font></font></strong><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="3"><div><strong>&#160;</strong></div><div><strong>&#160;</strong></div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.whec.com/news/stories/S3130230.shtml?cat=565"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">http://www.whec.com/news/stories/S3130230.shtml?cat=565</span></span></span></a></font></strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;<div>&#160;<strong> </strong><br /><strong> </strong><div>&#160;</div></div></div></span></div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><strong><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.13wham.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/hazmat-team-called-home-university-avenue-2902.shtml"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">http://www.13wham.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/hazmat-team-called-home-university-avenue-2902.shtml</span></span></span></a></font></span></div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div>&#160;</div></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><div><strong>&#160;&#160;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#160;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></div></span></span><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span> </strong></span><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div><div><strong><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://rochester.ynn.com/content/all_news/rochester/681263/hazmat-situation-on-university-avenue-cleared/"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">http://rochester.ynn.com/content/all_news/rochester/681263/hazmat-situation-on-university-avenue-cleared</span></span></span></a></font></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><div>&#160;</div><hr /><div>&#160;&#160;

some regarding Adoption too.&#160; I then showed her  the two Material Aid Rooms. &#160;She had filled out an Intake Sheet earlier &amp; we  will be calling her to see how she is doing soon.&#160; I said we are hear for you  &amp;

Martha had to go to a Wake, for her friend died  last week.&#160; I was sorry that I couldn't go with her to give her support.&#160; I was  now finished with my work so I went into the room to hear the testimonies of two  women.&#160; Elizabeth&#160;had&#160;arrived &amp; we went into the Great Room together.&#160;&#160;The  testimonies of these two women were fantastic &amp; I felt that the Lord wanted  me to give my testimony, for the first time in a large group, for there were  nine women &amp; their good children in the room.&#160; I was impressed &amp;  inspired by the two women &amp; how God helped them in their lives.&#160; I wanted to  give God the Glory too for what He has done in my life.&#160; I walked up to the  podium &amp; I asked Natalie if I could give my testimony &amp; she said&#160;"yes",  so I did.&#160; It flowed smoothly but as I was speaking I thought, 'did all these  things happen to me'.&#160;

a women came up tome &amp; said  that she had an abortion 23 years ago &amp; it still bothers her.&#160; I brought her  into the Rose Room &amp; talked with her for about 10 minutes.&#160; I gave her two  phone numbers to women to talk with for healing.&#160; Then I went over to the  material rack &amp; gave her many brochures to help her.&#160; She said that she has  five children &amp; had her Tubes tied.&#160; I told her that was wrong &amp; asked  her to ask God to forgive her &amp; gave her another brochure about Tubule  Libation.&#160; I said that you needed to trust in God, who you believe in, &amp; you  weren't suppose to do things like that to&#160;your body.&#160; She was receptive to the  Truth that I was speaking.&#160; She had asked the Lord to forgive her for the  abortion.&#160; I was happy to hear this.&#160; Catholics go to Confession &amp;  Protestants don't have that Sacrament, so they have to ask God with a sincere  heart to&#160;forgive them, for their serious sins.&#160; She told me that she was 15  years old when she had the abortion &amp; she asked her Aunt to drive her  there.&#160; She didn't tell her Aunt that she was taking her for an abortion &amp;  had to ask her years later to forgive her for what she did.&#160;

I picked up the mega phone &amp; said "please take off the Cross  until you become a Christian.&#160; Then someone said :he's walking over here".&#160; I  went to the sidewalk, from being near the fence, &amp; then I saw this man come  towards me all 5ft. 4inches of him, with his finger wiggling up &amp; down.&#160; He  said "what did you say to me"?&#160; I said "take off the Cross until you become a  Christian" &amp; please put your finger down, for that's not how you treat  women".&#160; He said "I'm calling the police for harassment".&#160; I said "don't waste  their time &amp; it's not harassment, don't you know what harassment means".&#160; I  interjected that we knew the police &amp; they are nice.&#160;Martha started to talk  with him saying that he should thank his mother for life.&#160; He said that he gets  along&#160;with his&#160;mother &amp; then he said that he was Pro Choice.&#160; I said,  "Martha don't talk to him anymore, for we'll&#160;get him for harassment". &#160;I wanted  him to go.&#160; Mary Lou &amp; Colleen said "go, get out of here".&#160; You go  girls....team work!!!&#160; He finally left.&#160; Then I saw that Rick Bartell, from  Planned Parenthood, was now talking to him.&#160; I hollered over there saying "Rick  Bartell".&#160; Then I saw that he was waving at me.&#160; No sense at all.&#160; I then said  to him that we were praying, for him,&#160;to St. John Fisher for his conversion.&#160;He  graduated from the college with this saints name. &#160;I then went on calling out to  the people going in &amp; out of the Killing Mill, trying to save&#160; babies  lives.&#160; A car stopped &amp; said "thank you for what you're doing out here, keep  it up, I thought you should know".&#160; I said "thank you for stopping by to tell me  that".&#160; It's all worth it trying to save &amp; change lives, for the Lord,&#160;I  just wish this wasn't happening out here.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Mary Lou &amp; Colleen &amp; I went back into the center &amp; talked&#160;about  what we needed as a pregnancy center &amp; how they could help us get what we  needed.&#160; We also talked about the dynamics of the front lines.&#160; We were in the  center for about 30 minutes when Martha &amp; Lynda came in with the sidewalk  equipment.&#160; They joined us with the conversation.&#160;Because of this meeting, the  next day, I asked Lynda if she would be on our Board, she said that she would  come to the meeting on September 17th. &amp; she'll bring Bill, her husband.&#160;  Sounds like a great plan.&#160; She said that she would come next week on Wednesday  &amp; Thursday, on the front lines,&#160;great news again :)&#160; &#160;A very busy  day!!!!&#160;</span></span></div><div>&#160;</div><div><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#160;&#160; </span></span></div></font></strong></div><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="profilePic img" src="https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/c55.99.350.350/s160x160/22056_1219029873652_7791632_n.jpg" alt="Rachael Phelps" />&#160;</p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"> ABORTIONIST RACHEL PHELPS AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD</span></strong></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">114 UNIVERSITY AVE.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><strong>PLESAE PRAY FOR HER TO STOP KILLING CHILDREN</strong></span></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>https://www.facebook.com/rachael.phelps.169&#160;</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;&#160;<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> </span></p><div align="center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" id="TitleLabel">'Have Courage</span></span><strong><span style="font-size: large;"><font size="3">'</font></span></strong></span><font size="2"><font size="3"><br /></font></font></div><div align="center"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">&#160;</span></div><p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"> <strong> </strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><div align="center">&#160;</div></strong></span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong><div align="center"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><font size="2"><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 16px;" id="SPAN2"><span style="font-size: 16px;" id="TextLabel">It   took courage to be Christ.

I replied "if someone was going to kill them I would be there to save  them too".&#160; How&#160;intense is that??&#160; He agreed.&#160; He said that some of the  businesses have been effected.&#160; I said that they were still in business.&#160; I  mentioned that the Federal Government told us where to stand so is isn't our  fault where we ended up on the sidewalk.&#160; The business next store to Planned  Parenthood, hasn't been kind to us over the many years.&#160; He seemed to understand  more about our pro life team of wonderful people.&#160; He smiled at me &amp; we  shook hands &amp; he left.&#160; I hope that he's fair about us out here on the front  lines for his article in the City Newspaper.</strong></span></div><div>&#160;</div></span></font></strong></div><p><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br /></strong></span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">&#160;Please go to Front Line Weekly # 21.&#160;
