Headlines include:</center><center><br />
Planned Parenthood failed to report incest Planned Parenthood didn't tell, suit says Planned Parenthood concealing crimes? Even the Wednesday STOPP Report has included items about this scandal in the past couple of issues.</center><center>We decided to devote the entire issue of this week’s Wednesday STOPP Report to bring you breaking information on this important subject.</center><center>A history of Planned Parenthood’s illegal activity</center><center>There is no way of telling definitively how long Planned Parenthood has been protecting rapists. But here is just a sampling of the events pulled from American Life League’s archives:</center><center><br />
Arizona In 1998, a 12-year-old girl in Glendale, Arizona, who was raped by her foster brother, had an abortion at Planned Parenthood and PP never reported the rape to authorities. Finally, when the same girl went to Planned Parenthood six months later for another abortion, PP did notify authorities and the foster brother was arrested and convicted. The girl sued Planned Parenthood for failing to report the rape the first time and a judge ruled that PP was negligent for not initially reporting the rape. Court documents report the girl reached a settlement in the case.</center><center><br />
California In 1999, an 11-year-old girl in California went to Planned Parenthood of the Golden Gate. She told Planned Parenthood that she had been raped, but asked PP not to tell anyone, including her parents. Of course, the law is clear; regardless of the girl’s desires, when an 11-year-old is raped, there are mandatory reporting requirements. In December of 2005 Planned Parenthood of the Golden Gate featured a letter from the girl on its website. The girl wrote in praise of Planned Parenthood for helping her keep her rape secret. After American Life League exposed this letter and publicly denounced Planned Parenthood’s inaction the letter was immediately taken down. (However, the letter can still be found on the internet archive.)</center><center><br />
Ohio In November 2004 a 16-year-old-girl was brought to a Planned Parenthood abortion facility in Cincinnati and forced to have an abortion by her father. The girl says she told the Planned Parenthood employee that her father was forcing her to have sex. Planned Parenthood did not report the abuse and the father continued to rape the girl for another year and a half. On May 9, 2007 the girl filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio for refusing to report the rape. The same Planned Parenthood affiliate is also being sued for not reporting the rape of a 14-year-old girl by her soccer coach.</center><center><br />
Connecticut A 22-year-old man was arrested this month in New London, Connecticut for raping a 14-year-old girl and getting her pregnant three times in six months. Newspaper reports say it was the girl’s mother that alerted authorities, not the abortion facility. Although newspaper accounts do not identify the abortion facility involved, Mark Crutcher of Life Dynamics in Denton, Texas told the Wednesday STOPP Report that he has a copy of the police reports and it was a Planned Parenthood abortion facility in Norwich, Connecticut.</center><center>Life Dynamics’ important work</center><center>Mark Crutcher has been at the forefront in calling attention to the outrageous activities of Planned Parenthood in protecting those who prey on our children.</center><center>In 2002, he conducted an undercover investigation to determine how widespread the practice of Planned Parenthood protecting child predators is. He had a young woman, posing as a 13-year-old girl, call over 800 Planned Parenthood and National Abortion Federation facilities across the country, telling the clinic personnel that her 22-year-old boyfriend got her pregnant and asking how she could get an abortion without getting her boyfriend in trouble.</center><center>In all 50 states clinic workers are required by law to report known sexual activity between a 13-year-old and an adult, yet the Life Dynamics investigation found that 91 percent of the time, Planned Parenthood advised the girl on how to protect the child predator.</center><center>Planned Parenthood tries to intimidate young student reporter</center><center>As Lila Rose, a student at UCLA, heard about all these accusations against Planned Parenthood, she decided to conduct her own undercover investigation of Planned Parenthood in her community. On several occasions she visited various abortion clinics posing as a 15 year old who, she told clinic staff, was impregnated by her 23-year-old boyfriend. Her conversations with the staff were recorded by a video camera that she concealed in her bag.</center><center>Once again, Planned Parenthood staff tried to help her cover up what was described as a case of statutory rape. Under California law, PP was required to report her sexual activity if she was 15, but would not have to report it if she was 16. In one such recording, a Planned Parenthood employee can be heard instructing Rose to “say you are 16,” and then instructed her to lie on the forms: “Just figure out a birth date that works. And I don't know anything."</center><center>When Planned Parenthood was confronted in public with this taped violation of California law, its response was to attack Lila. Shortly after the videos and articles exposing Planned Parenthood became public Planned, Parenthood threatened legal action against her. According to California law it is illegal to record people unless all members being taped are aware of it. In compliance with the law, Rose has handed over the videos to Planned Parenthood and has removed them from the internet.</center><center>Incredibly, Planned Parenthood in California disregards the laws that protect minors, but insists on adherence to laws that protect Planned Parenthood. Obviously, its priorities are all messed up.</center><center>What can you do?</center><center>We believe that this entire subject will be key in the eventual destruction of Planned Parenthood. All of us who fight Planned Parenthood rightly emphasize the huge numbers of children it kills and the way it steals the souls of our teens. But its protection of child predators is something that surpasses both of the others in terms of encouraging people to oppose Planned Parenthood.</center><center>Just this week, American Life League’s Rock for Life Ventura chapter was outside a Planned Parenthood abortion facility in Los Angeles. The members report that even avidly pro-abortion individuals are upset with Planned Parenthood about its protection of child predators.</center><center>If we focus on this issue, we can hasten the demise of Planned Parenthood. Here are some of the things we encourage you to do:</center><center><br />
FOCUS – While maintaining all your ongoing efforts against Planned Parenthood, every organization fighting PP should identify one person who will focus on the child predator issue. KNOW – Get the background information on this whole effort at Child Predators and be prepared to answer questions. Your organization should also know the mandatory reporting laws in your state. Every state has them. RESEARCH – Find out about the Planned Parenthood facilities in your area. How many customers under the age of 15 does it claim to have? How many reports has it filed with the authorities about the sexual activities of these customers? If you need help getting this information, just send us an e-mail. Put “researcher” in the subject line and we will get you in touch with a professional researcher who has already helped a number of groups get this data. FUNDING – Find out if your local PP clinic gets funds from Title X or other government programs. All these programs require that PP adhere to all state mandatory reporting rules. If PP is not reporting, it will not only lose all future funds, but it will have to pay back past funds received. TAKE ACTION – Based on everything you find out, you should take action to bring Planned Parenthood to justice. Among the things you should do: Document your findings in a report that can be given out to interested people. Educate your local community through press releases, press conferences, letters to the editor and fliers. American Life League has a one-page flier that you can download. You can make copies and distribute them. You can even run the flier as an ad in your local newspapers (including the popular “shoppers” news). Ask your local district attorney, in light of the growing evidence around the country of Planned Parenthood’s involvement in protecting rapists, to launch an investigation of your local Planned Parenthood to ensure it is properly reporting. Ask the government agencies that are funding Planned Parenthood to conduct a thorough audit of your local Planned Parenthood to ensure it is complying with all mandatory reporting requirements. If your local Planned Parenthood clinic receives Title X funding (you can see the list of Title X recipients by state), ask your elected members of Congress to request the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct an audit. Inform parents in your area that, if they find out their under-age children are receiving contraceptives or abortions at Planned Parenthood, they may be able to file a report. Send them to Parental Alert. American Life League will be working closely with Life Dynamics on this effort and we encourage everyone who is serious about fighting Planned Parenthood to take action in your local communities.</center><center><br />

The man was not a Nazi or Klansman; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Sanger's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists. One, Lothrop Stoddard, was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy. Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as "scientific" and "humanitarian." And Dr. Harry Laughlin, another Sanger associate and board member for her group, spoke of purifying America's human "breeding stock" and purging America's "bad strains." These "strains" included the "shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South."</p><p>Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as "unfit," a plan she said would be the "salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were "irresponsible and reckless," among whom she included those " whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers." She further contended that "there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped." That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered "unfit" cannot be easily refuted.</p><p>While Planned Parenthood's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements, history definitively says otherwise. The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review, which Sanger founded in 1917. She published such articles as "Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics" (June 1920), "The Eugenic Conscience" (February 1921), "The purpose of Eugenics" (December 1924), "Birth Control and Positive Eugenics" (July 1925), "Birth Control: The True Eugenics" (August 1928), and many others.</p><p>These eugenic and racial origins are hardly what most people associate with the modern Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), which gave its Margaret Sanger award to the late Dr. Martin Luther King in 1966, and whose current president, Faye Wattleton, is black, a former nurse, and attractive.</p><p>Though once a social pariah group, routinely castigated by religious and government leaders, the PPFA is now an established, high-profile, well-funded organization with ample organizational and ideological support in high places of American society and government. Its statistics are accepted by major media and public health officials as "gospel"; its full-page ads appear in major newspapers; its spokespeople are called upon to give authoritative analyses of what America's family policies should be and to prescribe official answers that congressmen, state legislator and Supreme Court justiices all accept as "social orthodoxy."</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Blaming Families</font></p><p>Sanger's obsession with eugenics can be traced back to her own family. One of 11 children, she wrote in the autobiographical book, My Fight for Birth Control, that "I associated poverty, toil, unemployment, drunkenness, cruelty, quarreling, fighting, debts, jails with large families." Just as important was the impression in her childhood of an inferior family status, exacerbated by the iconoclastic, "free-thinking" views of her father, whose "anti-Catholic attitudes did not make for his popularity" in a predominantly Irish community.</p><p>The fact that the wealthy families in her hometown of Corning, N.Y., had relatively few children, Sanger took as prima facie evidence of the impoverishing effect of larger families. The personal impact of this belief was heightened 1899, at the age of 48. Sanger was convinced that the "ordeals of motherhood" had caused the death of her mother. The lingering consumption (tuberculosis) that took her mother's life visited Sanger at the birth of her own first child on Nov. 18, 1905. The diagnosis forced her to seek refuge in the Adirondacks to strengthen her for the impending birth. Despite the precautions, the birth of baby Grant was "agonizing," the mere memory of which Sanger described as "mental torture" more than 25 years later. She once described the experience as a factor "to be reckoned with" in her zealous campaign for birth control.</p><p>From the beginning, Sanger advocacy of sex education reflected her interest in population control and birth prevention among the "unfit." Her first handbook, published for adolescents in 1915 and entitled, What Every Boy and Girl Should Know, featured a jarring afterword:</p><p>It is a vicious cycle; ignorance breeds poverty and poverty breeds ignorance. There is only one cure for both, and that is to stoop breeding these things. Stop bringing to birth children whose inheritance cannot be one of health or intelligence. Stop bringing into the world children whose parents cannot provide for them.</p><p>To Sanger, the ebbing away of moral and religious codes over sexual conduct was a natural consequence of the worthlessness of such codes in the individual's search for self-fulfillment. "Instead of laying down hard and fast rules of sexual conduct," Sanger wrote in her 1922 book Pivot of Civilization, "sex can be rendered effective and valuable only as it meets and satisfies the interests and demands of the pupil himself." Her attitude is appropriately described as libertinism, but sex knowledge was not the same as individual liberty, as her writings on procreation emphasized.</p><p>The second edition of Sanger's life story, An Autobiography, appeared in 1938. There Sanger described her first cross-country lecture tour in 1916. Her standard speech asserted seven conditions of life that "mandated" the use of birth control: the third was "when parents, though normal, had subnormal children"; the fourth, "when husband and wife were adolescent"; the fifth, "when the earning capacity of the father was inadequate." No right existed to exercise sex knowledge to advance procreation. Sanger described the fact that "anyone, no matter how ignorant, how diseased mentally or physically, how lacking in all knowledge of children, seemed to consider he or she had the right to become a parent."</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Religious Bigotry</font></p><p>In the 1910's and 1920's, the entire social order–religion, law, politics, medicine, and the media–was arrayed against the idea and practice of birth control. This opposition began in 1873 when an overwhelmingly Protestant Congress passed, and a Protestant president signed into law, a bill that became known as the Comstock Law, named after its main proponent, Anthony Comstock. The U.S. Congress classified obscene writing, along with drugs, and devices and articles that prevented conception or caused abortion, under the same net of criminality and forbade their importation or mailing.</p><p>Sanger set out to have such legislation abolished or amended. Her initial efforts were directed at the Congress with the opening of a Washington, D.C., office of her American Birth Control League in 1926. Sanger wanted to amend section 211 of the U.S. criminal code to allow the interstate shipment and mailing of contraceptives among physicians, druggists and drug manufacturers.</p><p>During January and February of 1926, Sanger and her co-workers personally interviewed 40 senators and 14 representatives. None agreed to introduce a bill to amend the Comstock Act. Fresh from this unanimous rejection, Sanger issued an update to her followers: Everywhere there is general acceptance of the idea, except in religious circles. . .The National Catholic Welfare Council [sic] (NCWC) has a special legislative committee organized to block and defeat our legislation. They frankly state that they intend to legislate for non-Catholics according to the dictates of the church.</p><p>There was no such committee. But 20 non-Catholic lay or religious organizations joined NCWC in opposition to amending the Comstock Act. This was not the first time, nor was it to be the last, that Sanger sought to stir up sectarian strife by blaming Catholics for her legislative failures. Catholic-bashing was a standard tactic (one that Planned Parenthood still finds useful to this day), although other Christian groups now also come in for criticism.</p><p>Eight years later, in 1934, Sanger went to Congress again. Reporting on the first day of the hearings, the New York Times noted: ... the almost solidly Catholic opposition to the measure. This is now, according to Margaret Sanger. . . the only organized opposition to the proposal.</p><p>Sanger wrote a letter to her "Friends, Co-workers, and Endorsers" that portrayed the opposing testimony as the work of Catholics determined ... not to present facts to the committee but to intimidate them by showing a Catholic block of voters who (though in the minority in the United States) want to dictate to the majority of non-Catholics as directed from the Vatican in social and moral legislation ... American men and women, are we going to allow this insulting arrogance to bluff the American people?</p><p>For Sanger, the proper attitude toward her religious critics featured character assassination, personal vilification and old-fashioned bigotry. Her Birth Control Review printed an article that noted: "Today by the Roman Catholic clergy and their allies . . . Public opinion in America, I fear, is too willing to condone in the officials of the Roman Catholic Church what it condemns in the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>A favorite Catholic-baiter of Sanger's was Norman E. Himes, who contributed articles to Sanger's journal. Himes claimed there were genetic differences between Catholics and non-Catholics.</p><p>Are Catholic stocks . . . genetically inferior to such non-Catholic libertarian stocks and Unitarians and Universal . . . Freethinkers? Inferior to non-Catholics in general? . . . my guess is that the answer will someday be made in the affirmative. . . and if the supposed differentials in net productivity are also genuine, the situation is anti-social, perhaps gravely so.</p><p>Sanger sought to isolate Catholics by creating a schism between them and Protestants, who had held parallel views of birth control and abortion for centuries. She welcomed a report from a majority of the Committee on Marriage and the Home of the General Council of Churches (later the National Council of Churches) advocating birth control. This committee was composed largely of social elite Protestants, including Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. A number of Protestant church bodies publicly repudiated the committee's endorsement.</p><p>The Rev. Worth Tippy, council executive secretary and author of the report, told Sanger in April 1931 that: ... the statement on Moral Aspects of Birth Control has aroused more opposition within the Protestant churches than we expected. Under the circumstances, and since we plan to carry on a steady work for liberalizing laws and to stimulate the establishment of clinics, it is necessary that we make good these losses and also increase our resources.Could you help me quietly by giving me the names of people of means who are interested in the birth control movement and might help us if I wrote them.</p><p>Sanger immediately wrote Tippy that she would be "glad to select names of persons from our lists whom I think might be able to subscribe." Tippy replied to Sanger a week later, offering to give her some names for fund raising and thanking her for the offer of "names of people who are able to contribute to generous causes and who are favorable to birth control." He also related that they had expected some reaction from the "fundamentalist groups," but nothing like what had happened.</p><p>Protestants repeatedly stated their unity with Catholics in opposing Planned Parenthood's initiatives. During Sanger's attempts to reform New York state law, another Protestant stood with Catholics. The Rev. John R. Straton, Pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church of New York City, said: "This bill is subversive of the human family . . . It is revolting, monstrous, against God's word and contradicts American traditions."</p><p>Sanger's attack on Catholics appeared to be an attempt to divert attention from the class politics of Planned Parenthood. The Rev. John A. Ryan wrote: ... their main objective is to increase the practice of birth-prevention among the poor . . . It is said that the present birth-prevention movement is to some extent financed by wealthy, albeit philanthropic persons. As far as I am aware , none of these is conspicuous in the movement for economic justice. None of them is crying out for a scale of wages which would enable workers to take care of a normal number of children.</p><p>Sanger's sexual license was another motivation for her Anti-Catholic sniping. A Sanger biographer, David M. Kennedy, said her primary goal was to "increase the quantity and quality of sexual relationships." The birth control movement, she said, freed the mind from "sexual prejudice and taboo, by demanding the frankest and most unflinching re-examination of sex in its relation to human nature and the basis of human society.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Sannger's Gamble</font></p><p>It was in 1939 that Sanger's larger vision for dealing with the reproductive practices of black Americans emerged. After the January 1939 merger of her Clinical Research Bureau and the ABCL to form the Birth Control Federation of America, Dr. Clarence J. Gamble was selected to become the BCFA regional director for the South. Dr. Gamble, of the soap-manufacturing Procter and Gamble company, was no newcomer to Sanger's organization. He had previously served as director at large to the predecessor ABCL.</p><p>Gamble lost no time and drew up a memorandum in November 1939 entitled "Suggestion for Negro Project." Acknowledging that black leaders might regard birth control as an extermination plot, he suggested that black leaders be place in positions where it would appear that they were in chargeÑas it was at an Atlanta conference.</p><p>It is evident from the rest of the memo that Gamble conceived the project almost as a traveling road show. A charismatic black minister was to start a revival, with "contributions" to come from other local cooperating ministers. A "colored nurse" would follow, supported by a subsidized "colored doctor." Gamble even suggested that music might be a useful lure to bring the prospects to a meeting.</p><p>Sanger answered Gamble on Dec. 10. 1939, agreeing with the assessment. She wrote: "We do not want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten that idea out if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members." In 1940, money for two "Negro Project" demonstration programs in southern states was donated by advertising magnate Albert D. Lasker and his wife, Mary.</p><p>Birth control was presented both as an economic betterment vehicle and as a health measure that could lower the incidence of infant mortality. At the 1942 BCFA annual meeting, BCFA Negro Council board member Dr. Dorothy B. Ferebee–a cum laude graduate of Tufts and also president of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation's largest black sorority–addressed the delegates regarding Planned Parenthood's minority outreach efforts&#160;: With the Negro group some of the most difficult obstacles . . . to overcome are: (1) the concept that when birth control is proposed to them, it is motivated by a clever bit of machination to persuade them to commit race suicide; (2) the so-called "husband rejection" . . . (3) the fact that birth control is confused with abortion, and (4) the belief that is inherently immoral. However, as formidable as these objections may seem, when thrown against the total picture of the awareness on the part of the Negro leaders of the improved condition under Planned Parenthood, or the genuine interest and eagerness of the families themselves to secure the services which will give them a fair chance for health and happiness, the obstacles to the program are greatly outweighed.</p><p>Birth control as an economic improvement measure had some appeal to those lowest on the income ladder. In the black Chicago Defender for Jan. 10, 1942, a long three-column women's interest article discussed the endorsement of the Sanger program by prominent black women. There were at lease six express references, such as the following example, to birth control as a remedy for economic woes:" . . . it raises the standard of living by enabling parents to adjust the family size to the family income." Readers were also told that birth control" . . . is no operation. It is no abortion. Abortion kills life after it has begun. . . Birth Control is neither harmful nor immoral."</p><p>But the moral stumbling block could only be surmounted by Afro-American religious leaders, so black ministers were solicited. Florence Rose, long-time Sanger secretary, prepared an activities report during March 1942 detailing the progress of the "Negro Project." She recounted a recent meeting with a Planned Parenthood Negro Division board member, Bishop David H. Sims (African Methodist Episcopal Church), who appreciated Planned Parenthood's recognition of the extent of black opposition to birth control and its efforts to build up support among black leaders. He offered whatever assistance he could give.</p><p>Bishop Sims offered to begin the "softening process" among the representatives of different Negro denominations attending the monthly meetings of the Federal Council of Churches and its Division of Race Relations.</p><p>These and other efforts paid off handsomely after World War II. By 1949, virtually the entire black leadership network of religious, social, professional, and academic organizations had endorsed Planned Parenthood's program.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">National Scandal</font></p><p>More than a decade later, Planned Parenthood continued targeting minority communities, but without much success.</p><p>In 1940, nonwhite women aged 18 to 19 experienced 61 births per 1,000 unmarried women. In 1968, the corresponding figure was 112 per 1,000, a 100 percent jump. What other factor could account for the increased rate of sexual activity than wider access to birth control, with its promise of sex without tears and consequences?</p><p>Alan Guttmacher, then president of Planned Parenthood, was desperate to show policy-makers that birth control would produce a situation whereby "minority groups who constantly outbreed the majority will no longer persist in doing so. . . "</p><p>Despite claims that racial or ethnic groups were not being "targeted," American blacks, among whose ranks a greater proportion of the poor were numbered, received a high priority in Planned Parenthood's nationwide efforts. Donald B. Strauss, chairman of Planned ParenthoodÑWorld Population, urged the 1964 Democratic national Convention to liberalize the party's stated policies on birth control, and to adopt domestic and foreign policy platform resolutions to conform with long-sought San gerite goals: [While almost one-fourth of nonwhite parents have four or more children under 18 living with them, only 8% of the white couples have that many children living at home. For the Negro parent in particular, the denial of access to family planning professional guidance forecloses one more avenue to family advancement and well-being..</p><p>Unwanted children would not get the job training and educational skills they needed to compete in a shrinking labor market; moreover, unwanted children are a product and a cause of poverty.</p><p>Surveying the "successes" of tax-subsidized birth control programs, Guttmacher noted in 1970 that "[Birth control services are proliferating in areas adjacent to concentrations of black population." (In the 1980's, targeting the inner-city black communities for school based sex clinics became more sensitive than expected.)</p><p>Guttmacher thought that as long as the birth rate continued to fall or remained at a low level, Planned Parenthood should certainly be introduced before family size by coercion is attempted."</p><p>Reaching this goal, he thought, would best be accomplished by having groups other than the PPFA preach the doctrine of a normative 2.1-child family, as doing this would offend Planned Parenthood's minority clients. He suggested that family size would decrease if abortion were liberalized nationwide and received government support. In this prediction he was right on target.</p><p>But Guttmacher did not completely reject forced population control: Predicting 20 critical years ahead in the struggle to control the population explosion, Dr. Alan Guttmacher, president of Planned parenthoodÑWorld Population, continues to urge the use of all voluntary means to hold down on the world birthrate. But he foresees the possibility that eventual coercion may become necessary, particularly in areas where the pressure is greatest, possibly India and China. "Each country," he says, "will have to decide its own form of coercion, and determine when and how it should be employed. At Present, the means are compulsory sterilization and compulsory abortion. Perhaps some day a way of enforcing compulsory birth control will be feasible.</p><p>Coerced abortion is already practiced in China, with the International Planned Parenthood Federation's approval.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Extreme Irony</font></p><p>Despite its past, Planned Parenthood has managed to present the image of toleration and minority participation through the vehicle of its divorced, telegenic, African American president, Ms. Faye Wattleton, appointed titular head of the PPFA in 1978, a post she still holds. Though paid in the six-figure range, she has impeccable minority credentials that would have fit the public relations criteria for both Margaret Sanger and Dr. Clarence Gamble.</p><p>Wattleton's PPFA biography touts her as a friend of the "Poor and the young"; a nurse at Harlem Hospital; and the recipient of the 1989 Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Humanitarian Award and the World Institute of Black Communicators' 1986 Excellence in Black Communications Award. It further states she was featured in a national photography exhibit, "I Dream A World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America"; interviewed in Ebony; and was the cover story in Black Enterprise magazine. (Time published a profile of Wattleton in 1990 entitled "Nothing Less Than Perfect.")</p><p>Her ideological orientation has received certification in the form of the Better World Society's 1989 Population Model, the 1986 American Humanist Award, and others. But surely, the spectacle of the Congressional Black Caucus awarding its humanitarian award to the black woman who presides over the organization that has hastened and justified the death of almost eight million black children since 1973 and facilitates the demise of the black family is ironic in the extreme.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="new" title="Image:41GSC1HD4YLAA240.jpg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=41GSC1HD4YLAA240.jpg"><img width="240" height="240" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/41GSC1HD4YLAA240.jpg" /></a></p><p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"><strong>Killer Angel</strong> book by George Grant Bio of Margaret Sanger</font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://freebooks.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/39ba_47e.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://freebooks.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/39ba_47e.htm">http://freebooks.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/39ba_47e.htm</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p>In his book, Killer Angel, George Grant says: "Myths, according to theologian J. l. packer, are Ôstories made up to sanctify social patterns.' They are lies, carefully designed to reinforce a particular philosophy or morality within a culture. They are instruments of manipulation and control.</p><p>Killer Angel tells the real story behind one of the biggest myths that controls our culture todayÑthe life and legacy of Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood. Grant exposes "the Big Lie" perpetuated by Sanger's followers and the organization she started.</p><p>Through detailed research and concise writing, Grant unveils Sanger's true character and ideology, which included blatant racism, revolutionary socialism, sexual perversion and insatiable avarice. Grant includes direct quotes from sources such as Sanger's Birth Control Review to support his findings. His biography spans Sanger's disturbed and unhappy upbringingÑwhich Sanger said contributed to her agitation and bitterness later in lifeÑto her eventual fixation with drugs, alcohol and the occult.</p><p>Particularly shocking was Sanger's involvement in the Eugenics movement. Grant says: "[Sanger] was thoroughly convinced that the Ôinferior races' were in fact Ôhuman weeds' and a Ômenace to civilization.' . . . [S]he was a true believer, not simply someone who assimilated the jargon of the timesÑas Planned Parenthood officials would have us believe."</p><p>Sanger died September 6, 1966, a week before her eighty-seventh birthday. Grant says: "[She] had nearly fulfilled her early boast that she would spend every last penny of Slee's [her second husband] fortune. In the process, though, she had lost everything else: love, happiness, satisfaction, fulfillment, family, and friends. In the end, her struggle was her naught."</p><p>The truth uncovered in grant's book has proven to be a threat to those who follow the cult of&#160;:Planned Parenthood. In fact, Killer Angel was recently banned from a public library in Toledo, Ohio. A library manager stated in a letter that, "The author's political and social agenda, which is strongly expoused throughout the book, is not appropriate even in a critical biography of its subject."</p><p>In response, Grant pointed out that "The question at hand is whether librarians should be making subjective judgments about my political beliefs and the beliefs of other authors."</p><p>By censoring Killer Angel, the library appears to be violating its own policies, which state that, "the Library collection shall include representative materials of all races and nationalities, and all political, religious, economic and social views." Except Christian views, apparently.</p><p>While the Toledo public library may not be interested in the information put forth in Grant's book, pro-lifers will find this biography useful and enlightening. It serves as a powerful tool in dispelling the myths surrounding a womanÑconsidered a heroine by manyÑwho began an organization that is responsible for the deaths of millions of unborn children.</p><p>Grant states that, "Margaret SangerÑand her heirs at Planned Parenthood . . . have thus far been able to parlay the deception into a substantial empire. But now the truth must be told. The illusion must be exposed." Killer Angel does an outstanding job in doing that. Sanger's Legacy is Reproductive Freedom and Racism</p><p>Despite Margaret Sanger's contributions to birth control and hence women's freedom and empowerment, her legacy is diminished by her sympathies with eugenics. This writer says that, like many modern feminists, Sanger ignored class and race.</p><p>(WOMENSENEWS)--Margaret Sanger opened the nation's first birth control clinic in 1916. For the rest of her life she worked to establish a woman's right to control her body and to decide when or whether to have a child. In 1921, she founded the American Birth Control league, the forerunner of Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Her impact on contemporary society is tremendous. Enabling women to control their fertility and giving them access to contraception, as advocated by Sanger, makes it possible for women to have a broader set of life options, especially in the areas of education and employment, than if their lives are dominated by unrelieved childbearing.</p><p>A recent reminder of Sanger's impact on our society came when the Equal employment Opportunity Commission found that it is illegal sex discrimination to exclude prescription contraceptives from an otherwise comprehensive health benefits plan. Sanger's efforts to provide access to contraception are at the foundation of decisions to provide equal access to prescription contraceptives and other prescriptions.</p><p>Still, especially with the Bush administration, activists will have to fight to maintain access to contraception and to abortion. In April, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would establish criminal penalties for harming a fetus during the commission of a crime. While proponents of the bill say it does not include abortion, some see fetal protection legislation as an attempt to undermine abortion rights. The passage of this legislation is a reminder that the rights Margaret Sanger worked so hard to establish are tenuous rights that many would challenge.</p><p>For all her positive influence, I see Sanger as a tarnished heroine whose embrace of the eugenics movement showed racial insensitivity, at best. From her associates, as well as from some of the articles that were published in Sanger's magazine, the Birth Control review, it is possible to conclude that "racially insensitive" is too mild a description. Indeed, some of her statements, taken in or out of context, are simply racist. And she never rebuked eugenicists who believed in improving the hereditary qualities of a race or breed by controlling mating in order to eliminate "undesirable" characteristics and promote "desirable" traits.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Sanger: We Must Limit the Over-Fertility of Mentally, Physically Defective</font></p><p>"Our failure to segregate morons who are increasing and multiplying . . . demonstrates our foolhardy and extravagant sentimentalism," she wrote in the recently republished "The Pivot of Civilization." This book, written in 1922, was published at a time when scientific racism had been used to assert black inferiority. Who determines who is a moron? How would these morons be segregated? The ramifications of such statements are bone chilling.</p><p>In a 1921 article in the Birth Control Review, Sanger wrote, "The most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective." Reviewers of one of her 1919 articles interpreted her objectives as "More children from the fit, less from the unfit." Again, the question of who decides fitness is important, and it was an issue that Sanger only partly addressed. "The undeniably feebleminded should indeed, not only be discouraged but prevented from propagating their kind," she wrote.</p><p>Sanger advocated the mandatory sterilization of the insane and feebleminded." Although this does not diminish her legacy as the key force in the birth control movement, it raises questions much like those now being raised about our nation's slaveholding founders. How do we judge historical figures? How are their contributions placed in context?</p><p>It is easy to see why there is some antipathy toward Sanger among people of color, considering that, given our nation's history, we are the people most frequently described as "unfit" and "feebleminded."</p><p>Many African American women have been subject to nonconsensual forced sterilization. Some did not even know that they were sterilized until they tried, unsuccessfully, to have children. In 1973, Essence Magazine published an expose of forced sterilization practices in the rural South, where racist physicians felt they were performing a service by sterilizing black women without telling them. While one cannot blame Margaret Sanger for the actions of these physician, one can certainly see why Sanger's words are especially repugnant in a racial context.</p><p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has been protective of Margaret Sanger's reputation and defensive of allegations that she was a racist. They correctly point out that many of the attacks on Sanger come from anti-choice activists who have an interest in distorting both Sanger's work and that of Planned Parenthood. While it is understandable that Planned Parenthood would be protective of their founder's reputation, it cannot ignore the fact that Sanger edited the Birth Control review from its inception until 1929. Under her leadership, the magazine featured articles that embraced the eugenicist position. If Sanger were as anti-eugenics as Planned Parenthood says she was, she would not have printed as many articles sympathetic to eugenics as she did.</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4">Like Many Modern Feminists, Sanger Ignored Race and Class</font></strong></p><p>Would the NAACP's house organ, Crisis Magazine, print articles by members of the Ku Klux Klan? Would Planned Parenthood publish articles penned by fetal protectionist South Carolina republican Lindsey Graham?</p><p>The articled published in the Birth Control Review showed Sanger's empathy with some eugenicist views. Margaret Sanger worked closely with W. E. B. DuBois on her "Negro Project," an effort to expose Southern black women to birth control. Mary McLeod Bethune and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. were also involved in the effort. Much later, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. accepted an award from Planned Parenthood and complimented the organization's efforts. It is entirely possible that Sanger Ôs views evolved over time. Certainly, by the late 1940s, she spoke about ways to solve the "Negro problem" in the United States. This evolution, however commendable, does not eradicate the impact of her earlier statements.</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4">What, then, is Sanger's legacy?</font></strong></p><p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has grown to an organization with 129 affiliates. It operates 875 health centers and serves about 5 million women each year. Planned Parenthood has been a leader in the fight for women's right to choose and in providing access to affordable reproductive health care for a cross-section of women. Planned Parenthood has not supported forced sterilization or restricted immigration and has gently rejected the most extreme of Sanger's views.</p><p>In many ways, Sanger is no different from contemporary feminists who, after making the customary acknowledgement of issues dealing with race and class, return to analysis that focuses exclusively on gender. These are the feminists who feel that women should come together around "women's issues" and battle out our differences later. In failing to acknowledge differences and the differential impact of a set of policies, these feminists make it difficult for women to come together.</p><p>Sanger published the Birth Control Review at the same time that black men, returning from World War I, were lynched in uniform. That she did not see the harm in embracing exclusionary jargon about sterilization and immigration suggests that she was, at best, socially myopic.</p><p>That's reason enough to suggest that her leadership was flawed and her legacy crippled by her insensitivity.</p><p><br /><strong>Order Pastor Childress' new book "No Shepherd's Cry"</strong></p><p>L.E.A.R.N.

To suggest that Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist is to raise the ire of many of the present-day leaders of Planned Parenthood and other anti-life organizations. However, the facts do speak for themselves.</p><p>For example, throughout the pages of the Birth Control Review, Mrs. Sanger's journal, there are countless quotes which not only suggest that she favored eugenics, but that she provided a forum to those who wished to spread their fear of human life, when that life was conceived by someone other than a member of society's elite.</p><p>This brochure is devoted to familiarizing you with the most outrageous of the statements to which Mrs. Sanger gave credence, as well as to a few of her own. Since books have been written about her, it is not necessary for us to go into her sordid background at length, but simply to give you a taste of the hypocrisy which has led so many people into the web Planned Parenthood weaves, even today. It is a web that distorts, misrepresents and ultimately cheapens the beautiful gift of human sexuality which God gives to each and every person at conception.</p><p><em><strong>Who Was Margaret Sanger?</strong></em></p><p>Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was an adulteress, racist and bigot, a supporter of Hitler's Nazi party, and a believer in eugenics - the purification of a particular race of people by selective breeding. Her magazines and journals were filled with writings and articles by well-known eugenicists and members of Hitler's Third Reich.</p><p><em><strong>Marriage:</strong></em></p><p>Sanger made every effort to promote philosophies which would assist the state in controlling the size of families. However, with regard to her own family, her first husband William Sanger, her children, and her subsequent divorce, she wrote in her 1931 book, My Fight for Birth Control:</p><p>"'My first marriage failed, not because of love, romance, lack of wealth, respect or any such qualities which are supposed to be lacking in broken ties, because the interest of each widened beyond that of the other". "From the deep waters into which I had been swept by the current of events it was impossible to return to the shallow pool of domesticity'"</p><p>The wife who is able to stay at home and care for her family because she wants to is characterized by Sanger as someone who is simply drowning in a "shallow pool of domesticity," an attitude con-sistently promulgated in today's society by the feminist movement and those who have relegated motherhood to the lowest level of achievement.</p><p><em><strong>Adultery:</strong></em></p><p>After a failed trial marriage at 18, she married William Sanger in 1902 and soon engaged in extramarital affairs while encouraging her husband to do the same. She pronounced the marriage bed to be "the most degenerating influence in the social order" and advocated a "voluntary association" between sexual partners.</p><p>At the beginning of her "mission" to bring birth control to America, around 1912, she saw birth control as a tool in the class struggle and was clearly on the side of the poor.</p><p>However, her involvement with well-known socialists and eugenicists of the day (Eugene Debs, Emma Goldman, Will Durant, Clarence Darrow, and Ellen Key) changed her mind completely. Over a period of eight years she began to turn the birth control movement against the very people she had set out to help.</p><p><em><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong></em></p><p>Mrs. Sanger, who did not have faith in God, and detested all those who did, wrote:</p><p>"I never liked to look at Jesus on the Cross. I could not see any good it did to keep looking at him. We could not help him, as he had been crucified long ago."</p><p>To know Christ and to appreciate His suffering, death and resurrection for each and every one of us would obviously have been foreign to Mrs. Sanger. To her, after all, many of those created in the image and likeness of God were simply less than human.</p><p><em><strong>The Pivot of Civilization:</strong></em></p><p>Instead of helping the poor, she considered them slum dwellers (particularly Blacks, Hispanics, and Jewish immigrants) who would soon overrun the boundaries of their slums, contaminating the better elements of society with their diseases and inferior genes.</p><p>Throughout the 200+ pages of this book Sanger called for the elimination of "human weeds," for the cessation of charity, for the segregation of "morons, misfits, and maladjusted," and for the sterilization of "genetically inferior races."[4] In this same book she argued that organized attempts to help the poor were the "surest sign that our civilization has bred, is breeding, and is perpetuating . . . defectives, delinquents, and dependents."[5] She called for coercive sterilization, mandatory segregation, and rehabilitative concentration camps for all inferior Blacks, Hispanics, poor Whites, and Catholics.</p><p>Sanger's brand of prejudice was based on what author John L. Keller labels "Scientific Racism," the belief that as long as people demonstrated "a good quality gene pool" they were esteemed a valuable part of society. On the other hand, if a group, including Whites, demonstrated undesirable traits, their fertility had to be curbed along with other "inferiors and undesirables."</p><p>George Grant stated in Grand Illusions: "In her book Women and the New Race she asserted that the 'most merciful thing a large family can do to one of its infant members is to kill it.'"</p><p><em><strong>Minorities:</strong></em></p><p>On October 19, 1939, Sanger outlined a plan for stopping the growth of the Black community. She predicted that "the most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their rebellious members."[8] Her planning, which included being careful to make it appear that hand-picked Blacks are in control, is followed with success even today. Faye Wattleton's position as President of PPFA was testimony to that fact.</p><p><em><strong>The Birth Control Review:</strong></em></p><p>The Birth Control Review, founded by Sanger in 1917, was totally committed to the eugenics philosophy. The official editorial policy of The Review endorsed I.Q. testing, which classified Blacks, southern Europeans, and other immigrants as mentally inferior to native-born White Americans and called them a nuisance and a menace to society. In the 1920s she tried to use the results from I.Q. tests, which classified the U.S. soldier as a near moron, to back up her own findings.</p><p>Sanger truly believed these groups were a "dead weight of human waste" and "a menace to the race."</p><p><em><strong>Abortion and Birth Control:</strong></em></p><p>It was in the December, 1918, Birth Control Review that Margaret Sanger wrote perhaps the most ingenious comment of all: ". . . I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization. . ."</p><p>How do you sell the practice of contraception to a public that is totally opposed to it? In 1918, when she wrote the above, no religious denomination accepted the practice of contraception. Well, you sell it to the people by insisting that with better contraception there would be less abortion! It sounds very familiar, doesn't it?</p><p>Today, it is only the Roman Catholic Church that stands for the truth with regard to contraception, and among its members it is said that eighty percent practice contraception anyway. Would Mrs. Sanger be proud of her campaign if she could see the results we live with today - more than 50 strains of VD as well as the deadly AIDS virus?</p><p>And would she agree with current Planned Parenthood president Pamela Maraldo, who writes: "As Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders has so succinctly put it: 'We've taught our children in driver's education what to do in the front seat, and now we've got to teach them what to do in the back seat.'"</p><p>Today American youth are told that the "responsible" thing to do is use contraception, be realistic and formulate your own values as you go, and if your contraception fails, get an abortion.[13] Responsible? Mrs. Sanger would be proud.</p><p>Thus through Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood has molded the sexual ethics of the day: Sex is a natural thing for a teenager to desire and if a teenager feels that he is to be sexually active that is his decision; all society asks is that he not produce children.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><font size="4">OTHER LINKS:</font></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://dianedew.com/sanger.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://dianedew.com/sanger.htm">http://dianedew.com/sanger.htm</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://dianedew.com/black.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://dianedew.com/black.htm">http://dianedew.com/black.htm</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://www.eadshome.com/MargaretSanger.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eadshome.com/MargaretSanger.htm">http://www.eadshome.com/MargaretSanger.htm</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://blackgenocide.org/planned.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://blackgenocide.org/planned.html">http://blackgenocide.org/planned.html</a></p><p>This quote from <a class="external free" title="http://lifedynamics.com/DeathCamps/Holocaust6.cfm" rel="nofollow" href="http://lifedynamics.com/DeathCamps/Holocaust6.cfm">http://lifedynamics.com/DeathCamps/Holocaust6.cfm</a> <a class="external free" title="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/</a> birthcontrol/bio-margaret-sanger.xml collaborates her desire to enlist black ministers to further her efforts to exterminate them:</p><p>“In 1930, Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city's health and social services.

Here is an insightful article into the tragic history of a woman who created a ravenous beast, a wolf in sheep's clothing, that has devoured generations of women and children. Her name is Margaret Sanger and the infamous organization she started is known today as Planned Parenthood. Here is her tainted legacy and bloodlust heritage that has survived her passing and her eternal reward.</p><p>As you read this article, our Lord's words are quite fitting, "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them (Matthew 7:15-20)."</p><p>HER CAUSE WAS A DIRE NECESSITY</p><p>Margaret Sanger &amp; 'The New Woman'</p><p>September 2006 By Anne Barbeau Gardiner</p><p>Anne Barbeau Gardiner is a Contributing Editor of the NOR. She has published on Dryden, Milton, and Swift, as well as on Catholics of the 17th century, and is Professor Emerita of English at John Jay College of the City University of New York.</p><p>Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, saw herself as "The New Woman," one emancipated from traditional religion and morality, empowered to have sex without procreation, and able to compete publicly with men. Yet behind this facade was a soul lost in emptiness and degradation.</p><p>An atheist who scorned all hope of an afterlife, Margaret Sanger lived entirely for the here and now. Born in 1879, she married twice and cheated on both spouses. Her first husband, whom she wed in August 1902 and divorced in 1921, was the socialist Bill Sanger. With him she had three much-neglected children. While married to Bill -- and this is proven by letters and journals that survive -- she had many affairs, some lasting for years, with such men as the Editor of American Parade Walter Roberts, the well-known English sexologist Havelock Ellis, the Spanish radical Lorenzo Portet, and the English patrician Hugh de Selincourt, as well as his wife Janet. These are facts, not rumors or suspicions, since her adulteries are well documented in the definitive biography, Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America written by Ellen Chesler, who makes use of the archives in Smith College and the Library of Congress. Why did Margaret not destroy these compromising papers? Like a female Dorian Gray, she kept her scabrous self hidden away for her entire life. But perhaps she thought that was long enough and wanted to be "outed" after her death.</p><p>A rich friend from early days, Mabel Dodge, recalled that Margaret was the first woman she ever knew who openly propagandized the pleasures of the flesh "as a sacred and at the same time a scientific reality." This is a crucial point: It was Margaret's trademark to speak of sex with a combination of sentiment and science. Science here means the pseudo-science of eugenics, part of Herbert Spencer's religion of evolutionism, which was a public craze at that time. Margaret and her associates wanted to legalize not just birth control, but also forced sterilization of the "unfit," so those classes would breed less and ease the burden on rich taxpayers. In the 1920s she was subsidized by a set of wealthy people who dabbled in population control (as the ultra-rich still do today). These millionaires imagined that they were the "fit" class and that they could seize the reins from Nature and direct the evolution of the human species to a higher level. Mostly they wanted to ensure that the breeding of inferior classes would be curtailed. Angela Franks has recently published an important work, Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy, which demonstrates how deeply the founder of Planned Parenthood was implicated in eugenics and in the Spencerian faith in evolutionism.</p><p>(Side note: The local Planned Parenthood is supported by the "who's who" in Waco, TX. The rich, elite class of our community are ardent in their defense of the indefensible performed by Planned Parenthood. There is nothing new under the sun).</p><p>These two ways of looking at sex -- sacred and scientific -- would be contradictory if not for the fact that sacred here is only a smokescreen to hide the main point -- that human sex is nothing more than the crude coupling of animals. When Margaret was going around lecturing about the need for medical control of human breeding and lacing her talks with sentimental rhetoric, she was only repeating what she had learned in England in 1914 from her mentor Havelock Ellis, also an atheist. Ellis taught that sex was a matter of biology and anthropology, but it could have a spiritual dimension. A precursor of Kinsey, Ellis produced the first clinical study of homosexuals, claimed their orientation was genetic, and demanded legal protection for them. He supported co-education and sex-education for children, as well as organized feminism, and he labeled as normal even the sexual perversions of sadism and masochism. Chesler says that it is "virtually impossible to overestimate" his influence on Margaret Sanger. She imbibed his theories uncritically and formed from them the basis of her birth-control agenda. She also saw his teaching as a green light for her own misbehavior.</p><p>Later, though, when Ellis's memoirs came out posthumously in 1940, Margaret was disappointed at the romantic nostalgia with which he wrote about his marriage to Edith, a lesbian. (Part of this was the result of guilt, since his sexual infatuation with Margaret had hastened his wife's death.) Margaret complained that these memoirs "undermined the empirical scientific basis of Ellis's sex research and theory," which had been the "foundation" of "her own life and work." Here she made it perfectly clear that a "scientific" approach to sex was the groundwork of her Birth Control League, later to be called Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Margaret's second husband was Noah Slee, a multi-millionaire who was 20 years her senior and who left his wife within months of meeting Margaret. They were married in September 1922. At the time, Noah was unaware that Margaret -- even in the weeks leading up to their wedding -- was meeting secretly with multiple sex partners in England. In 1924 she would also add Harold Child and H.G. Wells to her list of playmates across the pond. Wells once flattered her by saying she had a "scientific quality of mind," a compliment on which she preened herself even to old age. In the 1920s she also became sexually involved with three Americans: Bill Williams, Herbert Simonds, and Harold Hersey. From 1933 to 1935, in her mid-fifties, she engaged in an affair with Angus Sneed MacDonald, explaining at the end that she could not marry him because it would damage her reputation to be twice-divorced. Thus, the New Woman had to weigh private pleasures against the public appearance of virtue. Even in the 1940s, when she was in her mid-sixties, she had a six-year fling with Hobson Pittman, a landscape painter who was 20 years her junior. She told close friends that he was for fun, "not for keeps," and that she dared not marry him, for fear of what the press might say.</p><p>Her first husband was aware of her infidelities. In response to his rebukes, she insinuated that their marriage might survive if their adulteries were mutual. It was his fault, then, if he was unadventurous, for she would accept no blame for her conduct -- such being "the way of an adulterous woman, who eats and wipes her mouth and says, 'I have done no evil'" (Prov. 30:20). Her second husband, Noah, seems to have been blind to her doings. She managed to keep him in the dark by making him sign a prenuptial contract, pledging that she would have her separate residence with separate keys and that she, the New Woman, would retain full freedom to visit and entertain friends in privacy. She guarded this privacy fiercely -- as well she might. Such was the founder of Planned Parenthood. And since figs are not gathered from thorns, or grapes from the bramble bush, the organization which sprang from Ellis and Sanger still keeps the same drumbeat today, now urging the privacy rights of minors -- little girls lured into promiscuity by sex-education, then advised to have abortions without parental knowledge or consent.</p><p>(Side note: No matter how much our local Planned Parenthood declares their Nobody's Fool annual event is mainstream, the vision and mission remains the same. It is their annual recruitment drive to indoctrinate young people into their pagan sex philosophies to ensure future clients at their birth control/abortion business).</p><p>How empty is a life spent running from one sex partner to another! St. Augustine speaks of how people like her are in endless motion, yet going nowhere -- how they "go about and stand not, how they go in the circle of error, where the journeying is without end." Again and again she confided to her journal that she was lonely, depressed, even despairing -- yet she never changed. By then, maybe, she could no longer change, since vice had turned to addiction, a form of slavery. Though she found no joy in being the New Woman, she made it her life's work to "liberate" other women, too, from chastity and "involuntary motherhood" by means of her Birth Control League.</p><p>(Side note: Can you imagine the condition of the souls that work day in and day out at the Planned Parenthood's abortion mills)?</p><p>Besides this, she had an addiction to vainglory. The stories she told about herself were peppered with lies meant to make her more admirable. She was the sixth of 11 children born to poor Irish parents, but she longed to be of the privileged class, at least by marriage, so she used to claim that Bill Sanger's father had been an English merchant and his mother the daughter of a German mayor. She knew perfectly well that her father-in-law was a Jew who had immigrated in 1878 and worked in the garment district. Moreover, having little formal education but being gifted in the art of imitation, Margaret took over the feminist agenda and rhetoric of Emma Goldman, without so much as a thank you. Much of her talk about "voluntary motherhood" through contraception came from Goldman, but she pretended it was of her own devising, never acknowledging any debt in her autobiographies, and in 1934 even refusing to support Goldman's attempt to regain U.S. citizenship. And here is another instance of how she rewrote her past life to raise herself: In 1939 she claimed that Havelock Ellis had guided her reading at the British Museum for a year and a half, when she had been under his tutelage for only a month and a half. Her fibs were meant to make her seem more ladylike, original, and educated than she really was.</p><p>In 1914, while traveling in Europe with Lorenzo Portet, Margaret sent home articles and letters in which she made her association with him public, but hid its sexual nature, intimating that she was the guest of Portet and his wife. Her biographer notes that beyond a handful of close friends -- not family members or colleagues -- no one knew of her Dionysian side. She rightly feared that the American public would turn in disgust from a birth-control movement championed by so disreputable a woman. From first to last, therefore, she wore the mask of virtue and pretended to fight for birth control for altruistic reasons, rather than because her private behavior made it a dire necessity. To this day, Planned Parenthood keeps up the same pretense of virtue, spreading and supporting unbridled sexuality, while purporting to be defending the rights of privacy and individual autonomy which are allegedly enshrined (though invisibly) in the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>(Side note: "And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works (2 Corinthians 14,15)."</p><p>To prove that what she really wanted was to free women from "involuntary motherhood," Margaret would recount again and again the same sob story about a married woman named Sadie Sachs, who allegedly died in front of her as a result of a second self-induced abortion. Her story presented Sadie as the hapless victim of benighted laws that denied poor Jewish immigrants like her easy access to birth control. Never mind that such immigrants were precisely those whose fertility the eugenicists associated with Margaret wanted to limit or suppress. Margaret provoked tears over Sadie's plight, then launched into the "scientific" side of sex and urged that the medical profession be put in control of women's fertility. To this day, Planned Parenthood uses the same sort of sentimental ploy to preach the message of medical control over late-term abortions and experimentation with embryos.</p><p>(Side note: Liberals always use exterme examples of horrendous circumstances to pull at the heartstrings of average Americans to make mainstream what otherwise would be unthinkable).</p><p>When Noah built her an estate in Fishkill, New York, in the 1920s, she wrote to her playmate Hugh: "If only I could fly by night to London to see you &amp; Havelock &amp; Harold -- I'd be ready to say this is paradise." Then, when she was in England in 1924 sleeping with two new partners, H.G. Wells and Harold Child, she sent Noah effusive love letters, protesting that "England is nothing without my adorable lover husband." She wrote to him at length about her meetings with Harold Child, but made their association look perfectly above board. In later years she would laugh about how she fooled her husband, as for instance on February 2, 1934, when she wrote to Angus MacDonald that she had lied to Noah and his guests about the flowers she had received. If her husband grew suspicious, she rebuked him sharply and then laughed about it later with her partner. Such conduct in a woman of 55 is infantile, and it is proof she had been going in a circle for a long time. No wonder Dante draws Hell as a set of closed circles.</p><p>After the stock-market crash of 1929, Noah was virtually ruined, so Margaret felt less obligated to be by his side. She pretended she was devoting herself night and day to the birth-control movement and would spend months without seeing him (he died in 1943). Even so, she would, like Thaïs the courtesan (sunk in excrement for flatteries to lovers in Dante's Inferno), send him flattering letters about what a terrific lover he was. When her husband grieved over the length of her absences, she told him in no uncertain terms that she was the New Woman who would never compromise her freedom or put aside her public work for any man. Sometimes, too, she used another ploy: She blamed him for misunderstanding her and thus for keeping her at a distance. Before his face, she was the aggrieved wife, but behind his back, a virtual Messalina.</p><p>At Noah's memorial service in Fishkill, Margaret gave herself a eulogy, declaring that she had always "fascinated" Noah, for she was the "quicksilver" that he could never "quite catch." Here she drew an uncannily accurate self-portrait. For quicksilver is mercury, a poisonous substance, and a person who is mercurial is cunning, restless, and unpredictable. Another time she told a sex partner that she was a "will o' the wisp." Again, she chose an eerily revealing image. For a will o' the wisp is a delusory light that dances over a swamp and leads night travelers astray, even to their death by drowning. On some level she seems to have known how destructive a woman she was.</p><p>Since Margaret was an atheist who denied the Redemption and the Resurrection, she found guilt and death nearly impossible to face. When her daughter Peggy died of pneumonia in 1915, shortly after Margaret's return from a year of cavorting abroad, she was haunted by the sound of halting footsteps (Peggy had limped from polio) and had nightmares of losing a child. She dreamed that she was in the middle of a disaster and worried about Peggy, and then she would realize in the dream that she had neglected her child for years and had no clue of her whereabouts. For help in this crisis she turned to the occult. Havelock Ellis introduced her to Rosicrucianism so she could empower herself by connecting to a "spark of divinity" within. He explained to her that science and this type of mysticism were not in conflict. Sunk in loneliness and despair, she would thereafter seek out psychics and theosophists to try to make contact with her child. Her dabbling in the occult led to a delusory comfort: She confided to a friend that she could now talk to her dead child and that she had created a space, separate from the rest of the world, in which Peggy could grow up to maturity. This Peter Pan substitute for the Resurrection did not keep her from bouts of depression, and her sexual escapades offered only temporary reprieves from dejection.</p><p>(Side note: Some in the abortion industry are flat out witches and warlocks, where their religion is feminist spiritually, goddess worship, and abortion is their bloody sacrament. Folks that work at our local Planned Parenthood are also religious. I don't know if any of them are involved with witchcraft, but some of them go to "churches." I've warned them time and again that they are following what the Bible calls "another Jesus, another spirit, and a different gospel." Any Church that allows people into their congregation with the blood of the innocent on their hands unrepented is apostate).</p><p>Toward the end of her life, she confessed that she had long ago "entrusted her spirit" to the Rosicrucian Society, yet she seemed to know little about the Society. In 1951, when she was in her 70s, she enrolled in a Rosicrucian mail-order course to learn more. From that course she became convinced that she would not die because, as her biographer reports, she saw that she "embodied the aspirations of all women on earth" and was "their chosen agent of liberation." Evidently, the Rosicrucians were not in the business of teaching humility! In 1954 she said in an interview that she liked the Rosicrucians "because of their interest in the enhanced spiritual powers of women and their sympathy for political feminism." In this fake spirituality she found fleeting compensation for the brutal emptiness of her scientific materialism.</p><p>After all that, it is not surprising to learn that Margaret had a rabid hatred of the Catholic Church. She rightly saw the Church as the great enemy and chief obstacle of the Birth Control League. In the 1920s Catholics presented a united front and gave public warnings that were clearly inspired and prophetic. They declared that legalizing birth control would lead to refined materialism and selfish individualism, would degrade marriage, would cause husband and wife to see each other as instruments of sexual gratification, and would weaken their self-control, as well as their capacity for self-denial. Even Gandhi agreed with the Catholic view when Margaret Sanger visited him and tried to bring him around to her worldview. Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes of New York put it bluntly: Easy access to artificial contraception would lead to a "wild orgy of atheism and immorality." These predictions have manifestly been fulfilled.</p><p>(Side note: Why did she just have hatred for the Catholic Church? Where was her hatred for the Protestant Church? Perhaps we Protestants were no threat to her evil agenda).</p><p>In the 1930s Catholics also gave prophetic warning that if Margaret Sanger and her Birth Control League had their way, the floodgates of pornography would be opened and abortion would soon be legalized. A generation before Roe v. Wade, they could see that legalized abortion was around the corner once easy access to birth control made immorality rampant.</p><p>In conclusion, Margaret Sanger can be compared to Semiramis, the mythical queen of Babylon who supplanted her husband and made sexual immorality the law of the land. She did this because she herself was lascivious and her abrogation of virtue brought about the ruin of her nation. Margaret Sanger's private life was obviously the hidden spring of her public actions. This now has to be admitted. She worked tirelessly to overturn the laws against obscenity, birth control, and abortion mainly because her secret lifestyle made all these things necessary. For at the root of her agenda and that of Planned Parenthood was and is a pseudo-scientific view of human sexuality as something even lower than the coupling of animals.</p><p>IN KING JESUS' SERVICE,</p><p>Rusty Thomas</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;<img width="268" height="200" alt="" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/Images753.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/planned_parenthood.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/planned_parenthood.htm"><font size="4">http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/planned_parenthood.htm</font></a></p><p><br />

August 17, 2001 (Press Release)</p><p><strong>FINANCIAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), the nation's oldest and largest abortion provider, is an organization which is supported by U.S. taxpayers. For this reason, it is the most well funded abortion provider in the nation. In the period from 1987 until 1998, Planned Parenthood received a total of $1.4 billion in taxpayer money, according to Stop Planned Parenthood International (STOPP). PPFA received $176.5 million in government grants and contracts in the period between 1998-99, roughly 75% of which (or $132.4 million) originated from the federal government’s Title X and Title XIX programs. Forty-four million dollars was provided by state and local governments.</p><p>PPFA provided 1,939,039 abortions between the years 1977 and 1995. PPFA’s 1998-99 Annual Report reported that it provided 167,928 abortions in 1998 and 165,174 abortions in 1997. PPFA grossed $60 million in sales of the abortifacient Pill in the period 1997-98, and $45 million of that figure represented its net profit.</p><p>PPFA’s total revenue at the end of the 1999 fiscal year was $660.7 million. With its expenses reported at $534.9 million, the abortion provider reported a total profit of $125.8 million. Assets were reported at a cool $536.3 million for this “non-profit” organization.</p><p>PPFA receives financial support from many millionaires, corporations and foundations, including the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations and billionaire investor Warren Buffet’s foundation.</p><p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) $8.8 million in 2000.

While Planned Parenthood believes that women should have access to information about all factors that influence the risk of disease, PPFA also believes that women deserve information that is medically substantiated and untainted by a political agenda. Because the research community has not reached a consensus on breast cancer and abortion, Planned Parenthood advises women who are considering terminating a pregnancy that there is no currently demonstrated health risk from abortion that would warrant basing a decision on that factor alone. {Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., "Abortion and Breast Cancer: The Issues" 3 (visited Sep. 5, 1997) &lt;<a class="external free" title="http://www.igc.apc.org/ppfa/ab-breas.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.igc.apc.org/ppfa/ab-breas.html">http://www.igc.apc.org/ppfa/ab-breas.html</a>&gt;}.</p><p><br />
Planned Parenthood says that it "awaits conclusive confirmation" of the abortion-breast cancer link before it will inform women of the available studies. However, science cannot prove causation without performing unethical experiments on women. Induced abortion is rarely a life-or-death procedure. On the contrary, it is predominantly an elective surgical procedure. How many thousands more women will unwittingly risk a deadly disease because Planned Parenthood has not yet determined that it has “conclusive confirmation” of the abortion-breast cancer link?</p><p>The web site revealed that PPFA does recognize the possibility of an association between abortion and breast cancer. It explained the biological reasons for the abortion-breast cancer link:</p><p>Reproductive factors have been associated with risk for the disease since the 17th century . . . . It is known that having a full-term pregnancy early in a woman's childbearing years is protective against breast cancer . .. .. . The theory behind a possible link between pregnancy termination and breast cancer is based on the hormonal disruption that occurs when a woman's pregnancy is interrupted. Pregnancy initiates a surge of sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin), which leads to differentiation of the cells in the breast glands in preparation for lactation. The changing concentrations of hormones during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy lead to increased differentiation. In a first pregnancy, the results of these hormonal changes permanently alter the structure of the breast. Interruption during the first trimester of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation, which may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous growth in these tissues. {Id}.</p><p>On November 1, 1994 at a time when there were more than two dozen studies available which showed an association between induced abortion and breast cancer, NBC's news program, Dateline, interviewed the president of Planned Parenthood at that time, Pamela Maraldo, to discuss Planned Parenthood's informed consent policy. The following conversation took place between Maraldo and the reporter:</p><p>Reporter: "If indeed your panel of medical experts studies this study by Dr. Daling and you find it to be solid good science, what are the chances you will begin warning women about this possible link?”</p><p>Maraldo: "Even if it's solid good science, then to begin to warn women, and upset women, on the basis of one study is clearly irresponsible. One study is not an adequate, uh, uh -- evidence for us to change a policy, or -- or to upset or frighten women."</p><p>Reporter: "Five studies -- say you have five studies?"</p><p>Maraldo: "Well I think we're a long ways away from that."</p><p>Why is Planned Parenthood excluding women from this debate about their health? An increased risk of breast cancer would undoubtedly impact the decision making process for many women considering an abortion. Withholding vital information, which is needed to make an informed choice about health matters, is paternalistic censorship. Women have a right to know all of the risks associated with induced abortion.</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><br /><strong><a class="new" title="Dear Champion of the Lord and the Preborn," href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dear_Champion_of_the_Lord_and_the_Preborn%2C&amp;action=edit"><font size="4" color="#008080">Dear Champion of the Lord and the Preborn,</font></a></strong></p><p>The Lord richly bless you!

Apparently not. According to Chris Weinkopf, editorial-page editor of the Los Angeles Daily News, the California Department of Education reports that "96 percent of California school districts provide comprehensive sexual health education" and all California schools have been required to teach HIV/AIDS prevention education since 1992.</p><p>Can we blame the abstinence-only programs promoted by the Bush administration?</p><p>Not in California. Weinkopf notes that state law prohibits 'abstinence-only' education in the public schools. In addition, California may be the only state in the country that has refused to accept millions of federal dollars for abstinence education.</p><p>"This [soaring rate of sexually-transmitted infections] is no surprise," said Linda Klepacki, sexual health analyst for Focus on the Family Action in an online press release. "California has insisted on teaching contraceptive-based sex education in their schools all along. They expect teens to be sexually active. They don’t raise the health standard to abstinence… It's clear California supports sexually active teens, and STI rates will naturally explode with these policies."</p><p>Another factor in the out-of-control disease rates among California children and young adults may be the introduction of the “morning-after” pill. According to testimony offered to the FDA in 2004, sexually-transmitted infections soared in the British Isles when “Plan B” (the morning-after pill) was made available without prescription in 2000. Ignoring the warning signals from the UK, California subsequently became one of the first states to permit the sale of Plan B over-the-counter without an age limit. (Compiled testimony of Wendy Wright, Carole Denner, and Jill Stanek, "The Morning-After Pill: An Ill Wind This Way Blows.")</p><p>The new study on sexually-transmitted infections among young people in California was completed by the Center for Research on Adolescent Health and Development at the Public Health Institute in Oakland. Study author Dr. Petra Jerman told Medical News Today that the statistics revealed an epidemic of which, like an iceberg, only a small part is visible.</p><p>The authors acknowledged that their figures are underestimated because of incomplete screening of sexually active young people, and failure to confirm the effectiveness of treatment through follow-up testing.</p><p>Ed Thomas of OneNewsNow.com added another dimension to this distressing picture by reporting that a striking increase in suicide rates among people ages 10 to 24 has been confirmed by recently released statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control .</p><p>At the same time, says Thomas, UCLA psychiatrist Dr. Miriam Grossman is convinced that promiscuity is the root cause of much depression.

October 13, 2007</p><p>A substantial increase in suicide rates among people ages 10 to 24 has been confirmed by recently released statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). At the same time, a UCLA psychiatrist says promiscuity -- which she believes is the root cause of much depression -- is being ignored by doctors who choose to treat their patients with anti-depressants instead of psychiatric help.</p><p>Dr. Miriam Grossman says the problem with that option is that the CDC's report stated that young people taking depression medication are among the 8 percent jump in suicides -- evidence to Grossman that only symptoms are being addressed, and not causes. "There are approximately 1,100 successful suicides on our campuses every year -- a very, very startlingly high number," she says.</p><p><strong>Causes before cures</strong></p><p>To get to the root of the problem, Grossman says one has to backtrack to a related topic -- depression -- which she says is at epidemic levels on college campuses, and is usually closely related to suicide.</p><p>Furthermore, it is her assertion that there is a reason that is not discussed by the medical community for all the depression symptoms -- ranging from anxiety to insomnia, eating disorders and many other emotional problems. Grossman calls it "the anything goes sexual free-for-all" that exists among students, primarily on college campuses. "Parents need to know that dating is pretty much dead these days. College students hang out in groups, and then they pair off and 'hook up,'" she states.</p><p><strong>A new age?</strong></p><p>Grossman says a hook-up is defined as an unplanned sexual encounter between two people who do not have definite plans to speak again. "So you can understand that it's [a] no-strings-attached, no-emotions-attached, casual sort of set-up. And this is different than the way it was in past generations, because it's normalized ... and we have between 40 and 80 percent of college students participating in hooking up," she points out.</p><p>But with the rampant physical symptoms of depression, and the known biological changes that take place following sexual contact, can there really be no emotional, physical or spiritual after-effects of a morally neutral social lifestyle? Based on contacts with multitudes of students who regularly come to her office for treatment, Grossman definitely believes the answer is no.</p><p>Grossman authored the book Unprotected: A Campus Psychiatrist Reveals How Political Correctness in Her Profession Endangers Every Student. "My book is filled with stories of students who have come to me. They've followed the guidelines for 'safer sex,' and done everything the health center has told them to do -- and they still have ended up in my office, casualties of the hook-up culture," she states.</p><p><br />

Even though a Johnson County district judge found probable cause that Planned Parenthood committed these crimes, the organization claims the charges are simply political. But is a pattern of illegal activity starting to emerge? Are we starting to connect the dots?</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>The scope</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood is enormous. Even though it portrays itself as a grassroots organization, Planned Parenthood encompasses so much more.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>During its 2005-2006 fiscal year, Planned Parenthood reported a total income of $902.8 million. To provide perspective, this is more than the combined revenues during the same period for the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association. In Planned Parenthood’s almost-billion-dollar budget, $305.3 million came from you, the taxpayers.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>This money does not sit in a stale corporate office. It is obtained and used by 117 affiliates across the country. Planned Parenthood operates facilities in 859 locations that serve as local focal points to spread its philosophies throughout your communities.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>With this much money, personnel and locations, Planned Parenthood is a major force in the effort to sexualize America. Is it a leap to suggest that Planned Parenthood might have broken a few laws along the way?</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Statutory rape reporting</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Numerous cases suggest that Planned Parenthood does not properly report statutory rape. Under state laws, workers at Planned Parenthood clinics are mandatory reporters. It must report child abuse to the authorities. In every state, a child under 14 years of age cannot consent to sexual activity. If Planned Parenthood knows that a young child is sexually active with an older partner, it must report this activity. However, it doesn’t always do so.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood Golden Gate even bragged about one egregious case on its web site. It displayed a letter from a girl praising the clinic for keeping her rape secret. But the girl was 11 years old at the time of her rape by her 17-year-old boyfriend. After American Life League uncovered this story, Planned Parenthood promptly removed the letter, but did not even claim to have reported the rape to authorities.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Another alarming report came out of Waco, Texas. Planned Parenthood of Waco claims that it reports 98 statutory rape cases per year. However, Waco researchers dug into all official records and only found 7.3 reports per year. Planned Parenthood never explained the absence of each year’s 91 missing reports. Why isn’t it held accountable?</p><p>&#160;</p><p>With all these incidents of failed reporting, civil cases are cropping up. One terrible example comes from Denise Fairbanks in Ohio. This suit alleges that Planned Parenthood failed to report a father’s abuse of his daughter since she was 13 years old. Instead, Planned Parenthood performed an abortion on Denise and sent her home, allowing the abuse to continue for over a year. Finally, the father was convicted of sexual assault. Unfortunately, the deception does not end here.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Death cover-ups</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood provides invasive surgical procedures to its patients. Contrary to Planned Parenthood’s claims, abortions entail serious risks. Instead of promptly notifying health authorities when patients are injured, Planned Parenthood appears to cover up these incidents.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>In 2002, Diana Lopez bled to death after her cervix was punctured during an abortion at the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood. The California Department of Health Services cited Planned Parenthood for seven separate violations of health regulations, including failing to notify the health department of Ms. Lopez’s death within 24 hours. The other citations centered on failing to properly prepare for the procedure, advise the patient of risks and keep sufficient records about Ms. Lopez.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>While Planned Parenthood would claim this was an isolated incident, the facts say otherwise. Earlier this year, 21-year-old Edrica Goode died from toxic shock after beginning an abortion procedure through Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties. The California Department of Health Services again filed a deficiency ruling against Planned Parenthood for failing to report Ms. Goode’s death within 24 hours. After repeating this same violation, it begins to look like Planned Parenthood does not respect medical regulations.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Kansas criminal charges</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>With this short background on Planned Parenthood, the pending criminal charges in Kansas do not seem outlandish. By looking deeper into the charges, their substance and weight becomes even more apparent.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood was required to turn over 29 patient files for a government investigation. The files were completely sanitized of patient identification, so no breach of patient privacy existed. During the investigation, the Johnson County district attorney determined that all 29 files revealed an unlawful late-term abortion.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Abortion is legal in Kansas after a doctor certifies the baby is not viable. In order to perform a late-term (post-viability) abortion, Kansas law requires that two doctors certify the abortion is necessary for the mother’s mental or physical health. The charges allege that Planned Parenthood did not appropriately follow these laws and keep accurate documentation about the doctors’ findings.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Is it a leap to think the Kansas charges are accurate? After several other instances of failing to follow laws and regulations, Planned Parenthood’s reputation is stained. It claims to have medical standards in place at its clinics, but Planned Parenthood refuses to reveal any information to you. The American people should insist that Planned Parenthood precisely follow all laws and regulations.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Instead of letting Planned Parenthood sweep the Kansas criminal charges away, it should come to court and defend itself. Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri is innocent until proven guilty, but the Johnson County district attorney should have the chance to prove his case. District attorneys around the country should be encouraged by this example and begin their own investigations to hold Planned Parenthood accountable.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Andrew Flusche is the staff attorney at American Life League.

Headlines include:</center><center><br />
Planned Parenthood failed to report incest Planned Parenthood didn't tell, suit says Planned Parenthood concealing crimes? Even the Wednesday STOPP Report has included items about this scandal in the past couple of issues.</center><center>We decided to devote the entire issue of this week’s Wednesday STOPP Report to bring you breaking information on this important subject.</center><center>A history of Planned Parenthood’s illegal activity</center><center>There is no way of telling definitively how long Planned Parenthood has been protecting rapists. But here is just a sampling of the events pulled from American Life League’s archives:</center><center><br />
Arizona In 1998, a 12-year-old girl in Glendale, Arizona, who was raped by her foster brother, had an abortion at Planned Parenthood and PP never reported the rape to authorities. Finally, when the same girl went to Planned Parenthood six months later for another abortion, PP did notify authorities and the foster brother was arrested and convicted. The girl sued Planned Parenthood for failing to report the rape the first time and a judge ruled that PP was negligent for not initially reporting the rape. Court documents report the girl reached a settlement in the case.</center><center><br />
California In 1999, an 11-year-old girl in California went to Planned Parenthood of the Golden Gate. She told Planned Parenthood that she had been raped, but asked PP not to tell anyone, including her parents. Of course, the law is clear; regardless of the girl’s desires, when an 11-year-old is raped, there are mandatory reporting requirements. In December of 2005 Planned Parenthood of the Golden Gate featured a letter from the girl on its website. The girl wrote in praise of Planned Parenthood for helping her keep her rape secret. After American Life League exposed this letter and publicly denounced Planned Parenthood’s inaction the letter was immediately taken down. (However, the letter can still be found on the internet archive.)</center><center><br />
Ohio In November 2004 a 16-year-old-girl was brought to a Planned Parenthood abortion facility in Cincinnati and forced to have an abortion by her father. The girl says she told the Planned Parenthood employee that her father was forcing her to have sex. Planned Parenthood did not report the abuse and the father continued to rape the girl for another year and a half. On May 9, 2007 the girl filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio for refusing to report the rape. The same Planned Parenthood affiliate is also being sued for not reporting the rape of a 14-year-old girl by her soccer coach.</center><center><br />
Connecticut A 22-year-old man was arrested this month in New London, Connecticut for raping a 14-year-old girl and getting her pregnant three times in six months. Newspaper reports say it was the girl’s mother that alerted authorities, not the abortion facility. Although newspaper accounts do not identify the abortion facility involved, Mark Crutcher of Life Dynamics in Denton, Texas told the Wednesday STOPP Report that he has a copy of the police reports and it was a Planned Parenthood abortion facility in Norwich, Connecticut.</center><center>Life Dynamics’ important work</center><center>Mark Crutcher has been at the forefront in calling attention to the outrageous activities of Planned Parenthood in protecting those who prey on our children.</center><center>In 2002, he conducted an undercover investigation to determine how widespread the practice of Planned Parenthood protecting child predators is. He had a young woman, posing as a 13-year-old girl, call over 800 Planned Parenthood and National Abortion Federation facilities across the country, telling the clinic personnel that her 22-year-old boyfriend got her pregnant and asking how she could get an abortion without getting her boyfriend in trouble.</center><center>In all 50 states clinic workers are required by law to report known sexual activity between a 13-year-old and an adult, yet the Life Dynamics investigation found that 91 percent of the time, Planned Parenthood advised the girl on how to protect the child predator.</center><center>Planned Parenthood tries to intimidate young student reporter</center><center>As Lila Rose, a student at UCLA, heard about all these accusations against Planned Parenthood, she decided to conduct her own undercover investigation of Planned Parenthood in her community. On several occasions she visited various abortion clinics posing as a 15 year old who, she told clinic staff, was impregnated by her 23-year-old boyfriend. Her conversations with the staff were recorded by a video camera that she concealed in her bag.</center><center>Once again, Planned Parenthood staff tried to help her cover up what was described as a case of statutory rape. Under California law, PP was required to report her sexual activity if she was 15, but would not have to report it if she was 16. In one such recording, a Planned Parenthood employee can be heard instructing Rose to “say you are 16,” and then instructed her to lie on the forms: “Just figure out a birth date that works. And I don't know anything."</center><center>When Planned Parenthood was confronted in public with this taped violation of California law, its response was to attack Lila. Shortly after the videos and articles exposing Planned Parenthood became public Planned, Parenthood threatened legal action against her. According to California law it is illegal to record people unless all members being taped are aware of it. In compliance with the law, Rose has handed over the videos to Planned Parenthood and has removed them from the internet.</center><center>Incredibly, Planned Parenthood in California disregards the laws that protect minors, but insists on adherence to laws that protect Planned Parenthood. Obviously, its priorities are all messed up.</center><center>What can you do?</center><center>We believe that this entire subject will be key in the eventual destruction of Planned Parenthood. All of us who fight Planned Parenthood rightly emphasize the huge numbers of children it kills and the way it steals the souls of our teens. But its protection of child predators is something that surpasses both of the others in terms of encouraging people to oppose Planned Parenthood.</center><center>Just this week, American Life League’s Rock for Life Ventura chapter was outside a Planned Parenthood abortion facility in Los Angeles. The members report that even avidly pro-abortion individuals are upset with Planned Parenthood about its protection of child predators.</center><center>If we focus on this issue, we can hasten the demise of Planned Parenthood. Here are some of the things we encourage you to do:</center><center><br />
FOCUS – While maintaining all your ongoing efforts against Planned Parenthood, every organization fighting PP should identify one person who will focus on the child predator issue. KNOW – Get the background information on this whole effort at Child Predators and be prepared to answer questions. Your organization should also know the mandatory reporting laws in your state. Every state has them. RESEARCH – Find out about the Planned Parenthood facilities in your area. How many customers under the age of 15 does it claim to have? How many reports has it filed with the authorities about the sexual activities of these customers? If you need help getting this information, just send us an e-mail. Put “researcher” in the subject line and we will get you in touch with a professional researcher who has already helped a number of groups get this data. FUNDING – Find out if your local PP clinic gets funds from Title X or other government programs. All these programs require that PP adhere to all state mandatory reporting rules. If PP is not reporting, it will not only lose all future funds, but it will have to pay back past funds received. TAKE ACTION – Based on everything you find out, you should take action to bring Planned Parenthood to justice. Among the things you should do: Document your findings in a report that can be given out to interested people. Educate your local community through press releases, press conferences, letters to the editor and fliers. American Life League has a one-page flier that you can download. You can make copies and distribute them. You can even run the flier as an ad in your local newspapers (including the popular “shoppers” news). Ask your local district attorney, in light of the growing evidence around the country of Planned Parenthood’s involvement in protecting rapists, to launch an investigation of your local Planned Parenthood to ensure it is properly reporting. Ask the government agencies that are funding Planned Parenthood to conduct a thorough audit of your local Planned Parenthood to ensure it is complying with all mandatory reporting requirements. If your local Planned Parenthood clinic receives Title X funding (you can see the list of Title X recipients by state), ask your elected members of Congress to request the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct an audit. Inform parents in your area that, if they find out their under-age children are receiving contraceptives or abortions at Planned Parenthood, they may be able to file a report. Send them to Parental Alert. American Life League will be working closely with Life Dynamics on this effort and we encourage everyone who is serious about fighting Planned Parenthood to take action in your local communities.</center><center><br />

The man was not a Nazi or Klansman; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Sanger's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists. One, Lothrop Stoddard, was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy. Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as "scientific" and "humanitarian." And Dr. Harry Laughlin, another Sanger associate and board member for her group, spoke of purifying America's human "breeding stock" and purging America's "bad strains." These "strains" included the "shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South."</p><p>Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as "unfit," a plan she said would be the "salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were "irresponsible and reckless," among whom she included those " whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers." She further contended that "there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped." That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered "unfit" cannot be easily refuted.</p><p>While Planned Parenthood's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements, history definitively says otherwise. The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review, which Sanger founded in 1917. She published such articles as "Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics" (June 1920), "The Eugenic Conscience" (February 1921), "The purpose of Eugenics" (December 1924), "Birth Control and Positive Eugenics" (July 1925), "Birth Control: The True Eugenics" (August 1928), and many others.</p><p>These eugenic and racial origins are hardly what most people associate with the modern Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), which gave its Margaret Sanger award to the late Dr. Martin Luther King in 1966, and whose current president, Faye Wattleton, is black, a former nurse, and attractive.</p><p>Though once a social pariah group, routinely castigated by religious and government leaders, the PPFA is now an established, high-profile, well-funded organization with ample organizational and ideological support in high places of American society and government. Its statistics are accepted by major media and public health officials as "gospel"; its full-page ads appear in major newspapers; its spokespeople are called upon to give authoritative analyses of what America's family policies should be and to prescribe official answers that congressmen, state legislator and Supreme Court justiices all accept as "social orthodoxy."</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Blaming Families</font></p><p>Sanger's obsession with eugenics can be traced back to her own family. One of 11 children, she wrote in the autobiographical book, My Fight for Birth Control, that "I associated poverty, toil, unemployment, drunkenness, cruelty, quarreling, fighting, debts, jails with large families." Just as important was the impression in her childhood of an inferior family status, exacerbated by the iconoclastic, "free-thinking" views of her father, whose "anti-Catholic attitudes did not make for his popularity" in a predominantly Irish community.</p><p>The fact that the wealthy families in her hometown of Corning, N.Y., had relatively few children, Sanger took as prima facie evidence of the impoverishing effect of larger families. The personal impact of this belief was heightened 1899, at the age of 48. Sanger was convinced that the "ordeals of motherhood" had caused the death of her mother. The lingering consumption (tuberculosis) that took her mother's life visited Sanger at the birth of her own first child on Nov. 18, 1905. The diagnosis forced her to seek refuge in the Adirondacks to strengthen her for the impending birth. Despite the precautions, the birth of baby Grant was "agonizing," the mere memory of which Sanger described as "mental torture" more than 25 years later. She once described the experience as a factor "to be reckoned with" in her zealous campaign for birth control.</p><p>From the beginning, Sanger advocacy of sex education reflected her interest in population control and birth prevention among the "unfit." Her first handbook, published for adolescents in 1915 and entitled, What Every Boy and Girl Should Know, featured a jarring afterword:</p><p>It is a vicious cycle; ignorance breeds poverty and poverty breeds ignorance. There is only one cure for both, and that is to stoop breeding these things. Stop bringing to birth children whose inheritance cannot be one of health or intelligence. Stop bringing into the world children whose parents cannot provide for them.</p><p>To Sanger, the ebbing away of moral and religious codes over sexual conduct was a natural consequence of the worthlessness of such codes in the individual's search for self-fulfillment. "Instead of laying down hard and fast rules of sexual conduct," Sanger wrote in her 1922 book Pivot of Civilization, "sex can be rendered effective and valuable only as it meets and satisfies the interests and demands of the pupil himself." Her attitude is appropriately described as libertinism, but sex knowledge was not the same as individual liberty, as her writings on procreation emphasized.</p><p>The second edition of Sanger's life story, An Autobiography, appeared in 1938. There Sanger described her first cross-country lecture tour in 1916. Her standard speech asserted seven conditions of life that "mandated" the use of birth control: the third was "when parents, though normal, had subnormal children"; the fourth, "when husband and wife were adolescent"; the fifth, "when the earning capacity of the father was inadequate." No right existed to exercise sex knowledge to advance procreation. Sanger described the fact that "anyone, no matter how ignorant, how diseased mentally or physically, how lacking in all knowledge of children, seemed to consider he or she had the right to become a parent."</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Religious Bigotry</font></p><p>In the 1910's and 1920's, the entire social order–religion, law, politics, medicine, and the media–was arrayed against the idea and practice of birth control. This opposition began in 1873 when an overwhelmingly Protestant Congress passed, and a Protestant president signed into law, a bill that became known as the Comstock Law, named after its main proponent, Anthony Comstock. The U.S. Congress classified obscene writing, along with drugs, and devices and articles that prevented conception or caused abortion, under the same net of criminality and forbade their importation or mailing.</p><p>Sanger set out to have such legislation abolished or amended. Her initial efforts were directed at the Congress with the opening of a Washington, D.C., office of her American Birth Control League in 1926. Sanger wanted to amend section 211 of the U.S. criminal code to allow the interstate shipment and mailing of contraceptives among physicians, druggists and drug manufacturers.</p><p>During January and February of 1926, Sanger and her co-workers personally interviewed 40 senators and 14 representatives. None agreed to introduce a bill to amend the Comstock Act. Fresh from this unanimous rejection, Sanger issued an update to her followers: Everywhere there is general acceptance of the idea, except in religious circles. . .The National Catholic Welfare Council [sic] (NCWC) has a special legislative committee organized to block and defeat our legislation. They frankly state that they intend to legislate for non-Catholics according to the dictates of the church.</p><p>There was no such committee. But 20 non-Catholic lay or religious organizations joined NCWC in opposition to amending the Comstock Act. This was not the first time, nor was it to be the last, that Sanger sought to stir up sectarian strife by blaming Catholics for her legislative failures. Catholic-bashing was a standard tactic (one that Planned Parenthood still finds useful to this day), although other Christian groups now also come in for criticism.</p><p>Eight years later, in 1934, Sanger went to Congress again. Reporting on the first day of the hearings, the New York Times noted: ... the almost solidly Catholic opposition to the measure. This is now, according to Margaret Sanger. . . the only organized opposition to the proposal.</p><p>Sanger wrote a letter to her "Friends, Co-workers, and Endorsers" that portrayed the opposing testimony as the work of Catholics determined ... not to present facts to the committee but to intimidate them by showing a Catholic block of voters who (though in the minority in the United States) want to dictate to the majority of non-Catholics as directed from the Vatican in social and moral legislation ... American men and women, are we going to allow this insulting arrogance to bluff the American people?</p><p>For Sanger, the proper attitude toward her religious critics featured character assassination, personal vilification and old-fashioned bigotry. Her Birth Control Review printed an article that noted: "Today by the Roman Catholic clergy and their allies . . . Public opinion in America, I fear, is too willing to condone in the officials of the Roman Catholic Church what it condemns in the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>A favorite Catholic-baiter of Sanger's was Norman E. Himes, who contributed articles to Sanger's journal. Himes claimed there were genetic differences between Catholics and non-Catholics.</p><p>Are Catholic stocks . . . genetically inferior to such non-Catholic libertarian stocks and Unitarians and Universal . . . Freethinkers? Inferior to non-Catholics in general? . . . my guess is that the answer will someday be made in the affirmative. . . and if the supposed differentials in net productivity are also genuine, the situation is anti-social, perhaps gravely so.</p><p>Sanger sought to isolate Catholics by creating a schism between them and Protestants, who had held parallel views of birth control and abortion for centuries. She welcomed a report from a majority of the Committee on Marriage and the Home of the General Council of Churches (later the National Council of Churches) advocating birth control. This committee was composed largely of social elite Protestants, including Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. A number of Protestant church bodies publicly repudiated the committee's endorsement.</p><p>The Rev. Worth Tippy, council executive secretary and author of the report, told Sanger in April 1931 that: ... the statement on Moral Aspects of Birth Control has aroused more opposition within the Protestant churches than we expected. Under the circumstances, and since we plan to carry on a steady work for liberalizing laws and to stimulate the establishment of clinics, it is necessary that we make good these losses and also increase our resources.Could you help me quietly by giving me the names of people of means who are interested in the birth control movement and might help us if I wrote them.</p><p>Sanger immediately wrote Tippy that she would be "glad to select names of persons from our lists whom I think might be able to subscribe." Tippy replied to Sanger a week later, offering to give her some names for fund raising and thanking her for the offer of "names of people who are able to contribute to generous causes and who are favorable to birth control." He also related that they had expected some reaction from the "fundamentalist groups," but nothing like what had happened.</p><p>Protestants repeatedly stated their unity with Catholics in opposing Planned Parenthood's initiatives. During Sanger's attempts to reform New York state law, another Protestant stood with Catholics. The Rev. John R. Straton, Pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church of New York City, said: "This bill is subversive of the human family . . . It is revolting, monstrous, against God's word and contradicts American traditions."</p><p>Sanger's attack on Catholics appeared to be an attempt to divert attention from the class politics of Planned Parenthood. The Rev. John A. Ryan wrote: ... their main objective is to increase the practice of birth-prevention among the poor . . . It is said that the present birth-prevention movement is to some extent financed by wealthy, albeit philanthropic persons. As far as I am aware , none of these is conspicuous in the movement for economic justice. None of them is crying out for a scale of wages which would enable workers to take care of a normal number of children.</p><p>Sanger's sexual license was another motivation for her Anti-Catholic sniping. A Sanger biographer, David M. Kennedy, said her primary goal was to "increase the quantity and quality of sexual relationships." The birth control movement, she said, freed the mind from "sexual prejudice and taboo, by demanding the frankest and most unflinching re-examination of sex in its relation to human nature and the basis of human society.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Sannger's Gamble</font></p><p>It was in 1939 that Sanger's larger vision for dealing with the reproductive practices of black Americans emerged. After the January 1939 merger of her Clinical Research Bureau and the ABCL to form the Birth Control Federation of America, Dr. Clarence J. Gamble was selected to become the BCFA regional director for the South. Dr. Gamble, of the soap-manufacturing Procter and Gamble company, was no newcomer to Sanger's organization. He had previously served as director at large to the predecessor ABCL.</p><p>Gamble lost no time and drew up a memorandum in November 1939 entitled "Suggestion for Negro Project." Acknowledging that black leaders might regard birth control as an extermination plot, he suggested that black leaders be place in positions where it would appear that they were in chargeÑas it was at an Atlanta conference.</p><p>It is evident from the rest of the memo that Gamble conceived the project almost as a traveling road show. A charismatic black minister was to start a revival, with "contributions" to come from other local cooperating ministers. A "colored nurse" would follow, supported by a subsidized "colored doctor." Gamble even suggested that music might be a useful lure to bring the prospects to a meeting.</p><p>Sanger answered Gamble on Dec. 10. 1939, agreeing with the assessment. She wrote: "We do not want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten that idea out if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members." In 1940, money for two "Negro Project" demonstration programs in southern states was donated by advertising magnate Albert D. Lasker and his wife, Mary.</p><p>Birth control was presented both as an economic betterment vehicle and as a health measure that could lower the incidence of infant mortality. At the 1942 BCFA annual meeting, BCFA Negro Council board member Dr. Dorothy B. Ferebee–a cum laude graduate of Tufts and also president of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation's largest black sorority–addressed the delegates regarding Planned Parenthood's minority outreach efforts&#160;: With the Negro group some of the most difficult obstacles . . . to overcome are: (1) the concept that when birth control is proposed to them, it is motivated by a clever bit of machination to persuade them to commit race suicide; (2) the so-called "husband rejection" . . . (3) the fact that birth control is confused with abortion, and (4) the belief that is inherently immoral. However, as formidable as these objections may seem, when thrown against the total picture of the awareness on the part of the Negro leaders of the improved condition under Planned Parenthood, or the genuine interest and eagerness of the families themselves to secure the services which will give them a fair chance for health and happiness, the obstacles to the program are greatly outweighed.</p><p>Birth control as an economic improvement measure had some appeal to those lowest on the income ladder. In the black Chicago Defender for Jan. 10, 1942, a long three-column women's interest article discussed the endorsement of the Sanger program by prominent black women. There were at lease six express references, such as the following example, to birth control as a remedy for economic woes:" . . . it raises the standard of living by enabling parents to adjust the family size to the family income." Readers were also told that birth control" . . . is no operation. It is no abortion. Abortion kills life after it has begun. . . Birth Control is neither harmful nor immoral."</p><p>But the moral stumbling block could only be surmounted by Afro-American religious leaders, so black ministers were solicited. Florence Rose, long-time Sanger secretary, prepared an activities report during March 1942 detailing the progress of the "Negro Project." She recounted a recent meeting with a Planned Parenthood Negro Division board member, Bishop David H. Sims (African Methodist Episcopal Church), who appreciated Planned Parenthood's recognition of the extent of black opposition to birth control and its efforts to build up support among black leaders. He offered whatever assistance he could give.</p><p>Bishop Sims offered to begin the "softening process" among the representatives of different Negro denominations attending the monthly meetings of the Federal Council of Churches and its Division of Race Relations.</p><p>These and other efforts paid off handsomely after World War II. By 1949, virtually the entire black leadership network of religious, social, professional, and academic organizations had endorsed Planned Parenthood's program.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">National Scandal</font></p><p>More than a decade later, Planned Parenthood continued targeting minority communities, but without much success.</p><p>In 1940, nonwhite women aged 18 to 19 experienced 61 births per 1,000 unmarried women. In 1968, the corresponding figure was 112 per 1,000, a 100 percent jump. What other factor could account for the increased rate of sexual activity than wider access to birth control, with its promise of sex without tears and consequences?</p><p>Alan Guttmacher, then president of Planned Parenthood, was desperate to show policy-makers that birth control would produce a situation whereby "minority groups who constantly outbreed the majority will no longer persist in doing so. . . "</p><p>Despite claims that racial or ethnic groups were not being "targeted," American blacks, among whose ranks a greater proportion of the poor were numbered, received a high priority in Planned Parenthood's nationwide efforts. Donald B. Strauss, chairman of Planned ParenthoodÑWorld Population, urged the 1964 Democratic national Convention to liberalize the party's stated policies on birth control, and to adopt domestic and foreign policy platform resolutions to conform with long-sought San gerite goals: [While almost one-fourth of nonwhite parents have four or more children under 18 living with them, only 8% of the white couples have that many children living at home. For the Negro parent in particular, the denial of access to family planning professional guidance forecloses one more avenue to family advancement and well-being..</p><p>Unwanted children would not get the job training and educational skills they needed to compete in a shrinking labor market; moreover, unwanted children are a product and a cause of poverty.</p><p>Surveying the "successes" of tax-subsidized birth control programs, Guttmacher noted in 1970 that "[Birth control services are proliferating in areas adjacent to concentrations of black population." (In the 1980's, targeting the inner-city black communities for school based sex clinics became more sensitive than expected.)</p><p>Guttmacher thought that as long as the birth rate continued to fall or remained at a low level, Planned Parenthood should certainly be introduced before family size by coercion is attempted."</p><p>Reaching this goal, he thought, would best be accomplished by having groups other than the PPFA preach the doctrine of a normative 2.1-child family, as doing this would offend Planned Parenthood's minority clients. He suggested that family size would decrease if abortion were liberalized nationwide and received government support. In this prediction he was right on target.</p><p>But Guttmacher did not completely reject forced population control: Predicting 20 critical years ahead in the struggle to control the population explosion, Dr. Alan Guttmacher, president of Planned parenthoodÑWorld Population, continues to urge the use of all voluntary means to hold down on the world birthrate. But he foresees the possibility that eventual coercion may become necessary, particularly in areas where the pressure is greatest, possibly India and China. "Each country," he says, "will have to decide its own form of coercion, and determine when and how it should be employed. At Present, the means are compulsory sterilization and compulsory abortion. Perhaps some day a way of enforcing compulsory birth control will be feasible.</p><p>Coerced abortion is already practiced in China, with the International Planned Parenthood Federation's approval.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Extreme Irony</font></p><p>Despite its past, Planned Parenthood has managed to present the image of toleration and minority participation through the vehicle of its divorced, telegenic, African American president, Ms. Faye Wattleton, appointed titular head of the PPFA in 1978, a post she still holds. Though paid in the six-figure range, she has impeccable minority credentials that would have fit the public relations criteria for both Margaret Sanger and Dr. Clarence Gamble.</p><p>Wattleton's PPFA biography touts her as a friend of the "Poor and the young"; a nurse at Harlem Hospital; and the recipient of the 1989 Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Humanitarian Award and the World Institute of Black Communicators' 1986 Excellence in Black Communications Award. It further states she was featured in a national photography exhibit, "I Dream A World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America"; interviewed in Ebony; and was the cover story in Black Enterprise magazine. (Time published a profile of Wattleton in 1990 entitled "Nothing Less Than Perfect.")</p><p>Her ideological orientation has received certification in the form of the Better World Society's 1989 Population Model, the 1986 American Humanist Award, and others. But surely, the spectacle of the Congressional Black Caucus awarding its humanitarian award to the black woman who presides over the organization that has hastened and justified the death of almost eight million black children since 1973 and facilitates the demise of the black family is ironic in the extreme.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="new" title="Image:41GSC1HD4YLAA240.jpg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=41GSC1HD4YLAA240.jpg"><img width="240" height="240" alt="" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/41GSC1HD4YLAA240.jpg" /></a></p><p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"><strong>Killer Angel</strong> book by George Grant Bio of Margaret Sanger</font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://freebooks.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/39ba_47e.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://freebooks.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/39ba_47e.htm">http://freebooks.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/39ba_47e.htm</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p>In his book, Killer Angel, George Grant says: "Myths, according to theologian J. l. packer, are Ôstories made up to sanctify social patterns.' They are lies, carefully designed to reinforce a particular philosophy or morality within a culture. They are instruments of manipulation and control.</p><p>Killer Angel tells the real story behind one of the biggest myths that controls our culture todayÑthe life and legacy of Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood. Grant exposes "the Big Lie" perpetuated by Sanger's followers and the organization she started.</p><p>Through detailed research and concise writing, Grant unveils Sanger's true character and ideology, which included blatant racism, revolutionary socialism, sexual perversion and insatiable avarice. Grant includes direct quotes from sources such as Sanger's Birth Control Review to support his findings. His biography spans Sanger's disturbed and unhappy upbringingÑwhich Sanger said contributed to her agitation and bitterness later in lifeÑto her eventual fixation with drugs, alcohol and the occult.</p><p>Particularly shocking was Sanger's involvement in the Eugenics movement. Grant says: "[Sanger] was thoroughly convinced that the Ôinferior races' were in fact Ôhuman weeds' and a Ômenace to civilization.' . . . [S]he was a true believer, not simply someone who assimilated the jargon of the timesÑas Planned Parenthood officials would have us believe."</p><p>Sanger died September 6, 1966, a week before her eighty-seventh birthday. Grant says: "[She] had nearly fulfilled her early boast that she would spend every last penny of Slee's [her second husband] fortune. In the process, though, she had lost everything else: love, happiness, satisfaction, fulfillment, family, and friends. In the end, her struggle was her naught."</p><p>The truth uncovered in grant's book has proven to be a threat to those who follow the cult of&#160;:Planned Parenthood. In fact, Killer Angel was recently banned from a public library in Toledo, Ohio. A library manager stated in a letter that, "The author's political and social agenda, which is strongly expoused throughout the book, is not appropriate even in a critical biography of its subject."</p><p>In response, Grant pointed out that "The question at hand is whether librarians should be making subjective judgments about my political beliefs and the beliefs of other authors."</p><p>By censoring Killer Angel, the library appears to be violating its own policies, which state that, "the Library collection shall include representative materials of all races and nationalities, and all political, religious, economic and social views." Except Christian views, apparently.</p><p>While the Toledo public library may not be interested in the information put forth in Grant's book, pro-lifers will find this biography useful and enlightening. It serves as a powerful tool in dispelling the myths surrounding a womanÑconsidered a heroine by manyÑwho began an organization that is responsible for the deaths of millions of unborn children.</p><p>Grant states that, "Margaret SangerÑand her heirs at Planned Parenthood . . . have thus far been able to parlay the deception into a substantial empire. But now the truth must be told. The illusion must be exposed." Killer Angel does an outstanding job in doing that. Sanger's Legacy is Reproductive Freedom and Racism</p><p>Despite Margaret Sanger's contributions to birth control and hence women's freedom and empowerment, her legacy is diminished by her sympathies with eugenics. This writer says that, like many modern feminists, Sanger ignored class and race.</p><p>(WOMENSENEWS)--Margaret Sanger opened the nation's first birth control clinic in 1916. For the rest of her life she worked to establish a woman's right to control her body and to decide when or whether to have a child. In 1921, she founded the American Birth Control league, the forerunner of Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Her impact on contemporary society is tremendous. Enabling women to control their fertility and giving them access to contraception, as advocated by Sanger, makes it possible for women to have a broader set of life options, especially in the areas of education and employment, than if their lives are dominated by unrelieved childbearing.</p><p>A recent reminder of Sanger's impact on our society came when the Equal employment Opportunity Commission found that it is illegal sex discrimination to exclude prescription contraceptives from an otherwise comprehensive health benefits plan. Sanger's efforts to provide access to contraception are at the foundation of decisions to provide equal access to prescription contraceptives and other prescriptions.</p><p>Still, especially with the Bush administration, activists will have to fight to maintain access to contraception and to abortion. In April, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would establish criminal penalties for harming a fetus during the commission of a crime. While proponents of the bill say it does not include abortion, some see fetal protection legislation as an attempt to undermine abortion rights. The passage of this legislation is a reminder that the rights Margaret Sanger worked so hard to establish are tenuous rights that many would challenge.</p><p>For all her positive influence, I see Sanger as a tarnished heroine whose embrace of the eugenics movement showed racial insensitivity, at best. From her associates, as well as from some of the articles that were published in Sanger's magazine, the Birth Control review, it is possible to conclude that "racially insensitive" is too mild a description. Indeed, some of her statements, taken in or out of context, are simply racist. And she never rebuked eugenicists who believed in improving the hereditary qualities of a race or breed by controlling mating in order to eliminate "undesirable" characteristics and promote "desirable" traits.</p><hr /><p><font size="4">Sanger: We Must Limit the Over-Fertility of Mentally, Physically Defective</font></p><p>"Our failure to segregate morons who are increasing and multiplying . . . demonstrates our foolhardy and extravagant sentimentalism," she wrote in the recently republished "The Pivot of Civilization." This book, written in 1922, was published at a time when scientific racism had been used to assert black inferiority. Who determines who is a moron? How would these morons be segregated? The ramifications of such statements are bone chilling.</p><p>In a 1921 article in the Birth Control Review, Sanger wrote, "The most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective." Reviewers of one of her 1919 articles interpreted her objectives as "More children from the fit, less from the unfit." Again, the question of who decides fitness is important, and it was an issue that Sanger only partly addressed. "The undeniably feebleminded should indeed, not only be discouraged but prevented from propagating their kind," she wrote.</p><p>Sanger advocated the mandatory sterilization of the insane and feebleminded." Although this does not diminish her legacy as the key force in the birth control movement, it raises questions much like those now being raised about our nation's slaveholding founders. How do we judge historical figures? How are their contributions placed in context?</p><p>It is easy to see why there is some antipathy toward Sanger among people of color, considering that, given our nation's history, we are the people most frequently described as "unfit" and "feebleminded."</p><p>Many African American women have been subject to nonconsensual forced sterilization. Some did not even know that they were sterilized until they tried, unsuccessfully, to have children. In 1973, Essence Magazine published an expose of forced sterilization practices in the rural South, where racist physicians felt they were performing a service by sterilizing black women without telling them. While one cannot blame Margaret Sanger for the actions of these physician, one can certainly see why Sanger's words are especially repugnant in a racial context.</p><p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has been protective of Margaret Sanger's reputation and defensive of allegations that she was a racist. They correctly point out that many of the attacks on Sanger come from anti-choice activists who have an interest in distorting both Sanger's work and that of Planned Parenthood. While it is understandable that Planned Parenthood would be protective of their founder's reputation, it cannot ignore the fact that Sanger edited the Birth Control review from its inception until 1929. Under her leadership, the magazine featured articles that embraced the eugenicist position. If Sanger were as anti-eugenics as Planned Parenthood says she was, she would not have printed as many articles sympathetic to eugenics as she did.</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4">Like Many Modern Feminists, Sanger Ignored Race and Class</font></strong></p><p>Would the NAACP's house organ, Crisis Magazine, print articles by members of the Ku Klux Klan? Would Planned Parenthood publish articles penned by fetal protectionist South Carolina republican Lindsey Graham?</p><p>The articled published in the Birth Control Review showed Sanger's empathy with some eugenicist views. Margaret Sanger worked closely with W. E. B. DuBois on her "Negro Project," an effort to expose Southern black women to birth control. Mary McLeod Bethune and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. were also involved in the effort. Much later, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. accepted an award from Planned Parenthood and complimented the organization's efforts. It is entirely possible that Sanger Ôs views evolved over time. Certainly, by the late 1940s, she spoke about ways to solve the "Negro problem" in the United States. This evolution, however commendable, does not eradicate the impact of her earlier statements.</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4">What, then, is Sanger's legacy?</font></strong></p><p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has grown to an organization with 129 affiliates. It operates 875 health centers and serves about 5 million women each year. Planned Parenthood has been a leader in the fight for women's right to choose and in providing access to affordable reproductive health care for a cross-section of women. Planned Parenthood has not supported forced sterilization or restricted immigration and has gently rejected the most extreme of Sanger's views.</p><p>In many ways, Sanger is no different from contemporary feminists who, after making the customary acknowledgement of issues dealing with race and class, return to analysis that focuses exclusively on gender. These are the feminists who feel that women should come together around "women's issues" and battle out our differences later. In failing to acknowledge differences and the differential impact of a set of policies, these feminists make it difficult for women to come together.</p><p>Sanger published the Birth Control Review at the same time that black men, returning from World War I, were lynched in uniform. That she did not see the harm in embracing exclusionary jargon about sterilization and immigration suggests that she was, at best, socially myopic.</p><p>That's reason enough to suggest that her leadership was flawed and her legacy crippled by her insensitivity.</p><p><br /><strong>Order Pastor Childress' new book "No Shepherd's Cry"</strong></p><p>L.E.A.R.N.

To suggest that Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist is to raise the ire of many of the present-day leaders of Planned Parenthood and other anti-life organizations. However, the facts do speak for themselves.</p><p>For example, throughout the pages of the Birth Control Review, Mrs. Sanger's journal, there are countless quotes which not only suggest that she favored eugenics, but that she provided a forum to those who wished to spread their fear of human life, when that life was conceived by someone other than a member of society's elite.</p><p>This brochure is devoted to familiarizing you with the most outrageous of the statements to which Mrs. Sanger gave credence, as well as to a few of her own. Since books have been written about her, it is not necessary for us to go into her sordid background at length, but simply to give you a taste of the hypocrisy which has led so many people into the web Planned Parenthood weaves, even today. It is a web that distorts, misrepresents and ultimately cheapens the beautiful gift of human sexuality which God gives to each and every person at conception.</p><p><em><strong>Who Was Margaret Sanger?</strong></em></p><p>Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was an adulteress, racist and bigot, a supporter of Hitler's Nazi party, and a believer in eugenics - the purification of a particular race of people by selective breeding. Her magazines and journals were filled with writings and articles by well-known eugenicists and members of Hitler's Third Reich.</p><p><em><strong>Marriage:</strong></em></p><p>Sanger made every effort to promote philosophies which would assist the state in controlling the size of families. However, with regard to her own family, her first husband William Sanger, her children, and her subsequent divorce, she wrote in her 1931 book, My Fight for Birth Control:</p><p>"'My first marriage failed, not because of love, romance, lack of wealth, respect or any such qualities which are supposed to be lacking in broken ties, because the interest of each widened beyond that of the other". "From the deep waters into which I had been swept by the current of events it was impossible to return to the shallow pool of domesticity'"</p><p>The wife who is able to stay at home and care for her family because she wants to is characterized by Sanger as someone who is simply drowning in a "shallow pool of domesticity," an attitude con-sistently promulgated in today's society by the feminist movement and those who have relegated motherhood to the lowest level of achievement.</p><p><em><strong>Adultery:</strong></em></p><p>After a failed trial marriage at 18, she married William Sanger in 1902 and soon engaged in extramarital affairs while encouraging her husband to do the same. She pronounced the marriage bed to be "the most degenerating influence in the social order" and advocated a "voluntary association" between sexual partners.</p><p>At the beginning of her "mission" to bring birth control to America, around 1912, she saw birth control as a tool in the class struggle and was clearly on the side of the poor.</p><p>However, her involvement with well-known socialists and eugenicists of the day (Eugene Debs, Emma Goldman, Will Durant, Clarence Darrow, and Ellen Key) changed her mind completely. Over a period of eight years she began to turn the birth control movement against the very people she had set out to help.</p><p><em><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong></em></p><p>Mrs. Sanger, who did not have faith in God, and detested all those who did, wrote:</p><p>"I never liked to look at Jesus on the Cross. I could not see any good it did to keep looking at him. We could not help him, as he had been crucified long ago."</p><p>To know Christ and to appreciate His suffering, death and resurrection for each and every one of us would obviously have been foreign to Mrs. Sanger. To her, after all, many of those created in the image and likeness of God were simply less than human.</p><p><em><strong>The Pivot of Civilization:</strong></em></p><p>Instead of helping the poor, she considered them slum dwellers (particularly Blacks, Hispanics, and Jewish immigrants) who would soon overrun the boundaries of their slums, contaminating the better elements of society with their diseases and inferior genes.</p><p>Throughout the 200+ pages of this book Sanger called for the elimination of "human weeds," for the cessation of charity, for the segregation of "morons, misfits, and maladjusted," and for the sterilization of "genetically inferior races."[4] In this same book she argued that organized attempts to help the poor were the "surest sign that our civilization has bred, is breeding, and is perpetuating . . . defectives, delinquents, and dependents."[5] She called for coercive sterilization, mandatory segregation, and rehabilitative concentration camps for all inferior Blacks, Hispanics, poor Whites, and Catholics.</p><p>Sanger's brand of prejudice was based on what author John L. Keller labels "Scientific Racism," the belief that as long as people demonstrated "a good quality gene pool" they were esteemed a valuable part of society. On the other hand, if a group, including Whites, demonstrated undesirable traits, their fertility had to be curbed along with other "inferiors and undesirables."</p><p>George Grant stated in Grand Illusions: "In her book Women and the New Race she asserted that the 'most merciful thing a large family can do to one of its infant members is to kill it.'"</p><p><em><strong>Minorities:</strong></em></p><p>On October 19, 1939, Sanger outlined a plan for stopping the growth of the Black community. She predicted that "the most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their rebellious members."[8] Her planning, which included being careful to make it appear that hand-picked Blacks are in control, is followed with success even today. Faye Wattleton's position as President of PPFA was testimony to that fact.</p><p><em><strong>The Birth Control Review:</strong></em></p><p>The Birth Control Review, founded by Sanger in 1917, was totally committed to the eugenics philosophy. The official editorial policy of The Review endorsed I.Q. testing, which classified Blacks, southern Europeans, and other immigrants as mentally inferior to native-born White Americans and called them a nuisance and a menace to society. In the 1920s she tried to use the results from I.Q. tests, which classified the U.S. soldier as a near moron, to back up her own findings.</p><p>Sanger truly believed these groups were a "dead weight of human waste" and "a menace to the race."</p><p><em><strong>Abortion and Birth Control:</strong></em></p><p>It was in the December, 1918, Birth Control Review that Margaret Sanger wrote perhaps the most ingenious comment of all: ". . . I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization. . ."</p><p>How do you sell the practice of contraception to a public that is totally opposed to it? In 1918, when she wrote the above, no religious denomination accepted the practice of contraception. Well, you sell it to the people by insisting that with better contraception there would be less abortion! It sounds very familiar, doesn't it?</p><p>Today, it is only the Roman Catholic Church that stands for the truth with regard to contraception, and among its members it is said that eighty percent practice contraception anyway. Would Mrs. Sanger be proud of her campaign if she could see the results we live with today - more than 50 strains of VD as well as the deadly AIDS virus?</p><p>And would she agree with current Planned Parenthood president Pamela Maraldo, who writes: "As Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders has so succinctly put it: 'We've taught our children in driver's education what to do in the front seat, and now we've got to teach them what to do in the back seat.'"</p><p>Today American youth are told that the "responsible" thing to do is use contraception, be realistic and formulate your own values as you go, and if your contraception fails, get an abortion.[13] Responsible? Mrs. Sanger would be proud.</p><p>Thus through Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood has molded the sexual ethics of the day: Sex is a natural thing for a teenager to desire and if a teenager feels that he is to be sexually active that is his decision; all society asks is that he not produce children.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><font size="4">OTHER LINKS:</font></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://dianedew.com/sanger.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://dianedew.com/sanger.htm">http://dianedew.com/sanger.htm</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://dianedew.com/black.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://dianedew.com/black.htm">http://dianedew.com/black.htm</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://www.eadshome.com/MargaretSanger.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eadshome.com/MargaretSanger.htm">http://www.eadshome.com/MargaretSanger.htm</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://blackgenocide.org/planned.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://blackgenocide.org/planned.html">http://blackgenocide.org/planned.html</a></p><p>This quote from <a class="external free" title="http://lifedynamics.com/DeathCamps/Holocaust6.cfm" rel="nofollow" href="http://lifedynamics.com/DeathCamps/Holocaust6.cfm">http://lifedynamics.com/DeathCamps/Holocaust6.cfm</a> <a class="external free" title="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/</a> birthcontrol/bio-margaret-sanger.xml collaborates her desire to enlist black ministers to further her efforts to exterminate them:</p><p>“In 1930, Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city's health and social services.

Here is an insightful article into the tragic history of a woman who created a ravenous beast, a wolf in sheep's clothing, that has devoured generations of women and children. Her name is Margaret Sanger and the infamous organization she started is known today as Planned Parenthood. Here is her tainted legacy and bloodlust heritage that has survived her passing and her eternal reward.</p><p>As you read this article, our Lord's words are quite fitting, "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them (Matthew 7:15-20)."</p><p>HER CAUSE WAS A DIRE NECESSITY</p><p>Margaret Sanger &amp; 'The New Woman'</p><p>September 2006 By Anne Barbeau Gardiner</p><p>Anne Barbeau Gardiner is a Contributing Editor of the NOR. She has published on Dryden, Milton, and Swift, as well as on Catholics of the 17th century, and is Professor Emerita of English at John Jay College of the City University of New York.</p><p>Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, saw herself as "The New Woman," one emancipated from traditional religion and morality, empowered to have sex without procreation, and able to compete publicly with men. Yet behind this facade was a soul lost in emptiness and degradation.</p><p>An atheist who scorned all hope of an afterlife, Margaret Sanger lived entirely for the here and now. Born in 1879, she married twice and cheated on both spouses. Her first husband, whom she wed in August 1902 and divorced in 1921, was the socialist Bill Sanger. With him she had three much-neglected children. While married to Bill -- and this is proven by letters and journals that survive -- she had many affairs, some lasting for years, with such men as the Editor of American Parade Walter Roberts, the well-known English sexologist Havelock Ellis, the Spanish radical Lorenzo Portet, and the English patrician Hugh de Selincourt, as well as his wife Janet. These are facts, not rumors or suspicions, since her adulteries are well documented in the definitive biography, Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America written by Ellen Chesler, who makes use of the archives in Smith College and the Library of Congress. Why did Margaret not destroy these compromising papers? Like a female Dorian Gray, she kept her scabrous self hidden away for her entire life. But perhaps she thought that was long enough and wanted to be "outed" after her death.</p><p>A rich friend from early days, Mabel Dodge, recalled that Margaret was the first woman she ever knew who openly propagandized the pleasures of the flesh "as a sacred and at the same time a scientific reality." This is a crucial point: It was Margaret's trademark to speak of sex with a combination of sentiment and science. Science here means the pseudo-science of eugenics, part of Herbert Spencer's religion of evolutionism, which was a public craze at that time. Margaret and her associates wanted to legalize not just birth control, but also forced sterilization of the "unfit," so those classes would breed less and ease the burden on rich taxpayers. In the 1920s she was subsidized by a set of wealthy people who dabbled in population control (as the ultra-rich still do today). These millionaires imagined that they were the "fit" class and that they could seize the reins from Nature and direct the evolution of the human species to a higher level. Mostly they wanted to ensure that the breeding of inferior classes would be curtailed. Angela Franks has recently published an important work, Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy, which demonstrates how deeply the founder of Planned Parenthood was implicated in eugenics and in the Spencerian faith in evolutionism.</p><p>(Side note: The local Planned Parenthood is supported by the "who's who" in Waco, TX. The rich, elite class of our community are ardent in their defense of the indefensible performed by Planned Parenthood. There is nothing new under the sun).</p><p>These two ways of looking at sex -- sacred and scientific -- would be contradictory if not for the fact that sacred here is only a smokescreen to hide the main point -- that human sex is nothing more than the crude coupling of animals. When Margaret was going around lecturing about the need for medical control of human breeding and lacing her talks with sentimental rhetoric, she was only repeating what she had learned in England in 1914 from her mentor Havelock Ellis, also an atheist. Ellis taught that sex was a matter of biology and anthropology, but it could have a spiritual dimension. A precursor of Kinsey, Ellis produced the first clinical study of homosexuals, claimed their orientation was genetic, and demanded legal protection for them. He supported co-education and sex-education for children, as well as organized feminism, and he labeled as normal even the sexual perversions of sadism and masochism. Chesler says that it is "virtually impossible to overestimate" his influence on Margaret Sanger. She imbibed his theories uncritically and formed from them the basis of her birth-control agenda. She also saw his teaching as a green light for her own misbehavior.</p><p>Later, though, when Ellis's memoirs came out posthumously in 1940, Margaret was disappointed at the romantic nostalgia with which he wrote about his marriage to Edith, a lesbian. (Part of this was the result of guilt, since his sexual infatuation with Margaret had hastened his wife's death.) Margaret complained that these memoirs "undermined the empirical scientific basis of Ellis's sex research and theory," which had been the "foundation" of "her own life and work." Here she made it perfectly clear that a "scientific" approach to sex was the groundwork of her Birth Control League, later to be called Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Margaret's second husband was Noah Slee, a multi-millionaire who was 20 years her senior and who left his wife within months of meeting Margaret. They were married in September 1922. At the time, Noah was unaware that Margaret -- even in the weeks leading up to their wedding -- was meeting secretly with multiple sex partners in England. In 1924 she would also add Harold Child and H.G. Wells to her list of playmates across the pond. Wells once flattered her by saying she had a "scientific quality of mind," a compliment on which she preened herself even to old age. In the 1920s she also became sexually involved with three Americans: Bill Williams, Herbert Simonds, and Harold Hersey. From 1933 to 1935, in her mid-fifties, she engaged in an affair with Angus Sneed MacDonald, explaining at the end that she could not marry him because it would damage her reputation to be twice-divorced. Thus, the New Woman had to weigh private pleasures against the public appearance of virtue. Even in the 1940s, when she was in her mid-sixties, she had a six-year fling with Hobson Pittman, a landscape painter who was 20 years her junior. She told close friends that he was for fun, "not for keeps," and that she dared not marry him, for fear of what the press might say.</p><p>Her first husband was aware of her infidelities. In response to his rebukes, she insinuated that their marriage might survive if their adulteries were mutual. It was his fault, then, if he was unadventurous, for she would accept no blame for her conduct -- such being "the way of an adulterous woman, who eats and wipes her mouth and says, 'I have done no evil'" (Prov. 30:20). Her second husband, Noah, seems to have been blind to her doings. She managed to keep him in the dark by making him sign a prenuptial contract, pledging that she would have her separate residence with separate keys and that she, the New Woman, would retain full freedom to visit and entertain friends in privacy. She guarded this privacy fiercely -- as well she might. Such was the founder of Planned Parenthood. And since figs are not gathered from thorns, or grapes from the bramble bush, the organization which sprang from Ellis and Sanger still keeps the same drumbeat today, now urging the privacy rights of minors -- little girls lured into promiscuity by sex-education, then advised to have abortions without parental knowledge or consent.</p><p>(Side note: No matter how much our local Planned Parenthood declares their Nobody's Fool annual event is mainstream, the vision and mission remains the same. It is their annual recruitment drive to indoctrinate young people into their pagan sex philosophies to ensure future clients at their birth control/abortion business).</p><p>How empty is a life spent running from one sex partner to another! St. Augustine speaks of how people like her are in endless motion, yet going nowhere -- how they "go about and stand not, how they go in the circle of error, where the journeying is without end." Again and again she confided to her journal that she was lonely, depressed, even despairing -- yet she never changed. By then, maybe, she could no longer change, since vice had turned to addiction, a form of slavery. Though she found no joy in being the New Woman, she made it her life's work to "liberate" other women, too, from chastity and "involuntary motherhood" by means of her Birth Control League.</p><p>(Side note: Can you imagine the condition of the souls that work day in and day out at the Planned Parenthood's abortion mills)?</p><p>Besides this, she had an addiction to vainglory. The stories she told about herself were peppered with lies meant to make her more admirable. She was the sixth of 11 children born to poor Irish parents, but she longed to be of the privileged class, at least by marriage, so she used to claim that Bill Sanger's father had been an English merchant and his mother the daughter of a German mayor. She knew perfectly well that her father-in-law was a Jew who had immigrated in 1878 and worked in the garment district. Moreover, having little formal education but being gifted in the art of imitation, Margaret took over the feminist agenda and rhetoric of Emma Goldman, without so much as a thank you. Much of her talk about "voluntary motherhood" through contraception came from Goldman, but she pretended it was of her own devising, never acknowledging any debt in her autobiographies, and in 1934 even refusing to support Goldman's attempt to regain U.S. citizenship. And here is another instance of how she rewrote her past life to raise herself: In 1939 she claimed that Havelock Ellis had guided her reading at the British Museum for a year and a half, when she had been under his tutelage for only a month and a half. Her fibs were meant to make her seem more ladylike, original, and educated than she really was.</p><p>In 1914, while traveling in Europe with Lorenzo Portet, Margaret sent home articles and letters in which she made her association with him public, but hid its sexual nature, intimating that she was the guest of Portet and his wife. Her biographer notes that beyond a handful of close friends -- not family members or colleagues -- no one knew of her Dionysian side. She rightly feared that the American public would turn in disgust from a birth-control movement championed by so disreputable a woman. From first to last, therefore, she wore the mask of virtue and pretended to fight for birth control for altruistic reasons, rather than because her private behavior made it a dire necessity. To this day, Planned Parenthood keeps up the same pretense of virtue, spreading and supporting unbridled sexuality, while purporting to be defending the rights of privacy and individual autonomy which are allegedly enshrined (though invisibly) in the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>(Side note: "And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works (2 Corinthians 14,15)."</p><p>To prove that what she really wanted was to free women from "involuntary motherhood," Margaret would recount again and again the same sob story about a married woman named Sadie Sachs, who allegedly died in front of her as a result of a second self-induced abortion. Her story presented Sadie as the hapless victim of benighted laws that denied poor Jewish immigrants like her easy access to birth control. Never mind that such immigrants were precisely those whose fertility the eugenicists associated with Margaret wanted to limit or suppress. Margaret provoked tears over Sadie's plight, then launched into the "scientific" side of sex and urged that the medical profession be put in control of women's fertility. To this day, Planned Parenthood uses the same sort of sentimental ploy to preach the message of medical control over late-term abortions and experimentation with embryos.</p><p>(Side note: Liberals always use exterme examples of horrendous circumstances to pull at the heartstrings of average Americans to make mainstream what otherwise would be unthinkable).</p><p>When Noah built her an estate in Fishkill, New York, in the 1920s, she wrote to her playmate Hugh: "If only I could fly by night to London to see you &amp; Havelock &amp; Harold -- I'd be ready to say this is paradise." Then, when she was in England in 1924 sleeping with two new partners, H.G. Wells and Harold Child, she sent Noah effusive love letters, protesting that "England is nothing without my adorable lover husband." She wrote to him at length about her meetings with Harold Child, but made their association look perfectly above board. In later years she would laugh about how she fooled her husband, as for instance on February 2, 1934, when she wrote to Angus MacDonald that she had lied to Noah and his guests about the flowers she had received. If her husband grew suspicious, she rebuked him sharply and then laughed about it later with her partner. Such conduct in a woman of 55 is infantile, and it is proof she had been going in a circle for a long time. No wonder Dante draws Hell as a set of closed circles.</p><p>After the stock-market crash of 1929, Noah was virtually ruined, so Margaret felt less obligated to be by his side. She pretended she was devoting herself night and day to the birth-control movement and would spend months without seeing him (he died in 1943). Even so, she would, like Thaïs the courtesan (sunk in excrement for flatteries to lovers in Dante's Inferno), send him flattering letters about what a terrific lover he was. When her husband grieved over the length of her absences, she told him in no uncertain terms that she was the New Woman who would never compromise her freedom or put aside her public work for any man. Sometimes, too, she used another ploy: She blamed him for misunderstanding her and thus for keeping her at a distance. Before his face, she was the aggrieved wife, but behind his back, a virtual Messalina.</p><p>At Noah's memorial service in Fishkill, Margaret gave herself a eulogy, declaring that she had always "fascinated" Noah, for she was the "quicksilver" that he could never "quite catch." Here she drew an uncannily accurate self-portrait. For quicksilver is mercury, a poisonous substance, and a person who is mercurial is cunning, restless, and unpredictable. Another time she told a sex partner that she was a "will o' the wisp." Again, she chose an eerily revealing image. For a will o' the wisp is a delusory light that dances over a swamp and leads night travelers astray, even to their death by drowning. On some level she seems to have known how destructive a woman she was.</p><p>Since Margaret was an atheist who denied the Redemption and the Resurrection, she found guilt and death nearly impossible to face. When her daughter Peggy died of pneumonia in 1915, shortly after Margaret's return from a year of cavorting abroad, she was haunted by the sound of halting footsteps (Peggy had limped from polio) and had nightmares of losing a child. She dreamed that she was in the middle of a disaster and worried about Peggy, and then she would realize in the dream that she had neglected her child for years and had no clue of her whereabouts. For help in this crisis she turned to the occult. Havelock Ellis introduced her to Rosicrucianism so she could empower herself by connecting to a "spark of divinity" within. He explained to her that science and this type of mysticism were not in conflict. Sunk in loneliness and despair, she would thereafter seek out psychics and theosophists to try to make contact with her child. Her dabbling in the occult led to a delusory comfort: She confided to a friend that she could now talk to her dead child and that she had created a space, separate from the rest of the world, in which Peggy could grow up to maturity. This Peter Pan substitute for the Resurrection did not keep her from bouts of depression, and her sexual escapades offered only temporary reprieves from dejection.</p><p>(Side note: Some in the abortion industry are flat out witches and warlocks, where their religion is feminist spiritually, goddess worship, and abortion is their bloody sacrament. Folks that work at our local Planned Parenthood are also religious. I don't know if any of them are involved with witchcraft, but some of them go to "churches." I've warned them time and again that they are following what the Bible calls "another Jesus, another spirit, and a different gospel." Any Church that allows people into their congregation with the blood of the innocent on their hands unrepented is apostate).</p><p>Toward the end of her life, she confessed that she had long ago "entrusted her spirit" to the Rosicrucian Society, yet she seemed to know little about the Society. In 1951, when she was in her 70s, she enrolled in a Rosicrucian mail-order course to learn more. From that course she became convinced that she would not die because, as her biographer reports, she saw that she "embodied the aspirations of all women on earth" and was "their chosen agent of liberation." Evidently, the Rosicrucians were not in the business of teaching humility! In 1954 she said in an interview that she liked the Rosicrucians "because of their interest in the enhanced spiritual powers of women and their sympathy for political feminism." In this fake spirituality she found fleeting compensation for the brutal emptiness of her scientific materialism.</p><p>After all that, it is not surprising to learn that Margaret had a rabid hatred of the Catholic Church. She rightly saw the Church as the great enemy and chief obstacle of the Birth Control League. In the 1920s Catholics presented a united front and gave public warnings that were clearly inspired and prophetic. They declared that legalizing birth control would lead to refined materialism and selfish individualism, would degrade marriage, would cause husband and wife to see each other as instruments of sexual gratification, and would weaken their self-control, as well as their capacity for self-denial. Even Gandhi agreed with the Catholic view when Margaret Sanger visited him and tried to bring him around to her worldview. Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes of New York put it bluntly: Easy access to artificial contraception would lead to a "wild orgy of atheism and immorality." These predictions have manifestly been fulfilled.</p><p>(Side note: Why did she just have hatred for the Catholic Church? Where was her hatred for the Protestant Church? Perhaps we Protestants were no threat to her evil agenda).</p><p>In the 1930s Catholics also gave prophetic warning that if Margaret Sanger and her Birth Control League had their way, the floodgates of pornography would be opened and abortion would soon be legalized. A generation before Roe v. Wade, they could see that legalized abortion was around the corner once easy access to birth control made immorality rampant.</p><p>In conclusion, Margaret Sanger can be compared to Semiramis, the mythical queen of Babylon who supplanted her husband and made sexual immorality the law of the land. She did this because she herself was lascivious and her abrogation of virtue brought about the ruin of her nation. Margaret Sanger's private life was obviously the hidden spring of her public actions. This now has to be admitted. She worked tirelessly to overturn the laws against obscenity, birth control, and abortion mainly because her secret lifestyle made all these things necessary. For at the root of her agenda and that of Planned Parenthood was and is a pseudo-scientific view of human sexuality as something even lower than the coupling of animals.</p><p>IN KING JESUS' SERVICE,</p><p>Rusty Thomas</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;<img width="268" height="200" alt="" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/Images753.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="external free" title="http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/planned_parenthood.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/planned_parenthood.htm"><font size="4">http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/planned_parenthood.htm</font></a></p><p><br />

August 17, 2001 (Press Release)</p><p><strong>FINANCIAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), the nation's oldest and largest abortion provider, is an organization which is supported by U.S. taxpayers. For this reason, it is the most well funded abortion provider in the nation. In the period from 1987 until 1998, Planned Parenthood received a total of $1.4 billion in taxpayer money, according to Stop Planned Parenthood International (STOPP). PPFA received $176.5 million in government grants and contracts in the period between 1998-99, roughly 75% of which (or $132.4 million) originated from the federal government’s Title X and Title XIX programs. Forty-four million dollars was provided by state and local governments.</p><p>PPFA provided 1,939,039 abortions between the years 1977 and 1995. PPFA’s 1998-99 Annual Report reported that it provided 167,928 abortions in 1998 and 165,174 abortions in 1997. PPFA grossed $60 million in sales of the abortifacient Pill in the period 1997-98, and $45 million of that figure represented its net profit.</p><p>PPFA’s total revenue at the end of the 1999 fiscal year was $660.7 million. With its expenses reported at $534.9 million, the abortion provider reported a total profit of $125.8 million. Assets were reported at a cool $536.3 million for this “non-profit” organization.</p><p>PPFA receives financial support from many millionaires, corporations and foundations, including the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations and billionaire investor Warren Buffet’s foundation.</p><p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) $8.8 million in 2000.

The following statement has appeared on Planned Parenthood's website:</p><p>The possible link between induced abortion and breast cancer is a theory whose principal promoters oppose abortion regardless of its safety. The theory awaits conclusive confirmation by medical researchers. While Planned Parenthood believes that women should have access to information about all factors that influence the risk of disease, PPFA also believes that women deserve information that is medically substantiated and untainted by a political agenda. Because the research community has not reached a consensus on breast cancer and abortion, Planned Parenthood advises women who are considering terminating a pregnancy that there is no currently demonstrated health risk from abortion that would warrant basing a decision on that factor alone. {Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., "Abortion and Breast Cancer: The Issues" 3 (visited Sep. 5, 1997) &lt;<a class="external free" title="http://www.igc.apc.org/ppfa/ab-breas.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.igc.apc.org/ppfa/ab-breas.html">http://www.igc.apc.org/ppfa/ab-breas.html</a>&gt;}.</p><p><br />
Planned Parenthood says that it "awaits conclusive confirmation" of the abortion-breast cancer link before it will inform women of the available studies. However, science cannot prove causation without performing unethical experiments on women. Induced abortion is rarely a life-or-death procedure. On the contrary, it is predominantly an elective surgical procedure. How many thousands more women will unwittingly risk a deadly disease because Planned Parenthood has not yet determined that it has “conclusive confirmation” of the abortion-breast cancer link?</p><p>The web site revealed that PPFA does recognize the possibility of an association between abortion and breast cancer. It explained the biological reasons for the abortion-breast cancer link:</p><p>Reproductive factors have been associated with risk for the disease since the 17th century . . . . It is known that having a full-term pregnancy early in a woman's childbearing years is protective against breast cancer . .. .. . The theory behind a possible link between pregnancy termination and breast cancer is based on the hormonal disruption that occurs when a woman's pregnancy is interrupted. Pregnancy initiates a surge of sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin), which leads to differentiation of the cells in the breast glands in preparation for lactation. The changing concentrations of hormones during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy lead to increased differentiation. In a first pregnancy, the results of these hormonal changes permanently alter the structure of the breast. Interruption during the first trimester of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation, which may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous growth in these tissues. {Id}.</p><p>On November 1, 1994 at a time when there were more than two dozen studies available which showed an association between induced abortion and breast cancer, NBC's news program, Dateline, interviewed the president of Planned Parenthood at that time, Pamela Maraldo, to discuss Planned Parenthood's informed consent policy. The following conversation took place between Maraldo and the reporter:</p><p>Reporter: "If indeed your panel of medical experts studies this study by Dr. Daling and you find it to be solid good science, what are the chances you will begin warning women about this possible link?”</p><p>Maraldo: "Even if it's solid good science, then to begin to warn women, and upset women, on the basis of one study is clearly irresponsible. One study is not an adequate, uh, uh -- evidence for us to change a policy, or -- or to upset or frighten women."</p><p>Reporter: "Five studies -- say you have five studies?"</p><p>Maraldo: "Well I think we're a long ways away from that."</p><p>Why is Planned Parenthood excluding women from this debate about their health? An increased risk of breast cancer would undoubtedly impact the decision making process for many women considering an abortion. Withholding vital information, which is needed to make an informed choice about health matters, is paternalistic censorship. Women have a right to know all of the risks associated with induced abortion.</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><br /><strong><a class="new" title="Dear Champion of the Lord and the Preborn," href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dear_Champion_of_the_Lord_and_the_Preborn%2C&amp;action=edit"><font size="4" color="#008080">Dear Champion of the Lord and the Preborn,</font></a></strong></p><p>The Lord richly bless you!

Apparently not. According to Chris Weinkopf, editorial-page editor of the Los Angeles Daily News, the California Department of Education reports that "96 percent of California school districts provide comprehensive sexual health education" and all California schools have been required to teach HIV/AIDS prevention education since 1992.</p><p>Can we blame the abstinence-only programs promoted by the Bush administration?</p><p>Not in California. Weinkopf notes that state law prohibits 'abstinence-only' education in the public schools. In addition, California may be the only state in the country that has refused to accept millions of federal dollars for abstinence education.</p><p>"This [soaring rate of sexually-transmitted infections] is no surprise," said Linda Klepacki, sexual health analyst for Focus on the Family Action in an online press release. "California has insisted on teaching contraceptive-based sex education in their schools all along. They expect teens to be sexually active. They don’t raise the health standard to abstinence… It's clear California supports sexually active teens, and STI rates will naturally explode with these policies."</p><p>Another factor in the out-of-control disease rates among California children and young adults may be the introduction of the “morning-after” pill. According to testimony offered to the FDA in 2004, sexually-transmitted infections soared in the British Isles when “Plan B” (the morning-after pill) was made available without prescription in 2000. Ignoring the warning signals from the UK, California subsequently became one of the first states to permit the sale of Plan B over-the-counter without an age limit.

October 13, 2007</p><p>A substantial increase in suicide rates among people ages 10 to 24 has been confirmed by recently released statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). At the same time, a UCLA psychiatrist says promiscuity -- which she believes is the root cause of much depression -- is being ignored by doctors who choose to treat their patients with anti-depressants instead of psychiatric help.</p><p>Dr. Miriam Grossman says the problem with that option is that the CDC's report stated that young people taking depression medication are among the 8 percent jump in suicides -- evidence to Grossman that only symptoms are being addressed, and not causes. "There are approximately 1,100 successful suicides on our campuses every year -- a very, very startlingly high number," she says.</p><p><strong>Causes before cures</strong></p><p>To get to the root of the problem, Grossman says one has to backtrack to a related topic -- depression -- which she says is at epidemic levels on college campuses, and is usually closely related to suicide.</p><p>Furthermore, it is her assertion that there is a reason that is not discussed by the medical community for all the depression symptoms -- ranging from anxiety to insomnia, eating disorders and many other emotional problems. Grossman calls it "the anything goes sexual free-for-all" that exists among students, primarily on college campuses. "Parents need to know that dating is pretty much dead these days. College students hang out in groups, and then they pair off and 'hook up,'" she states.</p><p><strong>A new age?</strong></p><p>Grossman says a hook-up is defined as an unplanned sexual encounter between two people who do not have definite plans to speak again. "So you can understand that it's [a] no-strings-attached, no-emotions-attached, casual sort of set-up. And this is different than the way it was in past generations, because it's normalized ... and we have between 40 and 80 percent of college students participating in hooking up," she points out.</p><p>But with the rampant physical symptoms of depression, and the known biological changes that take place following sexual contact, can there really be no emotional, physical or spiritual after-effects of a morally neutral social lifestyle? Based on contacts with multitudes of students who regularly come to her office for treatment, Grossman definitely believes the answer is no.</p><p>Grossman authored the book Unprotected: A Campus Psychiatrist Reveals How Political Correctness in Her Profession Endangers Every Student. "My book is filled with stories of students who have come to me. They've followed the guidelines for 'safer sex,' and done everything the health center has told them to do -- and they still have ended up in my office, casualties of the hook-up culture," she states.</p><p><br />

Even though a Johnson County district judge found probable cause that Planned Parenthood committed these crimes, the organization claims the charges are simply political. But is a pattern of illegal activity starting to emerge? Are we starting to connect the dots?</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>The scope</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood is enormous. Even though it portrays itself as a grassroots organization, Planned Parenthood encompasses so much more.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>During its 2005-2006 fiscal year, Planned Parenthood reported a total income of $902.8 million. To provide perspective, this is more than the combined revenues during the same period for the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association. In Planned Parenthood’s almost-billion-dollar budget, $305.3 million came from you, the taxpayers.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>This money does not sit in a stale corporate office. It is obtained and used by 117 affiliates across the country. Planned Parenthood operates facilities in 859 locations that serve as local focal points to spread its philosophies throughout your communities.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>With this much money, personnel and locations, Planned Parenthood is a major force in the effort to sexualize America. Is it a leap to suggest that Planned Parenthood might have broken a few laws along the way?</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Statutory rape reporting</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Numerous cases suggest that Planned Parenthood does not properly report statutory rape. Under state laws, workers at Planned Parenthood clinics are mandatory reporters. It must report child abuse to the authorities. In every state, a child under 14 years of age cannot consent to sexual activity. If Planned Parenthood knows that a young child is sexually active with an older partner, it must report this activity. However, it doesn’t always do so.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood Golden Gate even bragged about one egregious case on its web site. It displayed a letter from a girl praising the clinic for keeping her rape secret. But the girl was 11 years old at the time of her rape by her 17-year-old boyfriend. After American Life League uncovered this story, Planned Parenthood promptly removed the letter, but did not even claim to have reported the rape to authorities.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Another alarming report came out of Waco, Texas. Planned Parenthood of Waco claims that it reports 98 statutory rape cases per year. However, Waco researchers dug into all official records and only found 7.3 reports per year. Planned Parenthood never explained the absence of each year’s 91 missing reports. Why isn’t it held accountable?</p><p>&#160;</p><p>With all these incidents of failed reporting, civil cases are cropping up. One terrible example comes from Denise Fairbanks in Ohio. This suit alleges that Planned Parenthood failed to report a father’s abuse of his daughter since she was 13 years old. Instead, Planned Parenthood performed an abortion on Denise and sent her home, allowing the abuse to continue for over a year. Finally, the father was convicted of sexual assault. Unfortunately, the deception does not end here.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Death cover-ups</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood provides invasive surgical procedures to its patients. Contrary to Planned Parenthood’s claims, abortions entail serious risks. Instead of promptly notifying health authorities when patients are injured, Planned Parenthood appears to cover up these incidents.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>In 2002, Diana Lopez bled to death after her cervix was punctured during an abortion at the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood. The California Department of Health Services cited Planned Parenthood for seven separate violations of health regulations, including failing to notify the health department of Ms. Lopez’s death within 24 hours. The other citations centered on failing to properly prepare for the procedure, advise the patient of risks and keep sufficient records about Ms. Lopez.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>While Planned Parenthood would claim this was an isolated incident, the facts say otherwise. Earlier this year, 21-year-old Edrica Goode died from toxic shock after beginning an abortion procedure through Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties. The California Department of Health Services again filed a deficiency ruling against Planned Parenthood for failing to report Ms. Goode’s death within 24 hours. After repeating this same violation, it begins to look like Planned Parenthood does not respect medical regulations.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Kansas criminal charges</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>With this short background on Planned Parenthood, the pending criminal charges in Kansas do not seem outlandish. By looking deeper into the charges, their substance and weight becomes even more apparent.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Planned Parenthood was required to turn over 29 patient files for a government investigation. The files were completely sanitized of patient identification, so no breach of patient privacy existed. During the investigation, the Johnson County district attorney determined that all 29 files revealed an unlawful late-term abortion.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Abortion is legal in Kansas after a doctor certifies the baby is not viable. In order to perform a late-term (post-viability) abortion, Kansas law requires that two doctors certify the abortion is necessary for the mother’s mental or physical health. The charges allege that Planned Parenthood did not appropriately follow these laws and keep accurate documentation about the doctors’ findings.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Is it a leap to think the Kansas charges are accurate? After several other instances of failing to follow laws and regulations, Planned Parenthood’s reputation is stained. It claims to have medical standards in place at its clinics, but Planned Parenthood refuses to reveal any information to you. The American people should insist that Planned Parenthood precisely follow all laws and regulations.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Instead of letting Planned Parenthood sweep the Kansas criminal charges away, it should come to court and defend itself. Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri is innocent until proven guilty, but the Johnson County district attorney should have the chance to prove his case. District attorneys around the country should be encouraged by this example and begin their own investigations to hold Planned Parenthood accountable.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Andrew Flusche is the staff attorney at American Life League.
