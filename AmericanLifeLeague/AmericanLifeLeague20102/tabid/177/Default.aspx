During this National Women’s Health Week especially – women deserve to be better informed on what they’re putting in their bodies.”<br /><br />
While it is estimated that over 12 million American women take the birth control pill, the Mayo Clinic warns that birth control use is one of the major contributing factors for pulmonary embolism and blood clots. Hormonal birth control is considered a class one carcinogen – alongside cigarettes - in cancer-causing potential.<br /><br />
Scientists also warn that birth control in the nation’s waterways is wreaking havoc on fish populations – a fact that could have a significant domino impact up the food chain.<br /><br />
A 2006 study conducted in the waters of the Potomac River and its tributaries found that 80 percent of the male small mouth bass were strange intersex fish – these male fish were growing female reproductive parts. Scientists have also found that exposure to estrogen reduces the production of immune related proteins in fish, making them more susceptible to disease.&#160; This could explain why intersex fish, massive fish kills and fish with lesions coexist in the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers.<br /><br />
According to Conrad Volz, co-director of exposure assessment at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute's Center for Environmental Oncology, “We need to pay attention to chemicals that are estrogenic in nature, because they find their way back into the water we all use.”<br /><br />

Excerpts from <em>Choices in Matters of Life &amp; Death</em> by Judie Brown with Paul Brown</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="73"><strong><font size="4">For any particular cause to succeed, one must somehow frame the issue, change the language and attempt to have an impact on public opinion. The pro-abortion movement has been very successful in changing the language. A very popular word we see all over the place today is “choice.”&#160;</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="74"><strong><font size="4">Before the pro-death movement took over, we knew the word “choice” meant deciding which car we were going to buy, or what we would choose in the grocery store if there were several different brands. But today the word “choice” is on a par with the word “me.” “Choice” often connotes selfishly deciding what’s best for me – not selecting a bargain; not selecting what would be best for our family, but rather, selecting something by “choice” that is best for me as an individual. Me, the selfish person; “Choice,” the exclamation of the selfish me. And, in accord with this definition of “choice,” the preborn baby certainly has no choice.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="75"><strong><font size="4">We have to answer the persuasive pro-death vocabulary with the facts. When NOW and similar groups say a woman has a right to choose, what they don’t say is that the woman has a right to choose to kill another human being. They never finish the sentence – and that gives quite a definition to the word “choice.”</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="76"><strong><font size="4">What about the phrase “every child a wanted child”? To call a child – a human being – a commodity is exactly what that phrase does. It equates children with things. You might want a new car; you might want a loaf of bread different from the one you bought. But you certainly can’t place a human being on the same level with a possession.&#160;</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="77"><strong><font size="4">But that is what has happened. Our children have become property, things we can want or not want, and therefore it becomes easy for us as a society to look on preborn children and decide for ourselves what this child will or will not be able to achieve and whether or not we even want the child. Thus, decisions are made to abort human beings.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="78"><strong><font size="4">This is where PERSONHOOD comes in. The human personhood movement seeks to restore the original intent of the Constitution by defining every human being as a "person" from his or her biological beginning.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="79"><strong><font size="4">The need to amend the Constitution by clarifying the definition of personhood can be explained by visiting a landmark Supreme Court decision. In 1965, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em>, suddenly found the "right to privacy" in sexual matters in the "emanations” from “penumbras" (shadows) allegedly found in the Constitution. <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em> made human beings property again.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="80"><strong><font size="4">Human beings can be owned in test tubes and wombs. They can be killed, used involuntarily as test objects, destroyed for their stem cells, genetically modified, cloned, dissected and stripped of their dignity. In turn, this so-called "right to privacy" was invoked by the Supreme Court in 1973, in <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, to decriminalize abortion in the United States.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="81"><strong><font size="4">Legal precedent and the Constitution’s original intent support the argument for personhood. The authors of the Constitution clearly intended to protect each human being from his or her biological beginning. Since 1973, this protection has been denied to a whole class of human beings.&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
Modern medical science supports personhood. Any opposition to personhood initiatives will not be based upon legitimate scientific evidence. Personhood removes the politically charged rhetoric of the debate and replaces it with the commonsense principle that life begins at each human being's biological beginning.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="82"><strong><font size="4">The time has come to restore the vocabulary of life and to restore protection to all human beings.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="83"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="83"><strong><font size="4"><em>Expert debunks claim that anti-contraceptive conservatism advances abortion</em><br />

Over the past few years, scientists have discovered that male fish in the nation’s streams, lakes and rivers have been growing female reproductive parts. Scientists point to synthetic estrogen from birth control that has made its way into the nation’s water supply from sewage systems.<br /><br />
“This Earth Day, let’s fight back and save our environment by eliminating Planned Parenthood’s support. One way you can celebrate Earth Day is to join the fight against Planned Parenthood,” said Marie Hahnenberg, director of American Life League’s “The Pill Kills” project.<br /><br />
Planned Parenthood receives millions of tax dollars each year to distribute birth control pills that are toxic to our environment and pose a myriad of health risks to women and their preborn children, including blood clots and cancer.<br /><br />
But on Earth Day 2010, American Life League pointed to the birth control pill’s startling and often overlooked impact on wildlife.<br /><br />
"What we demonstrated is that estrogen can wipe out entire populations of small fish—a key food source for larger fish whose survival could in turn be threatened over the longer term," Dr. Karen Kidd, of the University of New Brunswick told LifeSiteNews after an in-depth study of birth control’s impact on lakes and watersheds. "We've known for some time that estrogen can adversely affect the reproductive health of fish, but ours was the first study to show the long-term impact on the sustainability of wild fish populations," Kidd continued.<br /><br />
Conrad Volz, co-director of exposure assessment at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute’s Center for Environmental Oncology, pointed to the danger posed to human populations: “We need to pay attention to chemicals that are estrogenic in nature, because they find their way back into the water we all use.”<br /><br />

Tobin of Providence, R.I. after both bishops rebuked the Catholic Health Association for the group’s endorsement and support of the Obama health care plan.</em><br /><br />
“In the wake of the Catholic Health Association’s betrayal of the Catholic faith and the lives entrusted to the group, Bishops Tobin and Brandt have set the record straight: You cannot claim to be Catholic and support initiatives that attack the personhood of human beings.<br /><br />
“CHA has turned its back on the Christ-centered health care that has been a hallmark of Catholic ministry in this country since the very first missionaries set foot in the New World centuries ago.<br /><br />
“Thousands of priests, religious and laity have spent their lives in imitation of Christ and His call to care for the sick.It stands to reason, then, that opposing the injustice of abortion and other attacks on human beings’ lives would be central to CHA’s mission.<br /><br />
“CHA’s support for the pro-abortion Obama health bill is a sickening abandonment of the sacred mission entrusted to them. Catholics around the country are left confused, misled and betrayed. Is it any wonder that so many are ignorant of the Catholic Church’s teaching on human personhood when the Catholic Health Association blatantly defies it?<br /><br />
“Bishops Tobin and Brandt have shown themselves to be true shepherds of their flocks by their swift rebuke of CHA.&#160; We hope their brothers bishops unite with them in upholding sound and uncompromising moral principles.<br /><br />
“For this, we express our gratitude and assure the bishops of our prayers for their work.”<br /><br />

It was formed in 2007 when members of the parish saw a need to educate not only the parish but the largely Hispanic community about contraception and the consequences of abortion.&#160; The group provides education on these issues as well as natural family planning and also holds regular prayer vigils outside the Family Planning Association Medical Group, an abortuary in Riverside.&#160; The current group coordinator is Isabel Tovar-Guido.&#160; We’re very pleased to have Queen of Angels Pro-life Group as part of our network and we look forward to working with them!<br /><br /><font color="#ff0000">From Associates<br /></font><br /></font></strong><strong><font size="4"><em>Houston Coalition for Life<br /></em>Planned Parenthood’s late-term abortion facility on Gulf Freeway in Houston appears to be opening soon.&#160; This new abortion facility will provide abortions through 25 weeks of pregnancy.&#160; On April 30, Planned Parenthood is having their grand opening gala and 75th anniversary celebration at the Corinthian Hotel.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1271278998403="68" jquery1271359284942="68" jquery1271679133778="68"><strong><font size="4">Two extremely important action items:</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1271278998403="69" jquery1271359284942="69" jquery1271679133778="69"><strong><font size="4">Contact the Corinthian Hotel and tell them in a respectful way that you are extremely disappointed to learn that the hotel is hosting Planned Parenthood’s celebration.

Connecticut</em>, the Court created the “right to privacy.” There never has been in the U.S. Constitution a right to privacy, but in 1965, to legalize all forms of birth control for married couples, the Court ruled that couples have a “right to privacy” and therefore the state has no compelling interest, even in alerting them to the medical side effects of birth control.

Marie Hahnenberg, project director of the Pill Kills Day, agreed.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">“Women need to talk to their doctors about healthier and safer alternatives than the birth control pill,” Hahnenberg said. “The pharmaceutical industries are doing everything they can to ignore the estimated 25,000 lawsuits in the U.S. alone. During this National Women’s Health Week especially – women deserve to be better informed on what they’re putting in their bodies.”<br /><br />
While it is estimated that over 12 million American women take the birth control pill, the Mayo Clinic warns that birth control use is one of the major contributing factors for pulmonary embolism and blood clots. Hormonal birth control is considered a class one carcinogen – alongside cigarettes - in cancer-causing potential.<br /><br />
Scientists also warn that birth control in the nation’s waterways is wreaking havoc on fish populations – a fact that could have a significant domino impact up the food chain.<br /><br />
A 2006 study conducted in the waters of the Potomac River and its tributaries found that 80 percent of the male small mouth bass were strange intersex fish – these male fish were growing female reproductive parts. Scientists have also found that exposure to estrogen reduces the production of immune related proteins in fish, making them more susceptible to disease.&#160; This could explain why intersex fish, massive fish kills and fish with lesions coexist in the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers.<br /><br />
According to Conrad Volz, co-director of exposure assessment at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute's Center for Environmental Oncology, “We need to pay attention to chemicals that are estrogenic in nature, because they find their way back into the water we all use.”<br /><br />

Excerpts from <em>Choices in Matters of Life &amp; Death</em> by Judie Brown with Paul Brown</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="73"><strong><font size="4">For any particular cause to succeed, one must somehow frame the issue, change the language and attempt to have an impact on public opinion. The pro-abortion movement has been very successful in changing the language. A very popular word we see all over the place today is “choice.”&#160;</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="74"><strong><font size="4">Before the pro-death movement took over, we knew the word “choice” meant deciding which car we were going to buy, or what we would choose in the grocery store if there were several different brands. But today the word “choice” is on a par with the word “me.” “Choice” often connotes selfishly deciding what’s best for me – not selecting a bargain; not selecting what would be best for our family, but rather, selecting something by “choice” that is best for me as an individual. Me, the selfish person; “Choice,” the exclamation of the selfish me. And, in accord with this definition of “choice,” the preborn baby certainly has no choice.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="75"><strong><font size="4">We have to answer the persuasive pro-death vocabulary with the facts. When NOW and similar groups say a woman has a right to choose, what they don’t say is that the woman has a right to choose to kill another human being. They never finish the sentence – and that gives quite a definition to the word “choice.”</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="76"><strong><font size="4">What about the phrase “every child a wanted child”? To call a child – a human being – a commodity is exactly what that phrase does. It equates children with things. You might want a new car; you might want a loaf of bread different from the one you bought. But you certainly can’t place a human being on the same level with a possession.&#160;</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="77"><strong><font size="4">But that is what has happened. Our children have become property, things we can want or not want, and therefore it becomes easy for us as a society to look on preborn children and decide for ourselves what this child will or will not be able to achieve and whether or not we even want the child. Thus, decisions are made to abort human beings.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="78"><strong><font size="4">This is where PERSONHOOD comes in. The human personhood movement seeks to restore the original intent of the Constitution by defining every human being as a "person" from his or her biological beginning.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="79"><strong><font size="4">The need to amend the Constitution by clarifying the definition of personhood can be explained by visiting a landmark Supreme Court decision. In 1965, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em>, suddenly found the "right to privacy" in sexual matters in the "emanations” from “penumbras" (shadows) allegedly found in the Constitution. <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em> made human beings property again.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="80"><strong><font size="4">Human beings can be owned in test tubes and wombs. They can be killed, used involuntarily as test objects, destroyed for their stem cells, genetically modified, cloned, dissected and stripped of their dignity. In turn, this so-called "right to privacy" was invoked by the Supreme Court in 1973, in <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, to decriminalize abortion in the United States.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="81"><strong><font size="4">Legal precedent and the Constitution’s original intent support the argument for personhood. The authors of the Constitution clearly intended to protect each human being from his or her biological beginning. Since 1973, this protection has been denied to a whole class of human beings.&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
Modern medical science supports personhood. Any opposition to personhood initiatives will not be based upon legitimate scientific evidence. Personhood removes the politically charged rhetoric of the debate and replaces it with the commonsense principle that life begins at each human being's biological beginning.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="82"><strong><font size="4">The time has come to restore the vocabulary of life and to restore protection to all human beings.</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="83"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p jquery1272027150518="83"><strong><font size="4"><em>Expert debunks claim that anti-contraceptive conservatism advances abortion</em><br />

Over the past few years, scientists have discovered that male fish in the nation’s streams, lakes and rivers have been growing female reproductive parts. Scientists point to synthetic estrogen from birth control that has made its way into the nation’s water supply from sewage systems.<br /><br />
“This Earth Day, let’s fight back and save our environment by eliminating Planned Parenthood’s support. One way you can celebrate Earth Day is to join the fight against Planned Parenthood,” said Marie Hahnenberg, director of American Life League’s “The Pill Kills” project.<br /><br />
Planned Parenthood receives millions of tax dollars each year to distribute birth control pills that are toxic to our environment and pose a myriad of health risks to women and their preborn children, including blood clots and cancer.<br /><br />
But on Earth Day 2010, American Life League pointed to the birth control pill’s startling and often overlooked impact on wildlife.<br /><br />
"What we demonstrated is that estrogen can wipe out entire populations of small fish—a key food source for larger fish whose survival could in turn be threatened over the longer term," Dr. Karen Kidd, of the University of New Brunswick told LifeSiteNews after an in-depth study of birth control’s impact on lakes and watersheds. "We've known for some time that estrogen can adversely affect the reproductive health of fish, but ours was the first study to show the long-term impact on the sustainability of wild fish populations," Kidd continued.<br /><br />
Conrad Volz, co-director of exposure assessment at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute’s Center for Environmental Oncology, pointed to the danger posed to human populations: “We need to pay attention to chemicals that are estrogenic in nature, because they find their way back into the water we all use.”<br /><br />

“In the wake of the Catholic Health Association’s betrayal of the Catholic faith and the lives entrusted to the group, Bishops Tobin and Brandt have set the record straight: You cannot claim to be Catholic and support initiatives that attack the personhood of human beings.<br /><br />

“CHA’s support for the pro-abortion Obama health bill is a sickening abandonment of the sacred mission entrusted to them. Catholics around the country are left confused, misled and betrayed. Is it any wonder that so many are ignorant of the Catholic Church’s teaching on human personhood when the Catholic Health Association blatantly defies it?<br /><br />
“Bishops Tobin and Brandt have shown themselves to be true shepherds of their flocks by their swift rebuke of CHA.&#160; We hope their brothers bishops unite with them in upholding sound and uncompromising moral principles.<br /><br />
“For this, we express our gratitude and assure the bishops of our prayers for their work.”<br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown.

Connecticut</em>, the Court created the “right to privacy.” There never has been in the U.S. Constitution a right to privacy, but in 1965, to legalize all forms of birth control for married couples, the Court ruled that couples have a “right to privacy” and therefore the state has no compelling interest, even in alerting them to the medical side effects of birth control.
