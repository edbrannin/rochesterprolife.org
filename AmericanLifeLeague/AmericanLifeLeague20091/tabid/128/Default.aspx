The rollback of the "conscience rule" comes just two months after the Bush administration announced it last year in one of its final policy initiatives.

Such is the case with the growing popularity of personhood not only within the pro-life movement but within the political structure of various state legislatures as well.<br /><br />
The most recent addition to the mounting list of personhood victories is the State Senate in Montana, where just yesterday they passed a proposal authored by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=180&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">State Senator Dan McGee</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">.&#160;He has distinguished himself in many ways over his political career, but most recently his call for personhood has made him a favorite among pro-life leaders who realize that without personhood the civil rights of preborn children will always be in jeopardy.<br /><br />
The bill that narrowly passed in the state senate, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=157&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">26-24</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">,&#160; makes the following statement, "...</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=169&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">person </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">means a human being at all stages of human development of life, including the state of fertilization or conception, regardless of age, health, level of functioning, or condition of dependency."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In other words, should the bill pass the Montana state house as well, and go to the voters as a ballot measure in 2010, it would provide the people of the state with a great deal to think about when it comes to addressing exactly who is that human being who dies every time an abortion is committed. It would further challenge that status quo in a way that has never been done in the past.<br /><br />
In this struggle to defend the rights of the most vulnerable Americans in our midst, Montana becomes the second state this year to actually say, in one of the two legislative houses, that people of all ages deserve equal protection under the law. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=179&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">North Dakota</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> became the first state just a week ago.

Such progress is a huge hurdle for the evermore-frustrated proponents of the abortion establishment’s status quo. This is one of the reasons why I believe strongly that commentator </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=168&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">William Saletan </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">has extended a tired, but oh so tempting hand by telling his readers that the challenge that faces both pro-lifers and pro-abortionists is, simply as follows:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">…to put these two issues together. For liberals, that means taking abortion seriously as an argument for contraception. We should make the abortion rate an index of national health, like poverty or infant mortality. The president should report progress, or lack thereof, in the State of the Union. <br /><br />
Reproductive-health counselors must speak bluntly to women who are having unprotected sex. And as Mr. Obama observed last year, men must learn that “responsibility does not end at conception.”<br /><br />
Conservatives, in turn, need to face the corollary truth: A culture of life requires an ethic of contraception. Birth control isn’t a sin or an offense against life, as so many girls and Catholic couples have been taught. It’s a loving, conscientious way to prevent the conception of a child you can’t bear to raise and don’t want to abort. It’s an act of responsibility and respect for life.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">See what I mean by the “peculiar penchant”?&#160; The man who can write with a straight face that abortion is killing wishes to placate the mushy, amoral middle, by calling on what he sees as “liberal” versus “conservative” factions to get it together and find that age-old common ground called contraception.<br /><br />
Dear Mr. Saletan, when will you learn that those of us who work so hard to defend the rights of our brothers and sisters who await birth already know that contraception is the root cause of abortion?&#160; <br />
Sociologist </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=174&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Lionel Tiger</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> knows it. “With effective contraception controlled by women, there are still more abortions than ever…Contraception causes abortion.” <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=181&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Christopher Tietze</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, a Planned Parenthood researcher, knew it too and wrote in 1981,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">[A] high correlation between abortion experience and contraceptive experience ... women who have practiced contraception are more likely to have had abortions than those who have not practiced contraception, and women who have had abortions are more likely to have been contraceptors than women without a history of abortion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In addition, it is a fact, a fact that has been recognized by the very people who work so hard to see that abortion is a “right” and a “privilege,” that they themselves were the most influential in convincing the medical community that pregnancy had to be redefined. They did this so that their promotion of contraception would not put them in the embarrassing position of admitting that the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=178&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">pill aborts children</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. As a matter of fact,&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">At the 1964 Population Council symposium, Dr. Samuel Wishik pointed out that acceptance or rejection of birth control would depend on whether it caused an early abortion. Dr. Tietze, of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council suggested, as a public relations ploy, "not to disturb those people for whom this is a question of major importance." Tietze added that theologians and jurists have always taken the prevailing biological and medical consensus of their times as factual, and that "if a medical consensus develops and is maintained that pregnancy, and therefore life, begins at implantation, eventually our brethren from the other faculties will listen."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Therefore it isn’t really that peculiar that a latter day culture war expert like Saletan would make a sincere effort to encourage principled pro-lifers to set aside their alleged religious beliefs and buy into the lie that contraception will curtail the number of abortions. That very argument is a tale as old as the culture of death, and it will persist until personhood is finally the mantra of the America people and the Constitutional fact it should always have been.<br /><br />
The last thing the pro-aborts want to admit is that our quest for personhood and our absolute opposition to contraception has nothing to do with religious beliefs but everything to do with truly caring for the health and welfare of our fellow human beings, born and preborn.<br /><br />
Mark my words, folks. Peculiar penchants are going to increase, and the one that always disturbs me the most is not Saletan’s, but that dehumanizing, but ever popular query, “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=167&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Should fertilized eggs have rights?</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">” <br /><br />
My response to this one is, simply “Probably not if they are the product of plant or animal reproduction, but when they are of human origin they should have the same rights as you and I.&#160; After all, that “fertilized egg” is actually a human being, an individual, a unique person with his own DNA.”&#160;&#160; <br /><br />

It is written in a very special code on DNA, and the first cell is the first part of the magnetic reading machine, so that it will decipher the code on DNA, and play human life.

We know that at the beginning there is a message, and this message, if it is spelled out in the human way, makes what is a human.”</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">“Ah, but let’s not confuse the people with facts,” our opponents would say.&#160; “Let’s just give them another peculiar penchant that convinces them that pro-lifers who argue in favor of personhood are really talking about mere eggs, not real babies!”<br /><br />
Get ready, folks, because the counterfeit words are going to&#160;be slung around like rotten eggs.&#160; Let’s just be prepared to debunk every one of them.&#160; After all, there never was a peculiar penchant that couldn’t be disposed of with simple facts.</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="3">&#160;<strong>P</strong></font><font size="4"><strong>ro-Life Today |&#160;25&#160;February 2009</strong></font></p><p><em><strong><font size="3"><u>Your National Daily News Wrap from American Life League!</u> American Life League is the largest grassroots pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.

The Guttmacher report provides ammunition for those who will advocate the funding increase.<br /><br />
Surveying data from the 2006 fiscal year, the report says the national family planning program prevented 1.94 million unintended pregnancies, including almost 400,000 teen pregnancies. Based on statistical analysis and projections, these pregnancies would have resulted in 860,000 unintended births, 810,000 abortions and 270,000 miscarriages, according to the report.<br />

In the "wide variety" of oral contraceptives that are available, the "mechanisms of action" are the same, said the statement: "inhibition of ovulation, alteration in the cervical mucus, and/or modification of the endometrium, thus preventing implantation."&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Further the term "unintended pregnancy" is a conveniently negative statement designed to alienate the couple who has engaged in sexual relations and did not "intend" to have a baby. The subconscious idea is that a preborn child is a problem that the mother needs to eliminate because she did not "intend" to have him. <br /><br />
Though PP points out that more of these "unintended" children are born than die, the fact is that not one of them should ever have to die based on parental intention. Let's face it, if a couple does not want to have a family, then abstain from the activity that makes having a family possible! That's common sense.<br /><br />
Not only that, but </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=18&amp;L=126&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Stop Planned Parenthood International</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> pointed out in its weekly <em>Wednesday STOPP Report</em> that PP is not effective at reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy anyway! <br /><br />
To prove their point, STOPP cites a </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=18&amp;L=133&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Brookings Institute report</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> which states:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">With premarital sex the rule, rather than the exception, an out-of-wedlock childbirth gradually ceased to be a sign that society's sexual taboos had been violated. The reduction in stigma also helps explain why women who would once have put their baby up for adoption chose to keep it instead.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">It is of interest that as in the case with the ASRM, Brookings is no bastion of pro-life philosophy. In fact, they promote abortion as the proper response to "unintended pregnancy." But my point is quite simple: PP's Alan Guttmacher Institute is standing before Congress with hands extended, asking for more money for programs that frankly have not worked. These "programs" have created a situation in which more young people are damaged for life because of sexually transmitted diseases and have a given those same young people a rather warped perspective on the value of saving sex until marriage.<br /><br />

What these anti-baby fanatics are really saying is that spending taxpayer dollars on helping the expectant mother through her nine month pregnancy and then helping her with the costs involved in giving birth is simply not worthy of taxpayer support, but recommending contraception and abortion is!

There is no doubt he was referring to every human being, born and preborn. He would therefore, undoubtedly be very proud of the state of North Dakota.<br /><br />
The North Dakota House has already passed a </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=118&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">personhood bill</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> that is undeniably among the most concise statements of fact in the nation. The bill reads as follows:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Section 1. References to individual, person or human being â€“ Legislative Intent. For purposes of interpretation of the constitution and laws of North Dakota, it is the intent of the legislative assembly that an individual, a person, when the context indicates that a reference to an individual is intended, or a human being includes any organism with the genome of homo sapiens.<br /><br />
Section 2. State to Defend Challenge. The legislative assembly, by concurrent resolution, may appoint one or more of its members, as a matter of right and in the legislative member's official capacity, to intervene to defend this Act in any case in which this Act's constitutionality is challenged.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=112&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">State Representative Dan Ruby</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> is the state's leader on this bill and his courageous defense of personhood is inspiring.

Dan Ruby, R-Minot, has been getting attention across the nation.<br /><br />
The bill defines human life as beginning at conception and would allow constitutional rights to extend to every unborn human whether in or out of the womb.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Actually, the language of the bill is much more precise than what the newspaper reported. This is necessary in a piece of legislation as crucial as North Dakota's H.R. 1572 because the word "conception" has been co-opted by the abortion movement. It was once accepted that "conception" meant the moment when a human being begins biologically, at fertilization. However, with the passage of time, the pro-aborts have caused a change and today </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=116&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">conception </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">is defined in many quarters as implantation, thus denying that anyone is conceived before he or she is eight days old and firmly attached to his mother's uterus. <br /><br />
Thus, the language of this bill had to state "a human being includes any organism with the genome of homo sapiens." This linguistic precision acknowledges the existence of any human being from his beginning whether he comes into being asexually or sexually. That may sound like splitting hairs, but clearly, we cannot be too careful. The stakes are too high. <br /><br />
With this tremendous victory in North Dakota, which is far from over since the state senate has yet to vote, we were caught up in a moment of celebration. We nearly forgot about such concerns as Nancy Pelosi's visit with Pope Benedict XVI.&#160; But Joe Murray's article in the </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=117&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Philadelphia Bulletin</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3"> reminded us that not all is rosy in pro-life land these days.<br /><br />
In Murray's article, "Pope, Pelosi and Personhood" he presents the entire perspective, or what I call the good, the bad and the very ugly. Murray makes a point to clarify the questionable position Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi takes when she defines herself as an "ardent" Catholic, but his analysis goes far beyond Pelosi-isms. <br /><br />
He writes</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Aside from North Dakota, Maryland, Montana, South Carolina and Alabama have introduced personhood bills, while efforts are currently underway in Mississippi and Oregon. On the federal level, U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., has introduced the federal personhood measure.<br /><br />
And though Democrats, led largely by Mrs. Pelosi, a pro-abortion Catholic, continue to impede such measures, Pope Benedict XVI recently reminded the lawmaker her faith should come before her ideology in a meeting this week at the Vatican.<br /><br />
"His Holiness took the opportunity to speak of the requirements of the natural moral law and the Church's consistent teaching on the dignity of human life from conception to natural death which enjoins all Catholics, and especially legislators, jurists and those responsible for the common good of society, to work in cooperation with all men and women of good will in creating a just system of laws capable of protecting human life at all stages of its development," the Vatican wrote in a statement released moments prior to the two meeting.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">So, as the pro-life movement stands at the crossroads of finally addressing personhood in more states than ever before in our 36-year history, we have this convergence of events. We continue to witness the intransigence of the pro-abortion Catholic, the moral clarity of Catholic teaching and the bold, new face of the personhood pro-lifer. It is really quite a historic moment for all of us who fight for the human rights of the most defenseless in our midst. <br /><br />
Every pro-lifer understands Pelosi's wrongheadedness, and each is grateful for Pope Benedict XVI's loving correction of the lovely lady at the very moment when personhood is being voted on in North Dakota. We do not think for a moment that these events occurred in the same time frame by accident. <br /><br />
So yesterday, you can imagine my surprise when I read the blathering of Professor Douglas Kmiec, an Obama Catholic, who not only challenges what the Holy Father's statement said in reference to Pelosi, but calls on him to correct himself.<br /><br />
Oh yes! </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=110&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Kmiec </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">writes in <em>Time </em>magazine online,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Might there be a different, less intrusive course for the Church? Yes: clarify the Pelosi statement by continuing to observe the difference between a jurist and a legislator. That may be awkward from the standpoint of the unyielding lines of moral rather than political principle, but it has the merit of following the instruction of St. Thomas Aquinas, who argued that "all should have some part in the government; for in this way peace is preserved among the people, and all are pleased with such a disposition of things and maintain it."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Few are pleased with the abortion jurisprudence as it is. But imposing moral duties on Catholic jurists that are incompatible with their envisioned judicial role in a democracy is hardly likely to make it better.<br /><br />
One can only define what Kmiec is saying here as balderdash, or more to the point, rubbish! For any right-thinking person in public life, Catholic or otherwise, the moral principles of defending the right to life are unchanging, regardless of his role as lawmaker or judge. Perhaps Kmiec should refresh his understanding of what makes democracy work. Perhaps he should pay close attention to what Pope John Paul II wrote in </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=109&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Splendor of Truth</font></strong></em></a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">The Church's firmness in defending the universal and unchanging moral norms is not demeaning at all. Its only purpose is to serve man's true freedom. Because there can be no freedom apart from or in opposition to the truth, the categorical â€” unyielding and uncompromising â€” defence of the absolutely essential demands of man's personal dignity must be considered the way and the condition for the very existence of freedom. <br /><br />
This service is directed to <em>every man</em>, considered in the uniqueness and singularity of his being and existence: only by obedience to universal moral norms does man find full confirmation of his personal uniqueness and the possibility of authentic moral growth. For this very reason, this service is also directed to <em>all mankind</em>: it is not only for individuals but also for the community, for society as such. These norms in fact represent the unshakable foundation and solid guarantee of a just and peaceful human coexistence, and hence of genuine democracy, which can come into being and develop only on the basis of the equality of all its members, who possess common rights and duties. <em>When it is a matter of the moral norms prohibiting intrinsic evil, there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone</em>. It makes no difference whether one is the master of the world or the "poorest of the poor" on the face of the earth. Before the demands of morality we are all absolutely equal.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Note his words: "there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone." Whether the lawmaker or would-be judge is supportive of Dan Ruby's proposal in North Dakota or the myriad other legislative proposals that address the wrong of abortion, the obvious fact is the same: Abortion is an intrinsic evil and it must be eradicated from the law. Nothing that results in such a heinous outcome can ever be, in a just society, legal.<br /><br />
We extend our gratitude to Dan Ruby and Pope Benedict XVI; we praise God for the wisdom of Pope John Paul II that lives on through his writings, and we pray for the conversion of heart of folks like Nancy Pelosi and Douglas Kmiec who have somehow lost the ability to see truth with clarity and complete understanding.</font></strong></p><p><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><hr /><p><strong>&#160;<font size="3">Volume 6, Number 8</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;Monday, February 23, 2009</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">Prayer Requests<br />

By ALL Staff</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A stem cell is a type of cell found in all human beings.&#160; They’re found in animals as well. Stem cells have a couple of important characteristics: they can reproduce themselves over a long period of time without changing, and they have the capability to produce other types of specialized cells, such as brain cells, muscle cells and lung cells, to name but a few.&#160; There are a number of different places from which stem cells can be obtained: bone marrow, fat cells, umbilical cord blood, adult blood, skin cells, olfactory nerve endings and embryos.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obtaining stem cells from fatty tissue, bone marrow or the umbilical cord after the birth of a baby may be done ethically. No harm comes to the person whose stem cells are obtained for research in such fashion.&#160; Obtaining stem cells from a human embryo, however, is highly unethical. A human embryo is an innocent human being in his first stage of life. There is only one way to obtain stem cells from a developing human embryo, and it involves killing the embryo. In every case, it is always morally wrong to intentionally kill an innocent human being at any point in life, including the embryonic stage of development. Sacrificing a child in the name of science is still child sacrifice.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">There are those in the government and scientific community who say more money must be spent on human embryonic stem cell research because it holds the most promise for helping people with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.&#160; However, adult stem cells have been used successfully for decades. Bone marrow transplants, for instance, help people every day. There are more than 100 conditions including leukemia, immune system and other blood disorders, cancers and autoimmune diseases that respond well when adult stem cell therapy is used.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Research involving human embryonic stem cells has thus far been unsuccessful in the quest to develop therapeutic treatments. It is speculated that those who support human embryonic stem cell research are clamoring loudly for taxpayer dollars because private companies know human embryonic stem cell research is neither worth their time nor their money.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The popular plea is that human embryonic stem cell research will cure Alzheimer’s disease. However, Alzheimer’s researcher Ned Potter said this research would not help the Alzheimer’s patient at all. It is nerve cells that cause the problem because they lose their ability to connect with each other. Therefore, these embryonic stem cells are not the ones needed. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Far too many reports of possible treatment for diseases are false. Media accounts simply parrot fake science. This is misleading and could lead to the deaths of millions of innocent human beings if this type of research is allowed to move forward.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">According to a recent RAND Corporation survey of in vitro fertilization clinics in the United States, the vast majority of the 400,000 human embryos currently being stored—88.2% of them—are wanted by their parents so that larger families can be part of their future.&#160; But even if this were not the case, there is no justification for killing one innocent human being, regardless of where he lives—including a freezer in a clinic.

"Every day Mr. President, people with your ethnic background die in astounding numbers," said Mr. Hughes.&#160; "Abortion is the number one killer of African Americans in the U.S." Citing abortion statistics, Hughes said: "African Americans make up about 13% of the U.S. population but about 37% of all babies killed by abortion are black.

ACROBATS â€“ CATHOLIC-STYLE</span><br /><em>By Judie Brown</em></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">When your head is swimming from all the commentary ebbing and flowing from yesterday's Pelosi encounter with the Holy Father, the essence of what actually occurred is lost. The fundamental question of our day, what is truth, evaporates in headlines and public pronouncements. One is left asking, is that all there is?<br /><br />
Was this just another media circus? Are the acrobats still swinging? <br /><br />
Why didn't the pope just excommunicate Pelosi, one person asked me! Well, maybe he did, though she clearly has done a pretty good job of excommunicating herself. At least that is my opinion. The fact is nobody knows precisely what was said in that private meeting and the only person who will not "spin" to his advantage is the person who doesn't need to â€¦ Pope Benedict XVI.<br /><br />
I only wish Pelosi was an isolated example of Catholic thinking gone awry, but she is not. <br />
In the halls and classrooms of Boston College, a Catholic university, something new has been added, and as </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=7&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Boston Globe</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3"> reporter Michael Paulsen writes, the reaction is mixed. Said one professor:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">"I believe that the display of religious signs and symbols, such as the crucifix, in the classroom is contrary to the letter and spirit of open intellectual discourse that makes education worthwhile and distinguishes first-rate universities from mediocre and provincial ones," Maxim D. Shrayer, chairman of the department of Slavic and Eastern languages and literatures, said in an interview.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Shrayer is referring to a crucifix, the traditional Catholic icon reminding Catholics of the essence of Catholic identity. Does he know he is actually being paid by a Catholic institution that is striving these days to be proud of its identity? <br /><br />
Perhaps Shrayer would be happier at the Catholic Assumption University in Windsor, Canada, where </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=8&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Father Paul Rennick</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> recently made the following statement to a member of the media, "Abortion is not an infallible teaching. It never has been proclaimed infallibly," he said. <br /><br />
Of interest is that what happened when the reporter from the ardently pro-Catholic, pro-life </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=9&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">LifeSiteNews</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> attempted to contact Bishop Ronald Fabbro, who is the university's chancellor, for a reaction to Father Rennick's statement. Mark Adkinson, Director of Communications for the diocese told the reporter that the bishop was not available for comment, and said, "â€¦I don't view LifeSiteNews as a legitimate news source."<br /><br />
So on the one hand, we have a Catholic university striving to assert its identity even as members of its faculty are decrying that fact. While on the other hand we have a Catholic bishop in Canada who will not address the scandalous comments of a Catholic university president because he denies the integrity of one of the finest news reporting organizations in the entire pro-life, Catholic community.<br /><br />
The acrobats are definitely flying, or are those actually dingbats?<br /><br />
Let's move on to an allegedly Catholic organization's claims that increased spending on welfare programs will result in substantial reductions in state abortion rates while many pro-life laws have the opposite effect. The organization in question, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=10&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, made the claim after they released a study in August of last year. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=11&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Professor Michael New</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> of the University of Alabama kept an eye on this, and just this past week he wrote </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Not surprisingly, this study had a substantial impact on the debate over sanctity of life issues during the 2008 Presidential election. Self proclaimed pro-lifers who support Democratic Presidential nominees can be found in every election cycle. However, this study gave Doug Kmiec, Nicholas Cafardi, and others intellectual legitimacy in arguing that pro-life voters should vote for liberals, even if they favor abortion-on-demand and its public funding, in order to advance the pro-life cause. â€¦ It seemed too good to be true.<br /><br />
It was. In November, with no public announcement, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good removed this study from their website. A replacement version was uploaded shortly thereafter. The replacement version differs from its predecessor in a number of interesting ways. â€¦<br /><br />
It is unfortunate that the faulty research of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good was used as political cover to help make such a thing [the election of Obama] possible. As the Obama administration continues its assault on laws and policies upholding the sanctity of human life, pro-lifers need to hold this organization morally accountable.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">This is but another case of the abuses perpetrated on the American people in the name of a type of fraudulent Catholicism that is neither genuinely Catholic nor ethically sound. <br /><br />
These few examples should provoke us to question and to challenge the legitimacy of those alleged Catholics like Pelosi who parade their identity for the express purpose of creating subversion within the Church where all that is good is denied, while all that is evil is praised.<br /><br />
Such swinging in the wind should also help us express appreciation for those prelates who are dedicated to advancing the truth without regard to media bias, character assassination or attempted humiliation by those who believe their earthly power should make Catholic bishops and priests cower.<br /><br />
When </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dioceseofscranton.org/News/Bishop'sResponseToMisericordiaFebruary16,2009.asp"><strong><font size="3">Scranton Bishop Joseph Martino</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> publicly criticized Misericordia University recently for a scheduled lecture on gay rights by Keith Boykin â€“ a gay rights advocate, the diocese issued a statement in which it said </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Bishop Martino wants Catholics of the Diocese of Scranton to know of his absolute disapproval of Misericordia University's hosting Mr. Boykin. By honoring this speaker through allowing his positions, so antithetical to Catholic Church teaching, to be broadcast on its campus, the University has rejected all four essential characteristics of a Catholic institution of higher learning. These are: its Christian inspiration, its obligation to reflect on knowledge in light of the Catholic faith, its fidelity to Catholic Church teaching and its commitment to serve the people of God.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">But the mainstream media, not at all interested in the ideals that should be upheld by a Catholic university, reported the incident this way:&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">In a prepared statement, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=13&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Misericordia University</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> addressed the controversy surrounding Bishop Martino's criticism. According to the statement, the university understands the bishop's views, but Mr. Boykin's visit to the campus was not meant to advocate for a single issue.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In other words, academic freedom excuses Catholic universities from providing a sound Catholic education to the students. One has to wonder how it is that a Catholic university can defy the bishop while pandering to the politics of abortion, contraception and homosexuality. It must be the thin air up there on the trapeze.<br /><br />
My second example of heroic bishops is Bishop Thomas J. Tobin who recently wrote "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=20&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">My Interview with President Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">." <br /><br />
Obviously, Bishop Tobin did not have this interview, but he told his readers he certainly could imagine having it, and here is an excerpt from one of the most brilliant tongue in cheek perspectives I have ever seen:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">TOBIN: Is it safe to assume that you consider the use of tax dollars to pay for abortions overseas to be good foreign policy? <br /><br />
OBAMA: I believe that people overseas should have the same rights we Americans have â€“ the right to kill their children and use abortion as a form of birth control. <br /><br />
TOBIN: But shouldn't we be using foreign aid for more positive reasons â€“ for example, to provide food, clothing, shelter and medicine to impoverished children? <br /><br />
OBAMA: Bishop, obviously you're missing the point. If you control the population and eliminate the children, you don't have to worry about giving them food, clothing, shelter and medicine now do you?&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In the writings and actions of bishops like Martino and Tobin, we find the fearless response needed to counter the emotional, mental and political acrobatics of those who, like Pelosi, will use any excuse on God's green earth to further insult Christ and His Church.<br /><br />
Like the trapeze artist who flies through the air with the greatest of ease, so-called Catholics like Pelosi, Father Rennick and the leadership of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good will defy gravity, or in this case, truth, for the express purpose of advancing an evil agenda, the centerpiece of which is preborn child killing.<br /><br />
But as we all know, truth prevails where fervent faith is alive. As Christ instructs us, "If your faith were the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it would move; nothing would be impossible for you."

There could be a surprise in store, although as political strategist and writer of “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3602&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Inside Catholic</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">” commentary Deal Hudson points out, "The Holy Father is a head of state and regularly meets with political leaders from every nation, regardless of their positions on issues important to the Church.”&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Hudson comments,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">It's a good idea for Benedict to meet with Pelosi, because one can never underestimate the impact of being in his presence. It's also worth remembering that, if the protocol of past meetings remains the same, the Holy Father will make formal remarks in front of the media before any private meeting. Benedict will very likely make comments criticizing the Obama administration for ending the Mexico City Policy and warning the new Congress against passing the Freedom of Choice Act.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Again, nobody knows how this event will unfold, but we can hope that a miracle occurs.&#160; <br /><br />
On the practical level, the fact is that under the Catholic definition of "heretic," Nancy Pelosi long ago distanced herself from truth, and she is playing a dangerous game.&#160;<br /><br />
The <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> tells us that “<em><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=1212&amp;F=H">Heresy </a></em>is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith.” One of those truths, written in the Ten Commandments, is that&#160;God said, “Thou shalt not kill.”&#160;In discussing this commandment, the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3593&amp;F=H">Catechism </a></em>states,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">2261 Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth commandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous." The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of the Creator. The law forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each and everyone, always and everywhere.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Therefore, if one acknowledges the fact that the act of abortion is an act of murder that takes the life of an innocent human being, one can objectively know that Pelosi, whom I presume was baptized into the Catholic Church, is in denial about a truth that must be believed with divine and Catholic faith.&#160; She is “ardent,” if not downright intransigent, in her views regarding abortion and, as we learned most recently, birth control as well. She offered “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3359&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">no apologies</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">.”</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Therefore, regardless of the smiles, the warm handshakes or whatever else might occur tomorrow, the fact is that Pelosi’s soul is in jeopardy.&#160;This should be of immense concern to all of us and&#160;a reason to pray that perhaps, when Pelosi is in the pope’s presence this time, she will somehow be touched by a spirit of humility that&#160;forces her to confront her demons and deal with truth, instead of&#160;her personal version of what it means to be Catholic.<br /><br />
Pope Benedict has taught us much about the proper formation of conscience, and in one of his most memorable statements, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3599&amp;F=H">Conscience and Truth</a></em>,&#160;he said, "A man of conscience is one who never acquires tolerance, well-being, success, public standing, and approval on the part of prevailing opinion, at the expense of truth." <br /><br />
In this commentary, the Holy Father said there were two standards that define a real voice, a real conscience. “First, conscience is not identical to personal wishes and taste. Secondly, conscience cannot be reduced to social advantage, to group consensus or to the demands of political and social power.”<br /><br />
Dear Nancy, are you listening?<br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3598&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Pope John Paul II</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, with whom then-Cardinal Ratzinger was remarkably close, taught,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3"><em>To be a person of conscience</em> means working to build up the kingdom of God—the kingdom of truth and life, of justice, love and peace—in our families, in the communities in which we live and throughout our homeland.

It is here, at this crossroads between the upright conscience and the dead conscience, that Nancy Pelosi will meet her nemesis, the bane of her existence:&#160;the Vicar of Christ on Earth.&#160;It may well be that she will depart from her meeting with the Holy Father as committed to denying the right to life of innocent preborn babies as she was when she arrived.&#160;It could be that she will never examine her views in the light of the “ardent” faith she claims as her own.&#160;Only God knows what the result will be.&#160;<br /><br />
Regardless, it is clear that her arrogance in even requesting such a meeting is but another sign of the abyss that exists between the truth of God’s Word and Pelosi’s view of what it means to be a believer.&#160;This is why she needs our prayers; this is why her view will not prevail.&#160;Pelosi’s public embrace of the evil of abortion will not go unnoticed by the Holy Father, but I am certain that he will in this encounter be as gentle as Christ and&#160;equally as firm.&#160;We must not forget what he said in his homily on the day of&#160;the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3591&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">inauguration&#160;of his pontificate</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;four years ago:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">The human race – every one of us – is the sheep lost in the desert which no longer knows the way.

Two of the group’s members held large signs and conversed with students on the public sidewalk. According to the group, a campus officer called the police department when they refused to leave the area. Over a dozen squad cars reportedly arrived at the school and the police officers began arresting members of the group.&#160;&#160; Lahoci Franco, 24, one of the sign holders, was the first arrested. According to the group’s press release, protestor Rev. Henry “Bud” Shaver, 30, was told that the sidewalk was not public property for “non-citizens of Birmingham.”<br /><br />

So when I got the following message, my heart went right into my throat (figuratively speaking) and I decided at once that the story was a hoax.<br /><br />
But now I am convinced it is true. The story goes like this. In November of 2008, I received the following e-mail from a fellow pro-lifer in Michigan:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Just after election night when Michigan adopted </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3585&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Proposal 2</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> (which made embryonic stem cell [research] easier to do in Michigan!), a local news station ran a story about a couple who had tried everything to help their toddler who had severe brain trauma. The story claimed that the "victory for stem cell research in MI" would help children and families with similar plights...However, the news reporter refused to mention the exact type of treatment being given to the child. So, I called... <br /><br />
The news station said that the family did not want to divulge any info about the specifics. They just wanted donations. So I went to the family's donation web site and inquired there... <br /><br />
To make a long story short, I assumed that the whole thing was a sham; that the child was most likely receiving adult stem cell therapy, not embryonic. To my knowledge, to date there is NO embryonic research that has had any positive outcomes. I have taught this to adults and youth in my church and school. My facts are based on what I read in ALL, HLI, and similar publications.<br /><br />
Here is where the plot thickens... <br /><br />
The father of the child called me back! He made me insist that I was not a reporter. He went on to tell me that they are paying for treatment from a European doctor … It is alleged that in Europe, women electing abortion are given a chance to "donate their aborted fetus to science." I guess this offers some altruistic sense of generosity toward the public good to women who choose to kill their young. <br /><br />
The father and I talked at length. I told him that I had hoped he would say it was adult stem research b/c I have a family member with a similar condition, but we are devout Catholics and could never use embryos for any treatment for our child. He justified himself, saying he thought and prayed for some time...the fetuses were already dead, and nothing could be done about that...and everyone has to make the choice for themselves...He also asked me to keep the doctor's web site on the QT because he did not want any bad press..</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obviously the parents of this little boy were desperate for help for their child, and the "European doctor" they chose does indeed exist, does have a web site, is actually an American, and has a sordid history.

Rader, a Malibu psychiatrist who ran a chain of eating disorder clinics in Los Angeles, has cooperated with Yuliy Baltaytis in the past. Rader was kicked out of the Bahamas, but not before he had made more than $33 million treating a thousand patients with fetal stem cell injections. Rader says that he has not published anything in the medical literature because it would leave him vulnerable to attacks from a "conspiracy" of scientists, government authorities, and pro-lifers (where have we heard that line before?) The business, which he co-founded with Baltaytis, has run through a succession of names, including Mediquest Ltd., Czech Foundation and Dulcinea. It is now called "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3578&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Medra</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">," and its web site&#160; boasts that it can use fetal stem cells to cause "remarkable physical and psychological improvements" regarding virtually every known ailment, including Alzheimer's, autism, brain damage, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, impotence, leukemia, MS, Parkinson's, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle-cell anemia, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and even the effects of aging. All patients have to do is get to the Dominican Republic, "a one-hour-and-forty-five-minute flight from Miami." Oh, and bring plenty of cash.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Human Life International report also states, the fetal stem cell injection industry is rife with fraud. This is natural whenever massive amounts of money can be made in a very short period of time with all the risk being borne by gullible patients.<br /><br />
It's important to note that in this age of Internet communication, reports and stories can get out there, which can either be totally fabricated, or as real as the nose on your face. And in Rader's case, his reviewers and those who know of his work are anything but a cheering fan club. For example, "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3575&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Cure A.L.S Ride for Life Online</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">" tells the 2005 story of Anne Dumphy who was dying of ALS and thought that Dr. Rader held positive hope for her. As it turned out, she spent $30,000 on Rader's stem cell therapy, got a stronger immune system and died of ALS anyway. As the report makes clear Rader is playing on emotions and making promise that he does not seem to deliver.<br /><br />
In a similar commentary on the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3581&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">ALS Therapy Development Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> web site, one person posted in 2004, "My Aunt had the procedure by Dr. Rader in the Dominican Republic two years ago. The procedure did help her immune system but did not stop the progression of her ALS. We feel the $ given to Dr. Rader could have been better spent."<br /><br />
And in 2005, The </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3579&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Los Angeles Times</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3"> ran a story on what they termed "unproven stem cell therapies" being marketed from clinics outside the United States. Rader was one of those who were featured in the report. He claimed to have cured early Alzheimer's, said he charges $25,000 for the first injection and $8,500 for each follow up injection and told the reporter, "I think there is a higher power. I feel that I am just simply a conduit." The <em>L.A. Times</em> also reports, "Rader, 66, said he has not published anything about his therapy because that would open him to attack from a 'conspiracy' of scientists, government authorities, pharmaceutical companies and abortion opponents."<br /><br />
Today, when you visit the Medra web site, you will find that the fetal stem cells he uses come from Eastern Europe, or at least that is his claim. You will also find nothing in the way of a scientific study or a confirmation of the validity of his work, and no endorsements from prestigious institutions or any kind. <br /><br />
So I ask myself if perhaps the entire in vitro fertilization industry has produced yet another thriving business that would never have come about had scientists never decided that they could "create" babies better than the proven method designed by God. And after three months of wondering, whatever happened to that anonymous little boy in Michigan who started me thinking about all this?<br /><br />

"School District #3" – from <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As you may recall, we have begun relating real-life stories about various school districts and their encounters with Planned Parenthood.&#160; In School District #1, the fight involved removing a Planned Parenthood “educator” from the school system and was successful over a relatively short period of time.&#160; This case highlighted some important tips on approaching a school board with one’s concerns.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">In School District #2, the fight involved the removal of a child abuse counseling program developed and implemented by Planned Parenthood.&#160; This case involved an entrenched school board and local media heavily biased toward Planned Parenthood.&#160; At one point, it seemed as though the parents had actually lost since the board eventually voted to adopt the program.&#160; However, the large public outcry forced the board to develop a school access policy which, in turn, was later used to keep pro-abortion groups out of the schools and away from the children. It also led to a greater recognition on the part of the school board of the proper role of parents in the decision process of the school. In the end, the original counseling program was eventually abandoned as well!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The next school district we will review posed a much different set of challenges to parents.&#160; In School District #3, Planned Parenthood had funded the installation of a Family Life Education program.&#160; Planned Parenthood considered this its “model” program as evidenced by it being referred to in a number of state level documents.&#160; Funding directly from the state allowed not only the installation of the program, but for a full time Family Life Education director in the school district to oversee it.&#160; In this case, obviously, there was an also an entrenched bureaucracy which the parents would have to overcome.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Several years after the program had begun, a parent with a child in fourth grade became outraged over the program and the messages it was giving to the young people of the community.&#160; She realized her child would be attending this course starting the following year and felt she had to do everything possible to protect her child and the other children in the community.&#160; This parent obtained copies of the curriculum and contacted various pro-life groups in the area for assistance.&#160; The struggle that ensued was a cooperative effort of both many individuals and several groups.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The concerned parent decided to get things started in the school district by holding an informational meeting.&#160; She set up the meeting in a local church hall and invited many other parents and every member of the school board (two of whom actually attended).&#160; The meeting opened with prayer and some singing of religious songs, and then “A Critical Look at Planned Parenthood” was shown.&#160; Finally, the discussion was turned to the specific program in the school district.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As the speakers read from the actual course material, attendees were surprised to find a number of things being taught.&#160; All were clearly opposed to the sex ed program and one school board member stated he was “shocked” by the nature and extent of the program.&#160; Attendees were eager to begin the fight to get it taken out of the school.&#160;</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The two school board members who attended the meeting were very upset at the Planned Parenthood program.&#160; They asked the Superintendent of Schools to follow-up.&#160; The Superintendent scheduled a meeting to discuss the matter with the concerned parents.&#160; In preparation for the meeting, parents prepared an analysis of the FLE program in the school.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Next month:&#160; The analysis of Planned Parenthood’s Family Life Education Program</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><strong>News</strong></font></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3"><em>Vatican official: Bishops have no choice but to refuse communion to pro-abort politicians</em><br />

Lawmakers Pursue Limited Action on Abortion, Family Planning<br /></font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3494&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/News2?abbr=daily2_&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=15376&amp;security=1201&amp;news_iv_ctrl=-1</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">National Partnership for Women and Families<br /></font></span>Antiabortion-rights groups are escalating efforts against the Freedom of Choice Act and other policies to protect abortion rights that President Obama has said he would support, the Baltimore Sun reports. "Antennas are way up in the pro-life community," according to Catholic League President Bill Donahue. As evidence, the Sun cites the massive postcard campaign against the Freedom of Choice Act -- which, if approved by Congress and signed into law, would codify Roe v. Wade and prevent states from infringing on abortion rights. The groups are organizing against FOCA, which Obama had said he would sign, despite the fact that Democrats seem inclined to hold off on pursuing the broad reproductive rights agenda feared by social conservatives. Although more abortion-rights supporters gained House and Senate positions in the 2008 elections, a large number of moderate Democrats who oppose abortion or support only incremental policy changes remain in Congress, the Sun reports. In addition, any large-scale effort to overhaul abortion policies would require expending political capital, which Obama might rather use toward promoting his economic agenda. Democratic lawmakers say that although they remain committed to overturning former President George W. Bush's policies related to abortion rights and family planning, they might postpone pursuing an expansive agenda for the time being. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a past sponsor of FOCA, said she has no plans to reintroduce the bill in the immediate future. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, added that FOCA "is not our top priority right now." Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said, "We deal in reality. You have to be pragmatic, realistic and, in the end, strategic." Keenan added that the "votes just aren't there" to enact significant changes to abortion-related policies. Instead of promoting sweeping changes to abortion and family planning policies, advocates instead are focusing on reversing Bush administration initiatives. Obama already has repealed the "Mexico City" policy, also known as the "global gag rule," which prohibited international organizations that received U.S. aid from promoting or providing abortion-related information and services. In addition, the administration is expected to rescind the HHS "conscience" rule that Bush enacted before leaving office, which allows health care workers to refuse to perform any services that violates their "religious beliefs or moral convictions," the Sun reports.<br /><br />
"Abortion Reduction Strategies" Ignore Half the Problem, Archbishop Warns<br /></font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3495&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=93585</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">EWTN<br /></font></span>During a trip to Ireland this past weekend, Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver delivered a talk to the Irish chapter of Human Life International that outlined the “dos and don’ts” for the pro-life movement. Those who claim pro-lifers should avoid the “divisive” issue of ending legalized abortion and focus on providing better support for pregnant mothers are creating a false division, the archbishop insisted. Following the theme “An American view on how to build a culture of life,” Archbishop Chaput explained that his goal was “to offer some lessons from the American experience that Irish Christians might find useful.” More than three decades after the legalization of abortion in the U.S., Archbishop Chaput diagnosed Americans’ beliefs on abortion as schizophrenic as he gave an overview of the current situation. “Most believe abortion is wrong. But most also want it legal under some limited circumstances,” he said. The consequences of holding two such divergent views are that the U.S. has “a large and well-funded abortion industry” and that a “very vigorous prolife movement” has grown up “right alongside the abortion industry,” Chaput observed. “American pro-lifers have had many setbacks. They never have enough money. They don't get treated fairly by the media. Too many of their leaders argue with each other too much of the time. But they just won't give up or die. And so they've won quite a few modest but important legal victories. Meanwhile they continue to work toward the strategic goal of overturning the 1973 Supreme Court decision.” With all of this in mind, Archbishop Chaput offered what he sees as six “don’ts” and five “dos” that pro-lifers around the world should learn from their American counterparts.<br /><br />

The irony of this relationship, however, might escape some people. I cannot see how a relationship can actually exist between people’s supposed belief in God, their apparent willingness to overlook what abortion does to children and negotiating ways to supposedly reduce the death count rather than eliminate it. I must be missing something.<br /><br />
I find it interesting that when the president discussed this proposed White House office prior to his election, he never mentioned that one of the office’s activities would be exploring ways to reduce abortion. In fact, in one particular address, </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3498&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">he told his audience</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, <br /></font></strong></p><blockquote><strong><font size="3">You know, faith based groups like East Side Community Ministry carry a particular meaning for me. Because in a way, they're what led me into public service. It was a Catholic group called The Campaign for Human Development that helped fund the work I did many years ago in Chicago to help lift up neighborhoods that were devastated by the closure of a local steel plant.</font></strong></blockquote><p><strong><font size="3">Imagine it! A Catholic group funded the work of a man who has now taken the position that he not only supports abortion unequivocally, but also believes it should be available without hindrance. This is precisely why he supports things like the Prevention First Act.<br /><br />
In that same speech, Obama outlined his plan to have the organizations and church groups that do understand the intricacies of working within the parameters of a federal grant teach those that don't, and once again, he mentioned a Catholic organization – this time, Catholic Charities.<br /><br />
Somehow, he appears to enjoy the idea of co-opting Catholic identity by aligning the word Catholic with his less-than-wholesome positions on matters like aborting little children. In case anyone thinks this reference to Catholic organizations is accidental, think again!<br /><br />
The most frightening part of that speech, though, was this line: </font></strong></p><blockquote><strong><font size="3">Every house of worship that wants to run an effective program and that's willing to abide by our constitution – from the largest mega-churches and synagogues to the smallest store-front churches and mosques – can and will have access to the information and support they need to run that program.</font></strong></blockquote><p><strong><font size="3">As a constitutional lawyer, the president knows that there are a wide variety of interpretations regarding the actual meaning of "separation of church and state." He also knows that those who favor abortion have argued for three decades or more that </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3496&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">opposition to abortion is a religious belief</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> and the government must not pander to pro-lifers for that reason. <br /><br />
I, for one, can imagine that, under Obama’s interpretation of the doctrine of separation of church and state, there would be little acceptance for those people of faith who actually define the questions regarding the act of abortion in terms that are accurate, comprehensive and relate directly to God's creative authority. My sense is that deeply faith-filled people are going to have a hard time if they and their projects choose to be part of his new program. <br /><br />
Further, if one objectively examines </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3474&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Obama's words of July 2008</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, versus what the Obama staff is saying now, "on the condition of anonymity," there is every reason to be exceedingly concerned about the fate of only God knows how many preborn children. <br /><br />
For example, the anonymous “senior White House aide” is quoted as saying that the White House wants to "change the dialogue" and search out "common-sense, common-ground approaches to difficult problems."<br /><br />
Now let me see if I can translate that for you. The idea that a mother has a constitutional right to kill or not to kill her baby as long as that baby is not born will continue to be the foundational principle for any "change" in dialogue or any conversation employing the Obama version of "common sense." After all, it's "a woman's choice." And clearly, the existence of the preborn child is a "difficult problem" that the White House Office on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships will address in ways acceptable to the president and his men.<br /><br />
There will be, without a doubt, no mention that abortion is an act with a deadly result. After all, the kind of dialogue Obama's staff is considering leaves out any discussion of right versus wrong, life versus death, personhood versus non-personhood or good versus evil. Such terms would be considered inflammatory in a White House that is working to create a new paradigm. The problem with all this is not so much that the president's spokespeople are discussing this, but that some members of the Evangelical and Catholic communities are applauding the effort.<br /><br />
All the mumbo-jumbo sickens me, because it places verbal gymnastics at the center of the subterfuge that is designed to make everybody feel good about Obama’s plans. Such gibberish leaves science and logic far behind. Why else would the director of the </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3501&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Life Cycle Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> at Catholic University&#160;tell the Washington Post, upon hearing of Obama’s efforts to appease both pro-lifers and pro-aborts, "The stars are beginning to align" in this "unique political moment." <br /><br />
What in the world does that have to do with facing the facts and dealing with the tragedy produced by 36 years of aborting little babies?<br /><br />
In my humble opinion, the “stars” that are aligning are all grisly, gruesome and ghastly. The cultural atmosphere in our nation at this moment reeks of the stench of death, as some applaud the efforts being made by the president to "change the dialogue."<br /><br />
One need only read a news report or two about abortion to discover that the new paradigm is already active. The philosophical framework underlying the paradigm is all too clear. Here are a couple of questions to help you see what I mean.<br /><br />
How can you say the state of </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3473&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">California is training midwives and physicians’ assistants to "perform 'suction aspiration' surgical abortion procedures</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">" in a way that does not translate into death for the younger patient?

How does one make the statement that a </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3493&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Utah "ban" on abortion</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;is actually going to end all abortion in the state, when the language of the bill states that abortion will continue, "in limited cases to protect the mothers' life, prevent permanent damage to her physical health, or in cases of rape or incest?" You simply don't define the word "ban," but if Merriam-Webster's definition of the word "ban" still reads, "to prohibit," then where is the truth in the description of this bill? You’ve got it … It simply is not there. <br /><br />
And yes, I am saying that there are pro-lifers who are as guilty of this game as are the pro-aborts. This is why some are applauding the Obama proposal. The political world surrounding abortion has become a discussion about abstract concepts that have nothing to do with a real baby, real blood and real death.<br />
It really frightens me when I think about the ways in which language is being so badly abused. I wonder if anyone really knows what the words they hear or read mean, or worse, if they actually care at all.<br /><br />
Is it being unfair of me to indict Obama and his latest project as being nothing more than propaganda?

By Judie Brown</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Science and technology have made enormous contributions to our lives and society. But the fact that a certain procedure is technologically possible does not make it ethically right. “In vitro” literally means “in glass.” In vitro fertilization is a process whereby human life is generated in a laboratory environment such as a glass petri dish.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The process of IVF begins when fertility technicians administer hormone treatments to a woman. The hormones hyper-stimulate the woman’s ovaries to produce a number of eggs at one time. The eggs are collected from the woman’s body and fertilized. The resulting embryos are nourished in laboratory cultures and inserted into the woman’s body with the hope that one embryo will successfully implant in the lining of the womb and develop. The process is very controlled and involves numerous trips to the IVF clinic.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The Jones Institute, one of the pioneers of IVF, reports that only 10 to 20% of the human embryos produced by IVF ever result in a normal pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that in 2003, 48,000 babies were born through IVF in the United States. This means that 240,000 – 480,000 human embryos are missing from the equation for that year alone.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">• Many embryos die in the transfer process since they are fragile.<br />
• Some embryos are unwanted and eliminated because they are considered genetically inadequate.<br />
• Some embryos are stored alive in freezers.<br />
• Some embryos are simply killed as they are washed down the sink.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">It is a scientific fact that human life begins at the first moment of biological inception. At that point, the human embryo has a complete genetic code, and his or her growth and development are totally coordinated from within. When this fundamental moral line is violated or obscured, categories of people become devalued and they become easily used for utilitarian purposes.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">No one has the “right” to a child—even the most loving of couples. IVF turns children into commodities. When a couple undergoes IVF, they are saying, “We want a child no matter what,” and the child becomes an object. This evolves into a selective mentality, whereby couples choose the kind of child they want. Above all, a child is a gift. Cooperating with God’s plan for human procreation ensures that all children are accepted as gifts. IVF is wrong because it separates human procreation from marital union.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Spousal union is expressed both spiritually and physically.&#160; And at the same time, the procreative dimension yields both spiritual benefits and physical fruits. When marriage is physically fruitful, a couple participates in God’s creative act instead of dominating it.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Once IVF is accepted, there is no substantial reason to oppose cloning. Both take human procreation out of the context of conjugal union. IVF begins the slippery slope that leads to cloning, eugenics and experimentation on human embryos.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">American Life League’s Federal Personhood Amendment is written specifically to establish the legal personhood of all human beings from the beginning of their biological development irrespective of the method of reproduction, whether in vivo or in vitro.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The Federal Personhood Amendment is unlike all other pro-life legislation in that it guarantees the right to life of ALL people from the moment of creation until natural death.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><strong>News</strong></font></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3"><em>Pro-life people must not lose heart with Obama election says Vatican archbishop</em><br />

The onset of pregnancy, marked by implantation of the blastocyst into the endometrium."</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Notice that the first definition differs markedly from the second definition, and that the second ignores conception as defined in the first and tells the reader that the actual pregnancy does not begin until eight days after it has begun—at the moment of implantation in the woman's womb! In other words, the two definitions directly contradict each other. But how many of us have gone along with the use of both definitions without realizing what was happening in the process? Now there are even states where "conception" is legally defined—erroneously—as beginning at implantation. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">At a 1959 Planned Parenthood-Population Council symposium, Swedish researcher Bent Boving noted that "the social advantage of being considered to prevent conception rather than to destroy an established pregnancy could depend upon something so simple as a prudent habit of speech."</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Obviously, the intent to deceive the public about the abortion-causing nature of anti-fertility control drugs and devices was widespread. At the 1964 Population Council symposium, Dr. Samuel Wishik pointed out that acceptance or rejection of birth control would depend on whether it causes an early abortion. Dr. Christopher Tietze, of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council, suggested, as a public relations ploy, "not to disturb those people for whom this is a question of major importance." Tietze added that theologians and jurists have always taken the prevailing biological and medical consensus of their times as factual and that "if a medical consensus develops and is maintained that pregnancy, and therefore life, begins at implantation, eventually our brethren from the other faculties will listen." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">And in 1965, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology published a new Terminology Bulletin that stated, "Conception is the implantation of the fertilized ovum." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">So, there you have it. We concluded that we could no longer say "conception" without saying "fertilization." To do otherwise was to agree with the culture of death that, since pregnancy does not begin until implantation, the child prior to implantation is simply not really there at all!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">But the plot now thickens even more. Enter the sadistic scientists who have no problem telling us that, because there are so many in vitro fertilization embryos sitting around in a freezer somewhere, they have devised a way to put them all to good use. They will use their stem cells, thus killing each of them in the process; and help us learn how to cure disease, grow extra body parts and stop the aging process, to mention but a few of their bogus claims. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Not only that, but they will manipulate human and animal cells, and in the process, clone or otherwise asexually reproduce human beings or maybe even a human-animal chimera along the way, to use their stem cells as well. Regardless of what they call it, the fact is that in today's fast-moving era of science for the sake of profit, the human being is at even greater risk. For those of us working for the pro-life cause, this means that our language has to be even more precise than it was previously.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">So, what to do? Well, at American Life League, we are doing everything we can to make sure that every human being, regardless of his point of origin, is protected by law and the Constitution. The proposed Federal Personhood Amendment that we support states, therefore, that regardless of how human beings come into existence—whether by sexual or asexual means, whether in vitro or in vivo, whether disabled or not—they are to be treated as persons, and all of the rights the Creator has bestowed on each and every person—born and preborn—are to be recognized and protected.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Clearly, the situation has changed dramatically over the past 35 years, and had I realized then what I do now, I would have been speechless and terrified. It has always been clear that many in the culture deny God because they pretend that they are themselves gods, but today that is more obvious and thus more chilling than even I could have imagined.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><font color="#000000">The Federal Personhood Amendment which American Life League supports and is working to have introduced in Congress is updated and semantically accurate.&#160; We hope you will read it carefully, adopt the language and pass it to others encouraging them to contact their elected officials seeking their support as well.</font>&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="3">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><em>Abstinence-based sex education under attack, even as study suggests condom failure<br /></em>The teen birth rate is up in 26 states, and a new study suggests condoms could fail up to one-third of the time.<br /></font></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D689%2526L%253D3354%2526F%253DH"><strong><font color="#2861b5" size="3">http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000009131.cfm</font></strong></a></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><em>HPV vaccine shot causes 500% increase in allergic reactions compared to other vaccines</em><br />

With respect to the right to life guaranteed to persons by the fifth and 14th articles of amendment to the Constitution, the word "person" applies to all human beings; irrespective of age, health, function, physical dependency or method of reproduction; including their unborn offspring; at every stage of their biological development.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><u>Section 3 <br /></u>Congress and the several States, including territories under United States control, shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><u>Section 4</u> </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Definitions:</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Human being</em>: Any organism, including the single-cell human embryo, irrespective of the method of reproduction, who possesses a genome specific for and consistent with an individual member of the human species.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Human genome</em>: The total amount of nuclear and extra-nuclear DNA genetic material that constitutes an organism as an individual member of the human species—including the single-cell human embryo.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Human embryo</em>: The term is used to define all human beings from the beginning of the embryonic period of their biological development through eight weeks; irrespective of age, health, function, physical dependency or method of reproduction; whether in vivo or in vitro.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Human fetus</em>: The term is used to define all human beings from the beginning of the fetal period of their biological development (the beginning of nine weeks) through birth; irrespective of age, health, function, physical dependency or method of reproduction; whether in vivo or in vitro.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Personhood</em>: The legal recognition of a human being's full status as a human person that applies to all human beings; irrespective of age, health, function, physical dependency or method of reproduction; including their unborn offspring; at every stage of their biological development.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The use of certain terminology must be considered with regard to human reproduction. The common terms used to refer to the moment that a human being's life begins are "fertilization" and "conception." We encourage you to reconsider the use of these terms for the following reasons.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Fertilization is now only one method of reproducing members of the human species. It is a medically accurate term but not sufficient, because humans are now also created artificially, that is, by asexual means not involving fertilization. To use the term "fertilization" when referring to the moment that a new human being comes into existence would consequently exclude from this document's intended scope a whole class of people who are reproduced asexually. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Although "conception" is commonly used by the general public, it is expressly and universally rejected as a scientific term by embryologists, scientists and medical professionals, and thus does not adequately support the concept of personhood. In addition, the term is not always understood to refer to the act of fertilization and is often erroneously taken to mean “implantation.” In many states, as well as in literally dozens of national and international medical and research organizations (including the American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians), the term "conception" is defined as "beginning at implantation." ACOG adopted this new definition in 1965 in response to political pressures and not as a result of scientific discovery.&#160; Thus, since the personhood movement aims to recognize all human beings, precise, unambiguous and scientifically accurate terminology is indispensable and of the utmost importance.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Instead of using the aforementioned terms, use the term point of creation instead of conception, or even fertilization. If explaining when a person comes into existence, explain that human embryology experts recognize that the life of each human being begins at his or her biological beginning or biological inception.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><u><em><strong><font size="3">The Federal Personhood Amendment is unlike all other pro-life legislation in that it guarantees the right to life of ALL people from the moment of creation until natural death.</font></strong></em></u></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="3">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Study links water pollution from contraceptives, chemicals with declining male fertility<br /></em>New research strengthens the link between water pollution and rising male fertility problems.

Study Links Water Pollution from Contraceptives, Chemicals with Declining Male Fertility<br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3344%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/jan/09011901.html</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">Life Site News <br /></font></span>New research strengthens the link between water pollution and rising male fertility problems. The study, by Brunel University, the Universities of Exeter and Reading and the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, shows for the first time how a group of testosterone-blocking chemicals is finding its way into UK rivers, affecting wildlife and potentially humans. The research was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council and is now published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. The study identified a new group of chemicals that act as ‘anti-androgens.’ This means that they inhibit the function of the male hormone, testosterone, reducing male fertility. Some of these are contained in medicines, including cancer treatments, pharmaceutical treatments, and pesticides used in agriculture. The research suggests that when they get into the water system, these chemicals may play a pivotal role in causing feminising effects in male fish. Earlier research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter has shown how female sex hormones (estrogens), and chemicals that mimic estrogens, are leading to ‘feminisation’ of male fish. Found in some industrial chemicals and the contraceptive pill, they enter rivers via sewage treatment works. This causes reproductive problems by reducing fish breeding capability and in some cases can lead to male fish changing sex. Other studies have also suggested that there may be a link between this phenomenon and the increase in human male fertility problems caused by testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Until now, this link lacked credence because the list of suspects causing effects in fish was limited to estrogenic chemicals whilst testicular dysgenesis is known to be caused by exposure to a range of anti-androgens. <br /><br /><font color="#ff0000"><em>ALL Report</em>: "FOCA in Focus"</font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3"><span>American Life League explains the dangers of the Freedom of Choice Act for preborn babies throughout the country. </span><br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To view the report on </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D2936%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">blip.tv</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> (higher quality version), go to&#160;</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3238%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://blip.tv/file/1650006</font></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D2875%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">.</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;To watch the video on YouTube (please understand, we can't control the related content there), go to </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3240%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=347F1aHx5yg</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. <br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the <em>ALL Report</em> through an RSS feed, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D1834%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://allreport.blip.tv/rss</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the <em>ALL Report</em> via iTunes, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank"><strong><font size="3">itpc://ALLReport.blip.tv/rss/itunes/</font></strong></a><strong><font size="1"><font size="3"> <br /></font><br /></font></strong><strong><font size="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Register now!&#160; The 25th Anniversary of the Baby Doe Rules: Perspectives from the Fields of Law, Health Care, Ethics and Disability Policy</span><br /></font></strong></span></font></span></span></font><u><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="1">FEATURE STORY</font></strong></u></span><strong><font size="1"> </font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;<strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">ALL Associate Newsletter</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;P</font><font size="4">ro-Life Today | 15 January 2009</font></strong></p><p><em><strong><font size="3"><u>Your National Daily News Wrap from American Life League!</u> American Life League is the largest grassroots pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.

In its largest-ever state-based initiative, the Family Research Council is contacting every state lawmaker in the country with a plea to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, one of the nation's largest providers of family planning and abortion services.&#160; Their argument is fairly simple: lots of organizations need public money now, but Planned Parenthood -- with a $1 billion budget and a $114 million operating surplus -- isn't one of them. "Planned Parenthood has proven that they don't need federal or state handouts," says Tom McClusky, vice president for government affairs at the Washington-based FRC. "During these economic times, when states are rethinking their investments, subsidizing abortion is probably not the kind of thing that they want to be known for."<br /><br />

Otherwise, we will be the unmistakably cowardly who, by our silence and tolerance, permitted our foes to pursue their ongoing effort to deceive, corrupt and otherwise mold the culture into one based on hatred for God’s gift of life.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Judie Brown is president of American Life League and a member of the Pontifical Academy for Life.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D667%2526L%253D3308%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">Respond to Judie<br />

By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As you may recall, we have begun relating real-life stories about various school districts and their encounters with Planned Parenthood.&#160;With School District #1, the fight involved removing a Planned Parenthood “educator” from the school system and was successful over a relatively short period of time.&#160;This case highlighted some important tips on approaching a school board with one’s concerns.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">With School District #2, the fight involved the removal of a child abuse counseling program developed and to be implemented by Planned Parenthood.&#160;The parents in this case were facing an entrenched school board and the local media were heavily on the side of Planned Parenthood.&#160;At one point, it seemed as though the parents had actually lost since the board eventually voted to adopt the program.&#160;However, this case is a prime example of how God rewards faithful efforts and creates victory out of apparent defeat.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The parents in School District #2 used letters-to-the-editor to arouse community support and solicited the help of their own children to show that the community did not want Planned Parenthood in the schools.&#160;Despite the board’s vote, the large public outcry forced the board to develop a school access policy which included the concerns of parent leaders.&#160;It also led to a greater recognition on the part of the school board of the proper role of parents in the decision process of the school. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Approximately three years after the fight over the child abuse counseling program, the parents scored another tremendous victory against the pro-abortion forces.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">During that time, a state commission tried to get local groups to sponsor education programs that would bring attention to the U.S. Constitution.&#160;A small group of people in this school district, who apparently were pro-abortion, saw this as a chance to bring attention to the abortion issue and to get children in the local schools to write pro-abortion essays.&#160;To accomplish this, they received a $1,000 grant and developed an essay contest.&#160;The essays could be written on one of two topics:&#160;“Non-Partisan vs. Partisan Elections in Village and Town” or “Reproductive Rights.”&#160;The guide for the “Reproductive Rights” essay was a five page “fact” sheet.&#160;All of the sources for the fact sheet information, it was noted, were either Planned Parenthood or organizations, literature or research groups that were, in fact, pro-death!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As the pro-abortion people hatched their plan, they were shocked to find that they could not get access to the public schools.&#160;Because of the previously agreed Access Policy, these people did not qualify and could not get to the kids through the schools!&#160;They were, of course, outraged, but could do nothing about it.&#160;And, without access to the children, the pro-abortion plans began to fall apart. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">They did go ahead with the essay contest and announced the winner at a town meeting.&#160;The announcement was given little fanfare or attention – no mention of the title or the contents – either at the meeting or in the local newspaper.&#160;But, it was available at the library – “HUMAN LIFE AND PERSONHOOD.”&#160;Yes, it was definitely a pro-life essay!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Thus, the parents who fought the child abuse counseling program not only won all they sought, but the results of their victories were being felt several years later.&#160;This series of events points out a number of additional things which can be done by people who are fighting school programs:</font></strong></p><ol><li><strong><font size="3">If the school board will not listen to you, do not be afraid to go directly to the community.&#160;Use the letters-to-the-editor column in your local papers to ask pertinent questions and to bring what is going on in the schools to the attention of the community. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">Respond to the arguments of your adversaries on issues that affect the community.&#160;Get the students involved when appropriate and spread the message to an objection of Planned Parenthood in general, not just the specific program involved. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">If you are presented with opportunities to have an effect on school policy (such as with an Access Policy), take them.&#160;You never know when they will be beneficial to your goals. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">Finally, the most important point for any fight against the school, don’t count your victories and losses by the vote of the school board.&#160;Your job is NOT to win school board votes – your job is to proclaim the truth.&#160;The task at hand is to rouse the people of the community and to get them out to the school board meeting, get them to write letters and sign petitions – to get the community involved.&#160;If you have done this, you have won regardless of how the school board votes. </font></strong></li></ol><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Too many people judge their success or failure by the outcome of the vote.&#160;This is what Planned Parenthood does and they understand it completely.&#160;What they do not understand is, people who lose the school board vote and still fight as strong as ever.&#160;They don’t understand this unselfish dedication on the part of parents for no apparent material gain.&#160;And, since they don’t understand it, they cannot fight it.&#160;They are helpless against truly dedicated parents who simply will not give up. So, don’t give up. Keep fighting and God will win!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><font color="#ff0000" size="5"><strong>News</strong></font></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font color="#ff0000" size="3">Vatican newspaper publishes article detailing birth control pill as cause of abortion and cancer</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The Vatican’s official newspaper has caused a media storm in the European press with an article asserting the abortifacient and carcinogenic effects of hormonal contraceptives. <br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3179%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/jan/09010504.html</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><em><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><strong>Birth-control pill is linked to male infertility, says Vatican paper</strong></font></em></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The birth-control pill is causing "devastating" environmental damage and plays a role in rising male infertility rates, said the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano.<br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3260%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900033.htm</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font color="#ff0000" size="3">Merck seeks FDA approval for HPV vaccine use in boys, young men</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Merck is seeking FDA approval for the use of its human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil, for boys and young men ages nine to 26. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3178%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/News2?abbr=daily2_&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=14679&amp;security=1201&amp;news_iv_ctrl=-1</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font size="3">Parish’s big victories</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">When pro-life messages and actions are consistent and regular, pro-life fruits are sweet and abundant. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3259%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/16803/</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font size="3">Mother has healthy baby boy despite abortion warning by doctor</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Gaynor Purdy was warned her first child could have a fatal chromosome defect and a life threatening heart condition.

Executives at Planned Parenthood confirmed the layoffs, but declined to give more details. “As with many other nonprofit organizations, Planned Parenthood has had to make staff reductions at our headquarters due to the challenging economic times facing our country,” said Maryana Iskander, chief operating officer at the agency. “While taking this action is never easy, we want to ensure the millions of women and men who rely on Planned Parenthood as a health care provider that the reductions will not impact our ability to deliver care to those in need.” Part of Planned Parenthood’s funding declines stem from the closing of the Florida-based Picower Foundation, which shut down in December because its assets were managed by Bernard Madoff. The $1 billion foundation was one of the few major funders of reproductive rights issues.<br /><br />

The focus is on enlightening journalists on health issues that plague blacks, such as mental health issues from incarceration, heart disease, breast cancer, strokes, HIV/AIDS and childhood obesity. No mention of a procedure that ends one out of every three black pregnancies? According to the Guttmacher Institute, which compiles reproductive health statistics, black women abort their children at five times the white rate and twice the Hispanic rate. The rate is 11 abortions per 1,000 white women, 28 for every 1,000 Hispanic women and 50 for every 1,000 black women. I contacted the NABJ and asked why there was not at least one workshop on this topic. Everyone knows abortion is connected to health care. <br /><br />

The Austrian chemist was one of three whose formulation of the synthetic progestogen Norethisterone marked a key step toward the earliest oral contraceptive pill.&#160;Djerassi outlined the "horror scenario" that occurred because of the population imbalance, for which his invention was partly to blame.

This opened the door to Big Pharma when, in 1992, the State began mandating an improperly tested venereal-disease vaccine, HepB, for neonates. Big Pharma neglected to inform mom and dad that one commonly gets HepB from sexual contact with a vector. The Imperial State now mandates yet another improperly tested STD vaccine, HPV, to allegedly protect "tweens" from cervical cancer.&#160;&#160;"Follow the money." No moral society finds STDs rife among its chaste or its children.

It should come as no surprise that Planned Parenthood, the largest supporter of unrestricted abortion, praised the bill. And why not? The abortion merchant will likely be the largest beneficiary of Reid's abortion bailout.&#160;Among other things, the legislation would use taxpayer funds to mislead people about the potential of the "morning after pill" (known as Plan B) to act as an abortifacient. It also encourages the use of Plan B for victims of sexual assault yet has no reporting requirement in place for young girls who may have been victims of abuse and/or rape. When you get right down to it, the bill does nothing to support parental involvement--let alone consent--for dispensing the morning after pill and other "contraception" to minors.&#160;In addition to funding Plan B, the measure would also: subsidize birth control for college and low-income women; expand Title X, the main federal family planning program that requires abortion referrals; expand Planned Parenthood targeting of low-income women through Medicaid; target teens' with "comprehensive" sex education; and spread emergency contraception.<br /><br /><font color="#800000">ALL Report: FOCA in Focus</font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3"><span>American Life League explains the dangers of the Freedom of Choice Act for preborn babies throughout the country. </span><br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To view the report on </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D2936%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">blip.tv</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> (higher quality version), go to&#160;</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D3238%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://blip.tv/file/1650006</font></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D2875%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">.</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;To watch the video on YouTube (please understand, we can't control the related content there), go to </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D3240%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=347F1aHx5yg</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. <br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the ALL Report through an RSS feed, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D1834%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://allreport.blip.tv/rss</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the ALL Report via iTunes, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank"><strong><font size="3">itpc://ALLReport.blip.tv/rss/itunes/</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> </font></strong></span></font></span></span><br /></font></span></p><p><u style="font-size: 14pt"><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="3">FEATURE STORY</font></strong></u></p><p><strong><font size="3">THE GRAMMAR OF RIGHT THINKING<br /></font></strong><em><strong><font size="3">By Judie Brown<br /><br /></font></strong></em></p><p><strong><font size="3">Not a day passes&#160;without one headline or another grabbing my attention and riveting me to a search engine on my computer, sort of like a mad dog! &#160;But I learned that one of the best ways to share the undeniable truths that are not yours or mine, but God’s, is to focus on those aspects of daily life that prompt us to think about what kind of people we are.

Yet also, and this is the crucial point, because of an overwhelming and isolating sense of shame. Almost from the moment I awoke from the anesthetic, I have deeply regretted my decision.

But instead of getting her Christmas miracle, a healthy baby boy named Bashir, Moore's son was stillborn. Devastated, the young mother left her baby's remains in the care of the hospital and went home. When she came back to claim him, the hospital couldn't find his body. That's right, you heard me, the Christ Hospital claimed it couldn't find Bashir. ..&#160;<br />

How does a hospital lose an infant's body?&#160;<br />

If that wasn't bad enough, Moore says police told her that her son had accidentally been thrown in the trash; tossed away like garbage. How in the world could that happen?

Apparently, not because now officials are searching dumps in New Jersey and Pennsylvania looking for Bashir's remains. <br />

The right to life and to the free expression of personal faith in God is not subject to the power of man.

Pedro Jose Maria Simon Castellvi, President of the International Federation of Catholic Medical Associations (FIAMC), writes that "we have sufficient data to affirm that one of the reasons for the not insignificant rise in male infertility in the west (due to increasingly fewer sperm in men), is the environmental contamination caused by 'the pill'." "We are confronted with a clear anti-ecological effect that demands further explanation from the manufacturers," continued Castellvi, who also noted that the abortifacient and carcinogenic effects of the contraceptive pill are also well known. Castellvi's statements echo similar utterances made by numerous other medical and scientific experts since 2004.&#160; Female hormones from birth control pills, which enter the water supply through urination, are being blamed for declining sperm counts in human and animal populations, the growth of female sex organs in male fish, breast growth in young men, and early onset of puberty in young girls.&#160;<br /><br />

In the letter, ADF lawyer Thomas Bowman wrote that "[m]any ... employees" believe that performing abortion procedures at the center would "severely upset regular patients, disrupt the respected surgical practice that currently occurs there, decimate employee morale, require burdensome policy changes and compel direct or indirect staff participation" in the procedures.

When their 55-page report to Obama calls for an end to “ideologically driven government restrictions,” it really means that the government should be paying more of the bills for groups that advocate and perform abortions. To provide some context, the government has been “bailing out” Big Abortion for years. Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, feeds off the taxpayer to the tune of $337 million in government funds that would otherwise have to come from donors. If the recommendations in this report are enacted, they and other abortion providers and advocates will have even more spoils upon which to feast.<br /><br />

The regulation is quite clear and states,&#160;</font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font size="3">(e) Entities to whom this paragraph (e) applies shall not, on the basis that the individual or entity has received a grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee under the Public Health Service Act, the <br />

&#160; (1) Such individual to perform or assist in the performance of any sterilization procedure or abortion if his performance or assistance in the performance of such procedure or abortion would be contrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions, or<br />

Thus the federal government found it necessary to make clear its intentions not to upset the hedonistic family-planning giant. In fact, </font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3203%2526F%253DH"><font size="3">Health and Human Services</font></a><font size="3"> was quite specific, stating,&#160;&#160;</font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font size="3">After the full consideration of Comments on this issue [a clear definition of abortion], the Department declines to add a definition of abortion to the rule. As indicated by the Comments, such questions over the nature of abortion and the ending of a life are highly controversial and strongly debated. The Department believes it can enforce the federal health care conscience protection laws without an abortion definition just as the Department has enforced Hyde Amendment, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, Div. G, Sec. Sec. 507, 508(a)-(c), 121 Stat. 1844, 2208 (Dec. 26, 2007), abortion funding restrictions without a formal definition. Additionally, nothing in this rule alters the obligation of federal Title X programs to deliver contraceptive services to clients in need as authorized by law and regulation.&#160;</font></p><p><font size="3">In other words, the new regulation honors the conscientious objection of those who, because of religious belief or moral conviction, will not participate in medical or surgical abortion, and the regulation obviously provides the same protection for those who do perform such procedures. There is nothing ostensibly pro-life in the regulation.<br /><br />
Thus the regulation is pabulum, pure and simple, hiding behind words like "controversial" and "strongly debated" rather than defining that a human being begins at his beginning and therefore some forms of contraception are in fact abortive. Chicken Little lives. But not so, according to commentaries in leading newspapers, including the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3195%2526F%253DH">St. Louis Post Dispatch</a></em>, which editorialized, "Under the rule, pharmacists are allowed to refuse to fill a prescription for contraceptives or for medications associated with medical abortion. A doctor can refuse to tell a pregnant patient about the availability of abortion even if the patient asks about it and even if a continued pregnancy threatens the patient's&#160;life."&#160;<br /><br />
Given the fact that the rule does not define abortion and insists that recipients of Title X funding must provide contraceptive services, I have to ask if the Post Dispatch editorial writer(s) actually read the regulation or merely chose to make wild claims about aspects of the regulation that are either nonexistent or watered down to the point of being meaningless. <br /><br />
Of course, a more plausible explanation for this disingenuous attack is that the <em>Post-Dispatch</em> and its ilk are laying the groundwork for the Obama administration to employ the same arguments, in order to overturn the regulation.That is just the sort of trickery that likely future HHS secretary </font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3153%2526F%253DH"><font size="3">Tom Daschle</font></a><font size="3">&#160; is good at, as we all know.</font></p><p><br /><font size="3">As </font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3196%2526F%253DH"><font size="3">Nancy Valko</font></a><font size="3">, RN, said in her letter to the editor of the St. Louis newspaper,&#160;&#160;</font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font size="3">As a registered nurse for almost 40 years, I am shocked that the editorial "Unconscionable" (Dec. 24) would suggest that doctors, nurses and pharmacists with ethical objections to participating in certain procedures or treatments just "choose another profession."

I have a feeling I know the answer. They want a policy that basically states that&#160;nobody in the healthcare profession who is committed to defending and protecting innocent human persons need apply! There is no other possible conclusion! When so much protest can be raised over the simple matter of making certain that freedom of conscience applies equally across the board to those who will kill as well as those who will not kill, something is drastically wrong. <br /><br />
The problem is that too few see the rising tide of morbid ideology that underlies commentaries such as that published by the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>. One hopes that this situation will change before it is too late. If it does not, eventually the circus could turn into a spectacle at which people of conviction are fed to bloodthirsty lions.

Robert G. Marshall and Jim Sedlak</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">As we mentioned in last week’s newsletter, one of the aims of the Prevention First Act is to make Title X, or family planning, a permanent government program and fund it at $700 million or more. Many people wonder precisely what Title X is and what it does. Here we begin a series to answer those questions:</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Title X is a government program, contained in the authorization and appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services. It is a “family planning” program that has become the source of various projects for the dispensation of birth control, referral for abortion and promotion of in-school and on-campus sex education programs and school-based clinics.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Title X of the Public Health Service Act was passed first in 1970 and was called Tydings Act. The argument in 1970 for passing this bill was that the bill was needed to “reduce the number of illegitimate births and the medical and psychological complications for both mother and child often resulting from them.” (According to the Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, the rates of out-of-wedlock births among teenage girls ages 15-19 has only increased since the passage of this Act!)</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">The recipients of Title X funds include state health departments, affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and other facilities that provide birth control counseling, birth control devices, health education services and sex education. School-based clinics and off-campus clinics designed to provide counseling on matters relating to reproductive health, also receive funding from Title X.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Is there really a connection between Title X and abortion? There is. The program funds abortion – thousands of abortions. Title X provides funding for chemical abortions as well as funding for organizations that promote abortion.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Frank Susman, the lawyer who represented the pro-abortion position before the U.S. Supreme Court, stated in oral argument:</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal" align="center"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">For better or for worse, there no longer exists any bright line between the fundamental right that was established in <em>Griswold</em> and the fundamental right of abortion that was established in <em>Roe</em>. These two rights, because of advances in medicine and science, now overlap. They coalesce and merge and they are not distinct. The most common forms of contraception today – IUDs, low-dose birth prevention pills … act as abortifacients.</span></font></font></p><p style="line-height: normal" align="center"><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">An abortifacient is a chemical or a device that causes abortion in the first days or weeks of a human being’s life in the womb. Title X provides funding for the provision of these birth control methods that act, at least partially, to abort. Therefore, Title X does fund abortion.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Additionally, it is a well-documented fact that organizations such as the affiliates of Planned Parenthood specialize in referring for abortion, have abortionists on staff in many locations and are promoters of abortion as an antidote to “unwanted” pregnancy. Therefore the money that these organizations get from the federal government can be used to offset expenditures for surgical abortion and abortion counseling.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Since its inception in 1970, Title X of the Health and Human Services Act has always been a major funding source for Planned Parenthood. Title X was funded at $300 million for fiscal year 2008. Planned Parenthood receives about 25 percent of the total, or $75 million. Thus, the PFA would more than double the tax dollars given to Planned Parenthood ($175 million) by this one program – in addition to making Title X permanent.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">&#160;&#160;</font></p><h1><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#ff0000" size="3">News</font></span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Pro-abortion med student shrinks away from practice after “disturbingly brutal” procedure</font></span></em></p><p style="background: white" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">Though she had practiced the procedure as a student at the University of Maryland School of Medicine by scraping out a piece of fruit with razor-sharp abortion instruments, Lesley Wojcik learned that her training could never have prepared her for a real abortion.

I, Sec. 6 of the Texas Constitution, which bars giving preference by law to a religion.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/nov/08112703.html">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/nov/08112703.html</a></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font color="#ff0000" size="3">Closing Thought</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way.

These components include:</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal" align="center"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span></font><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">• Making Title X (family planning) a permanent program and funding it at $700 million or more. Since its inception in 1970, Title X of the Health and Human Services Act has always been a major funding source for PP. However, Title X is not a permanent program and must be reauthorized every year. Title X was funded at $300 million for fiscal year 2008. PP receives about 25 percent of the total or $75 million. Thus, the PFA would more than double the tax dollars given to PP ($175 million) by this one program. It would also make Title X a permanent program.</span></font></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in" align="center">&#160;</p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">• Mandating that health insurance programs that cover prescriptions also cover abortifacient contraceptives. The PFA would take away the ability of consumers and insurance companies to seek the coverage they want and would force every insurance plan that covers prescription drugs to pay for birth control. </font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">• Creating a government program to push abortifacient “emergency contraception.” The PFA would create a government-funded five-year “educational” program to promote emergency contraception and drive even more Plan B business to PP.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span></font><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">• Taking all federal money away from any hospital that refuses to administer emergency contraception (an abortifacient), to rape victims. In addition, it would require that every hospital, even Catholic, Baptist and others opposed to abortion for religious reasons, MUST provide patients with emergency contraception or lose all of their federal funding.</span></font></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">• Creating additional massive government funding for PP-style sex education programs (abstinence-only programs are specifically excluded from funding). Under the subprogram named “At-Risk Communities Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act,” the PFA would create a program to conduct research and educational sessions for the purpose of reducing teen pregnancy. All kinds of organizations (e.g. Planned Parenthood) would receive taxpayer funds, and all kinds of theories and ways of preventing teen pregnancy could be researched and taught EXCEPT abstinence-only programs. </span></font></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">• Permanently including family planning services as part of the Medicaid program. The Medicaid program was never intended to pay for family planning services. Yet, beginning in the 1990s, states started applying for Medicaid waivers to allow them to add family planning for Medicaid-eligible recipients. The federal government has approved these waivers, and their approval must be renewed, on a state-by-state basis, every five years. Because of the waivers, Medicaid is now the largest single program providing taxpayer money for PP. The PFA would do away with the need for waivers and write family planning services permanently into Medicaid, thereby opening the floodgates of taxpayer funding for PP even wider.</span></font></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">&#160;</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><em><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font style="background-color: #ffffff" size="3">What is the status of the Prevention First Act?</font></span></em><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><br /><br /><font size="3">It is important to note that the election ushers in a new Congress in January.

This is one of four rules that the congressman not only shared with his political peers, but with pro-life Americans as well. As a Catholic leader, Hyde knew that Catholic teaching does not admit compromise when addressing fundamental truths concerning abortion and the attack on marriage. Hyde rarely had a problem focusing on the nonnegotiable teaching that an act of abortion was never acceptable. His leadership was based on that principle. <br /><br />
Principles, particularly for the God-fearing person, do not change and in fact actually formulate the kind of person we are individually and the kind of culture we strive to nurture and protect collectively. But what happens when there is a flaw in the fabric of principle, a misstep in the defense of never-changing truths?<br /><br />

In his January 10 blog post, he shares the facts about something that happened in Canada regarding same-sex marriage, and it reminded me of what could happen when Obama is sworn in, in a few short days, and starts dealing with abortion. While we are here discussing same-sex marriage in Canada and abortion in America, the scenarios of how the two nations arrived at their current juncture are quite similar.&#160;Here is what Mark wrote:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">I would like to bring readers’ attention to a special reprint of an article entitled "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D661%2526L%253D3268%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">The conspiracy to abolish marriage in Canada</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">: If everything is marriage, then nothing is."&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
When recognition of same-sex marriage was rammed through Canada's Parliament under the Liberal government of Paul Martin, it was not supported as a free vote. Prime Minister Martin invoked strict Party discipline in order to pass the bill. All ministers, parliamentary secretaries and committee Chairs (not to mention back bench MPs) were expected to support the same-sex marriage bill, under threat of losing portfolios, perks, and privileges. Self-interest prevailed for most Liberal MPs: all but a few courageous Members fell into line and voted to recognize homosexual marriage. <br />
&#160;<br />
Was this departure from historical definition of marriage – as between one man and one woman – warranted by stacks of social science or empirical studies validating the advisability of such a change? No. In fact, there were studies showing that children raised in homosexual partner homes have considerable problems. Quite simply, the law was changed on the basis of liberal social fashion (disguised as human rights). <br />
&#160;<br />
Recognition of same-sex marriage (in Canada and abroad) is a deviation from history and wisdom of the ages. It is a dangerous social experiment that threatens to bring down Christian civilization that previous generations fought to preserve. <br />
&#160;<br />
Two major pillars of Christian morality are marriage and the sanctity of human life. Both are being supplanted by secularism, relativism and a neo-paganism. The result has been disastrous to the Christian concept of life's sanctity. Now the marriage pillar is being torn down. Like the article noted at the beginning of this blog says in its title, "If everything is marriage, then nothing is." A primary building block of society will disappear.<br /><br />
Sadly, the dismantling of our [formerly] Christian country has been aided by Christians themselves. So often the Canadian Evangelical response to the destruction of the sanctity of human life ethic has been pale and uncertain.<br /><br />
Now, with the redefinition of marriage, Canadian Evangelicals seem to have thrown up their hands as though the matter was decided. It may have been decided by our liberal courts and political elites, but it has not been decided by ordinary people on main street Canada. They are looking for leadership back to sanity. <br /><br />
Evangelicals seem to have shrunk away with embarrassment from standing resolutely and forcefully against the destruction of traditional marriage by a vociferous and litigious homosexual lobby. Protection of their church charitable status is more important than speaking out against redefinition of marriage or homosexuality. They are afraid of being called names, maligned by the press, or being dragged before a quasi-judicial human rights tribunal. <br />
&#160;<br />
Perhaps I should not be surprised. Canadian Evangelicals have been slow and uncertain to respond against the holocaust of abortion throughout the past 40 years in Canada. I can only presume it [their response] will be equally pale and uncertain with euthanasia. There are courageous exceptions, of course, like the late Pastor Ken Campbell, and the Pentecostal Church, but they are the exceptions.<br /><br />
Denominational policy statements decrying the evil of abortion without persistent and consistent public action, or clearly articulating Biblical and Christian answers outside the church foyer, have failed the sacred cause of life. Will [Evangelicals] be equally timid to make their presence felt defending the Biblical definition of marriage? <br />
&#160;<br />
But timidity has not been the greatest failure of the Evangelical Church; its greatest failure has been accommodation. Rather than transforming the culture with Biblical truth, it has been guilty of accommodating the culture and that ultimately denies the transforming power of Biblical truth.<br /><br />

He addressed this spirit of accommodation: “For the evangelical accommodation to the world of our age represents the removal of the last barrier against the breakdown of our culture. ... To accommodate to the world spirit about us in our age is the most gross form of worldliness in the proper definition of the word.” (p. 141-142) &#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
The great man said the only legitimate response for Christians is confronting the culture –&#160; loving confrontation – but confrontation nonetheless in the crucial moral and social issues of our day. Anything less is a failure to live under the full authority of God's inerrant Word: the Bible. <br />
&#160;<br />
Many Evangelicals avoided <em>The Great Evangelical Disaster</em>. Its truth was also a confrontation – a confrontation many evangelicals are still not willing to admit.<br /><br />
I call upon Canadian Evangelicals to join together with their Catholic brothers and sisters in Christ and spill into the streets in unshakable resolve to reclaim our dying Christian culture. Militate for Biblical morality on the sanctity and dignity of marriage and human life.<br /><br />
Don't worry about being dragged before human rights commissions on bogus charges, losing your tax status or being called names. Previous generations of Christians faced more serious threats for the sake of Biblical truth.<br /><br />
We are in a spiritual war of monumental proportions!&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Mark was an Evangelical prior to converting to Catholicism, and so he understands the Evangelical mindset quite well. The challenge he sets forth in his commentary should not go unnoticed, because we in America, when writing about Catholics and the question of whether or not it is acceptable to murder a preborn child by an act of abortion, are facing precisely the same kind of moral relativism. Lest we forget, Obama is going to be sworn in, in just a few days, in no small measure because more than 50 percent of Catholics cast their vote for him. <br /><br />
Dr. Schaeffer defined such an action as "accommodation to the world." </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D661%2526L%253D3264%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">Pope Benedict XVI</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> has defined it as moral relativism, and he has warned repeatedly of its devastating consequences. In fact, the Holy Father has said, "We are moving toward <em>a dictatorship of relativism</em> that recognizes nothing definite and leaves only one's own ego and one's own desires as the final measure." I would simply call it an exhibition of the greatest act of denying God ever in the history of mankind.<br /><br />
Even though Catholics and, in fact, all Christians, are not called to accommodate evil but rather to expose it and struggle against it for as long as the situation requires, it is painfully clear that this is not happening.<br /><br />
We are indeed in a spiritual war of enormous proportions. This is not a war against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers.

In fact, however, its clinical trials never tested for preventing cervical cancer. The vaccine was tested for preventing pre cancerous lesions associated with two strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted disease. Since these lesions can take 12 to 20 years to develop into cervical cancer and the clinical trials lasted less than five years, medical experts warn that the jury is still out on what impact this vaccine might have on cervical cancer rates. The results of Merck's clinical trials showed the efficacy of the vaccine was "modest," even for preventing pre cancerous lesions, among a general population of young women, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. This might have been enough to kill the idea of mass inoculations with the vaccine had Merck released its final clinical trial data to peer reviewed journals in a timely fashion. Instead, it launched three ad and marketing campaigns that fostered the false impression that this vaccine had been proven to prevent cervical cancer along with a public relations blitz that stretched from California to Paris and involved payments to journalists. Only then, after the Food and Drug Administration had approved the drug, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended it for broad use, and questions grew in the press as to why this "miracle breakthrough" had not been peer reviewed, did Merck finally release its late phase trial data. Eleven and twelve year old girls, the very target of proposed mandatory vaccination by Merck, were never tested at all for efficacy in pre-licensing clinical trials. Merck simply decided that the bodies of prepubescent girls would react the same as mature women to the vaccine. The FDA was fully aware of this when they licensed the vaccine for potentially millions of prepubescent girls, requiring only that post licensing studies be done for efficacy and safety on these children after they were injected with the drug.<br /><br />

Betty Cockrum, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, is the guest speaker at the League of Women Voters’ “Lunch with the League” event.&#160; Typically the monthly event is held in the Rockne Room of the South Bend Chocolate Cafe.

The group’s image as a provider of abortions led customers to complain by phone to South Bend Chocolate Co. owner Mark Tarner, he said today.&#160; Calls came largely from women, Tarner said, including people associated with the University of Notre Dame and out-of-town customers.

And indeed, it is a crisis, though the media does not see it that way.<br /><br />
In November of last year, USA Today reported on a study released by the prestigious Pediatrics medical journal. Pointing out that sex on television could be a leading cause for the escalating rates of adolescent sexual activity, the study </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3243%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>reported</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,&#160;</strong></font></p><blockquote><font size="3"><strong>By age 16, teens who watched a lot of sexually charged TV were more than twice as likely to be pregnant or father an out-of-wedlock baby as teens who watched very little: 12% vs. 5%.

That's the norm.' " </strong></font></p><p><font size="3"><strong>The real problem with Walsh’s observation is not that a parent is or is not talking to his or her children about sex, but rather that there is an enormous amount of unsupervised time being spent by kids who watch television because it has become the national babysitter. The parents are not only not discussing matters of life and death with their children; they are not even there to participate in a healthy discussion in the first place, or to monitor what is being viewed. The last time I checked, it was parents who had the responsibility of raising children, not the sex education teacher–TV set–video game combo that seems to prevail in much of the nation these days.<br /><br />
Clearly, there are many who argue, correctly, that if these teens had been exposed to a bit of abstinence education in their high school or middle school curriculum, they might have been spared the experience of a pregnancy, or even worse, a collaborative effort to hide the problem by having the baby killed by abortion. Concerned Parents Report has published </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.concernedparents.com%252FAbstracts%252FWhat%2527s%252520Working%252FSince%25252090%2527s%252520less%252520sex.htm"><font size="3"><strong>one such document</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>. <br /><br />
But, I daresay, abstinence education these days isn’t even a band-aid for the problem our children are facing. There is much, much more at risk than simply an untimely pregnancy.<br /><br />
Just a few days ago, Pedro Jose Maria Simon Castellvi, president of the International Federation of Catholic Medical Associations, startled the world by </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnews.yahoo.com%252Fs%252Fafp%252F20090103%252Fhl_afp%252Fvaticanreligioncontraception_090103212901%2522"><font size="3"><strong>stating</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,&#160;"We have sufficient evidence to state that a non-negligible cause of male infertility in the West is the environmental pollution caused by the pill. …We are faced with a clear anti-environmental effect which demands more explanation on the part of the manufacturers."<br /><br />
Pardon me for suggesting that the world was shocked by Castellvi’s statement. Actually, the news media dismissed this report out of hand and quoted other “experts” to debunk the comment. However, this is not the first such report on the pollution caused by millions of women ingesting artificial hormones and, whether or not the national news media reports it, the body of evidence is bound to increase.<br /><br />
Further, on the same day, Castellvi had another report published in the Vatican’s official newspaper, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em>, asserting the abortifacient and carcinogenic effects of hormonal contraception. </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3179%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>He wrote</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,&#160;"The means of contraception violate at least five important rights: the right to life, the right to health, the right to education, all right to information (their spread is at the expense of information on natural resources) and the right to equality between the sexes (the burden of contraception falls mostly on women)."</strong></font></p><p><font size="3"><strong>This is potentially life-changing information about serious matters and widespread life-threatening circumstances. Yet among the many reports I have read on the subject of adolescents, contraception and pregnancy, I have never seen a warning in the mainstream media about the dangers of birth control. Thus, it too is accountable for the rising rates of adolescent pregnancy because the only facts reported are those that make contraception appealing.<br /><br />
How many teens are victims of Planned Parenthood’s birth control as the way to hide promiscuity bandwagon? Millions, I am sure, and these young people are the same young people who are getting how-to lessons on television and experiencing plenty of unsupervised time for experimentation. Now, of course, Planned Parenthood and its cronies in the "drive-by" media and elsewhere will say, “Well, they are going to do it anyway,” to which I would respond, </strong></font><font size="3"><strong>"That may or may not be true, but we should not accept that argument. Our responsibility is to combat it by affirming a teen’s self-respect, and teaching each of them the true meaning of love and the lasting rewards of saving sex for marriage.

In the lyrics for the song “</strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3246%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,” we read these words:&#160;</strong></font></p><blockquote><font size="3"><strong>Hoping to find a friend and a lover,<br />
I'll bless the day I discover<br />
another heart, looking for love!</strong></font></blockquote><p><font size="3"><strong>This song misses the very point that must be made, as do the messages far too many of our young people are getting from their parents, the television and so many other sources one can hardly count them.<br /><br />
Love is much more than finding another person to whom you can give your body; it is a gift that must be nurtured, must grow and should be the foundation for a marriage that will last a lifetime, not a brief fling. But if parents do not accept their proper role first, then we'll continue to read headlines on teen behavior such as today's, until the story itself is no longer newsworthy.<br /><br />
Pope John Paul II made the obligation of parents very clear in his May 2004 message "</strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3241%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>The Media and the Family: A Risk and a Richness</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>":&#160;</strong></font></p><blockquote><font size="3"><strong>Parents, as the primary and most important educators of their children, are also the first to teach them about the media. They are called to train their offspring in the “moderate, critical, watchful and prudent use of the media” in the home (Familiaris Consortio, 76). When parents do that consistently and well, family life is greatly enriched. Even very young children can be taught important lessons about the media: that they are produced by people anxious to communicate messages; that these are often messages to do something - to buy a product, to engage in dubious behaviour - that is not in the child’s best interests or in accord with moral truth; that children should not uncritically accept or imitate what they find in the media.<br /><br />
Parents also need to regulate the use of media in the home. This would include planning and scheduling media use, strictly limiting the time children devote to media, making entertainment a family experience, putting some media entirely off limits and periodically excluding all of them for the sake of other family activities. Above all, parents should give good example to children by their own thoughtful and selective use of media. Often they will find it helpful to join with other families to study and discuss the problems and opportunities presented by the use of the media. Families should be outspoken in telling producers, advertisers, and public authorities what they like and dislike.<br /><br /></strong></font></blockquote><p><font size="3"><strong>The parental love described by the Holy Father, which requires self-sacrifice and commitment, achieves much more than merely ensuring that children view only appropriate media.

Our new president has a golden opportunity to set the record straight about his views on a wide variety of things, including abortion, sex education and euthanasia. To my mind, these are fundamental matters that shape how a man is going to examine any challenge that comes his way. <br /><br />

*For a renewal of the virtues of purity and self-control, especially among our youth.<br /><br />
*In reparation for the scourges of abortion, embryonic stem cell research, euthanasia, cloning, artificial contraception and all manifestations of the culture of death, and especially in reparation for the support and/or complacency that we as American Catholics have shown toward these evils.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The thing that makes this novena so profoundly important during this particular time in America's history is that it puts the entire question of what could happen over the coming four years in the proper perspective.<br /><br />
Here are some examples of what I mean.<br /><br />
First and foremost, we pro-life Americans have a golden opportunity right now to work as never before to bring about a true culture of life in the United States. Pope John Paul II made this term immensely popular in his encyclical </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D1434%2526F%253DH"><em><strong><font size="3">The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae)</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3">. He used it carefully to express the distinct differences between those who embrace death and those who embrace life. Among his many statements, this one from section 50 seems to sum up the challenge/opportunity we currently have before us:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">In the early afternoon of Good Friday, "there was darkness over the whole land ... while the sun's light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two" (Lk 23:44, 45). This is the symbol of a great cosmic disturbance and a massive conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil, between life and death. Today we too find ourselves in the midst of a dramatic conflict between the "culture of death ever more radiantly and brightly, and is revealed as the centre, meaning and goal of all history and of every human life." and the "culture of life." But the glory of the Cross is not overcome by this darkness; rather, it shines ever more radiantly and brightly."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Praying that President Obama, as well as all politicians, will be led to encounter Christ and His truth – in every aspect of their personal and public lives – is a glorious intention that should be on each of our hearts, not only as we move from Inauguration Day to the March for Life memorial observance, but every day. Obviously, we cannot sit down with the president as individuals and pray with him, but each of us can and should pray for him, asking God to reveal the truth of what abortion really is and is not. <br />
In that regard, I was inspired to read these words from </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3346%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">Bishop Robert Vasa</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, written just this week:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Regardless of how many years have passed since the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court Decision and regardless of how prevalent and routine abortion has become in this country, the simple truth remains, it is an act of extreme violence to the pre-born child and to the distressed mother. Thus, if anyone says, "I love God" and still favors abortion, he is, to quote St. John, a liar. May we all live out faithfully what it means to love God.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Yes, we must each pray very specifically for our fellow Americans, including our new president, but it is also incumbent upon us to do more than that. We must act on our faith in a way that resonates with those who have grown accustomed to abortion, are comfortable with relegating it to the category of politics or have never really thought about it at all! After 36 years of decriminalized murder, which is what abortion truly and clearly is, far too many in our midst are in denial. The stream of consciousness that relegates abortion to being merely an "issue," starts with our new president, who said during the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3340%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">presidential debates</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">This is an issue that – look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to – to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, "We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby." Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obama's personal view exposes the problem with America's perspective in a way that makes the novena’s third petition even more urgent. Each of us is tempted to say, "There is nothing I can do to change the way other people think about abortion." However, that is wrong.<br /><br />
Read Obama's words carefully. In an effort to deny the fact that abortion ends the life of an innocent human being, he seeks, in his own words "common ground." He wants the culture of life to sit down with the culture of death and find a space somewhere between them where agreement can be reached. He wants good and evil, Christ and Satan, to be buddies. <br /><br />
You think I am oversimplifying? Well, I am not. In Obama's words is the kernel of what it is that has caused such confusion in the body politic. The idea that abortion is an “issue” obfuscates what it does, who dies, and why it is always and in every case wrong. <br /><br />
Obama said, "Nobody is pro-abortion." If nobody is actually pro-abortion, then why did the man promise Planned Parenthood he would sign the Freedom of Choice Act into law? Why does he constantly advocate for "choice"? The truth is, Obama's rhetoric reflects the state of our thinking in America, and pro-lifers have to change that – one person at a time, one heart at a time, one mind at a time. And with the Lord's help, we can do that.<br /><br />
We can do that for our young people, our elected officials, our fallen-away Catholic brethren and for each other. And while we are praying, we are also obliged to reach out to them with the truth of God's mercy, His love and His fatherly concern.<br /><br />
The novena’s final intention addresses the biggest challenge we each have to face, every day of our lives. Making reparation for the sins that have desecrated God's gift of life, destroyed hope for so many and devastated their inherent ability to change and grow in Christ can be humbling concept. As we pray, asking God to forgive this nation and each of us, individually, for the tragedies that have befallen our children, we are spiritually making reparation for those who have yet to discern that they are debilitated by their personal choices.<br /><br />
The next four years are going to give us remarkable opportunities for growing this pro-life movement, strengthening it from within and expanding our efforts to convert the “mushy middle.” I believe we must include the president in that group as well. I do not believe Obama is an evil man; I do believe he is a man capable of change, capable of recognizing real hope in the cross of Christ and capable of acknowledging the fullness of truth.<br /><br />
May our prayers, our efforts and our desire for profound and positive change be that infusion of hope that this nation needs at this hour.</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;<strong><font size="5">American Life League Info.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Volume 6, Number 11&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; March 16, 2009</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">Prayer Requests<br />

"School District #3" continued, An Analysis of Planned Parenthood’s Family Life Education Program <br />
From <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In School District #3, Planned Parenthood had funded the installation of a Family Life Education program.&#160; Amid protests from parents, including objections to the fact that the program would teach the children values contrary to their religious up-bringing, educators pointed to the high – and rising – teen pregnancy rates and stated that the good of the entire community had to come before the beliefs of any particular students.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Several years after the program had begun, a parent with a child in fourth grade became outraged over the program and the messages it was giving to the young people of the community.&#160; The concerned parent decided to get things started in the school district by holding an informational meeting.&#160; As the speakers read from the actual course material, attendees were surprised to find a number of things being taught.&#160; All were clearly opposed to the sex ed program and one school board member stated he was “shocked” by the nature and extent of the program.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The two school board members who attended the meeting were very upset at the Planned Parenthood program.&#160; They asked the Superintendent of Schools to follow-up.&#160; The Superintendent scheduled a meeting to discuss the matter with the concerned parents.&#160; In preparation for the meeting, parents prepared an analysis of the FLE program in the school.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Some of the controversial elements the parents found in the program included:&#160; sessions in “values clarification;” presentations of the acceptability of contraceptive sex; a strict rule that “there are no right or wrong answers;” and some language that was racially disturbing to the black community.&#160; In addition, parents were upset because, although the program was supposed to be voluntary, no alternative classes of instruction were provided for students whose parents opted to keep them out of the class.&#160; In addition, it was felt that the “negative permission form,” where parents who did not object to the class were assumed to have given permission, was an incorrect measure and that specific approval should be obtained.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">At the time of this analysis the program had been taught each of the past seven years.&#160; The older students who entered the program during the first year had now grown to age 21.&#160; Thus, when figures were published on the teenage pregnancy rates in the area, the teenagers involved had been through the FLE program.&#160; If the promises of the program were correct, the parents should have seen a significant reduction in teenage pregnancy over those years.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">What actually happened?&#160; The statistics published by the state health department revealed that pregnancy rates among teenagers had INCREASED during the time the program had been in place!&#160; In fact, the pregnancy rate among 15- to 19-year-olds had increased over seven percent and the pregnancy rate among 10- to 14-year-olds had increased over five percent.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Despite the promises, despite the putting aside of traditional community values in favor of the “common good” and despite the fact that parents’ objections were labeled as trivial, the FLE program was a FAILURE!!&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Is this surprising?&#160; No!&#160; In fact, these types of programs have failed throughout the United States.&#160; Wherever they have been tried, the results are always the same.&#160; They do nothing to reduce teenage pregnancy and, in most cases, teenage pregnancy increases.&#160; There are many reasons for this failure, but, basically, the programs are flawed in their conception.&#160; Family Life programs, particularly their persistence in promoting the idea that nothing is “right or wrong” only contribute to the problem of teenage pregnancy.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">At the meeting with the Superintendent in September, the parents handed out the prepared statement citing the fact the FLE programs in general are ineffective and that there were no studies to prove that they worked to reduce teen pregnancy.&#160; The FLE Director objected to this and cited a study which showed that FLE programs result in a decreased fertility rate amongst teens.&#160; The parents explained to the FLE Director that she was correct, but that “fertility rate” means birth rate, not pregnancy rate and, in fact, the study she quoted showed that there were more teen pregnancies but less teen births because the program was apparently also good in convincing the children to have abortions!&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The parents then turned their attention to the specific program in the school district and told the superintendent that one of the objections to the program was that it encouraged teens to use contraceptives.&#160; The FLE Director responded quite vocally to this claim as well.&#160; The parents handed the course curriculum guide, published by the school, to the superintendent and asked him to read it for himself.&#160; When the superintendent realized that the parents were actually reading from the school’s own documents and that the FLE Director was giving him wrong information, the tone of the meeting changed.&#160; (NOTE:&#160; The lying of those people involved with FLE programs is not uncommon.)</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">A junior from the high school who was also present at the meeting told the superintendent that he had taken the courses in question and that the general attitude he received from the course is that it is perfectly OK to have pre-marital sex, just don’t get pregnant!&#160; He stated that most of the kids he knew got the same message from the course.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The meeting ran for almost two hours before the superintendent had to leave.&#160; He did, however, arrange for a follow-up meeting and did commit to the parents that changes would be made in the program including the removal of contraceptive-pushing class sessions.&#160; He stated that the program would be reoriented to put much more emphasis on chastity and “saying no.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial;

Such is the case with the growing popularity of personhood not only within the pro-life movement but within the political structure of various state legislatures as well.<br /><br />
The most recent addition to the mounting list of personhood victories is the State Senate in Montana, where just yesterday they passed a proposal authored by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=180&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">State Senator Dan McGee</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">.&#160;He has distinguished himself in many ways over his political career, but most recently his call for personhood has made him a favorite among pro-life leaders who realize that without personhood the civil rights of preborn children will always be in jeopardy.<br /><br />
The bill that narrowly passed in the state senate, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=157&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">26-24</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">,&#160; makes the following statement, "...</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=169&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">person </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">means a human being at all stages of human development of life, including the state of fertilization or conception, regardless of age, health, level of functioning, or condition of dependency."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In other words, should the bill pass the Montana state house as well, and go to the voters as a ballot measure in 2010, it would provide the people of the state with a great deal to think about when it comes to addressing exactly who is that human being who dies every time an abortion is committed. It would further challenge that status quo in a way that has never been done in the past.<br /><br />
In this struggle to defend the rights of the most vulnerable Americans in our midst, Montana becomes the second state this year to actually say, in one of the two legislative houses, that people of all ages deserve equal protection under the law. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=179&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">North Dakota</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> became the first state just a week ago.

Such progress is a huge hurdle for the evermore-frustrated proponents of the abortion establishment’s status quo. This is one of the reasons why I believe strongly that commentator </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=168&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">William Saletan </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">has extended a tired, but oh so tempting hand by telling his readers that the challenge that faces both pro-lifers and pro-abortionists is, simply as follows:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">…to put these two issues together. For liberals, that means taking abortion seriously as an argument for contraception. We should make the abortion rate an index of national health, like poverty or infant mortality. The president should report progress, or lack thereof, in the State of the Union. <br /><br />
Reproductive-health counselors must speak bluntly to women who are having unprotected sex. And as Mr. Obama observed last year, men must learn that “responsibility does not end at conception.”<br /><br />
Conservatives, in turn, need to face the corollary truth: A culture of life requires an ethic of contraception. Birth control isn’t a sin or an offense against life, as so many girls and Catholic couples have been taught. It’s a loving, conscientious way to prevent the conception of a child you can’t bear to raise and don’t want to abort. It’s an act of responsibility and respect for life.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">See what I mean by the “peculiar penchant”?&#160; The man who can write with a straight face that abortion is killing wishes to placate the mushy, amoral middle, by calling on what he sees as “liberal” versus “conservative” factions to get it together and find that age-old common ground called contraception.<br /><br />
Dear Mr. Saletan, when will you learn that those of us who work so hard to defend the rights of our brothers and sisters who await birth already know that contraception is the root cause of abortion?&#160; <br />
Sociologist </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=174&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Lionel Tiger</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> knows it. “With effective contraception controlled by women, there are still more abortions than ever…Contraception causes abortion.” <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=181&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Christopher Tietze</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, a Planned Parenthood researcher, knew it too and wrote in 1981,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">[A] high correlation between abortion experience and contraceptive experience ... women who have practiced contraception are more likely to have had abortions than those who have not practiced contraception, and women who have had abortions are more likely to have been contraceptors than women without a history of abortion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In addition, it is a fact, a fact that has been recognized by the very people who work so hard to see that abortion is a “right” and a “privilege,” that they themselves were the most influential in convincing the medical community that pregnancy had to be redefined. They did this so that their promotion of contraception would not put them in the embarrassing position of admitting that the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=178&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">pill aborts children</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. As a matter of fact,&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">At the 1964 Population Council symposium, Dr. Samuel Wishik pointed out that acceptance or rejection of birth control would depend on whether it caused an early abortion. Dr. Tietze, of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council suggested, as a public relations ploy, "not to disturb those people for whom this is a question of major importance." Tietze added that theologians and jurists have always taken the prevailing biological and medical consensus of their times as factual, and that "if a medical consensus develops and is maintained that pregnancy, and therefore life, begins at implantation, eventually our brethren from the other faculties will listen."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Therefore it isn’t really that peculiar that a latter day culture war expert like Saletan would make a sincere effort to encourage principled pro-lifers to set aside their alleged religious beliefs and buy into the lie that contraception will curtail the number of abortions. That very argument is a tale as old as the culture of death, and it will persist until personhood is finally the mantra of the America people and the Constitutional fact it should always have been.<br /><br />
The last thing the pro-aborts want to admit is that our quest for personhood and our absolute opposition to contraception has nothing to do with religious beliefs but everything to do with truly caring for the health and welfare of our fellow human beings, born and preborn.<br /><br />
Mark my words, folks. Peculiar penchants are going to increase, and the one that always disturbs me the most is not Saletan’s, but that dehumanizing, but ever popular query, “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=24&amp;L=167&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Should fertilized eggs have rights?</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">” <br /><br />
My response to this one is, simply “Probably not if they are the product of plant or animal reproduction, but when they are of human origin they should have the same rights as you and I.&#160; After all, that “fertilized egg” is actually a human being, an individual, a unique person with his own DNA.”&#160;&#160; <br /><br />

It is written in a very special code on DNA, and the first cell is the first part of the magnetic reading machine, so that it will decipher the code on DNA, and play human life.

Get ready, folks, because the counterfeit words are going to&#160;be slung around like rotten eggs.&#160; Let’s just be prepared to debunk every one of them.&#160; After all, there never was a peculiar penchant that couldn’t be disposed of with simple facts.</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="3">&#160;<strong>P</strong></font><font size="4"><strong>ro-Life Today |&#160;25&#160;February 2009</strong></font></p><p><em><strong><font size="3"><u>Your National Daily News Wrap from American Life League!</u> American Life League is the largest grassroots pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.

As the Associated Press reported&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Report co-author Rachel Benson Gold called the family planning program "smart government at its best," asserting that every dollar spent on it saves taxpayers $4 in costs associated with unintended births to mothers eligible for Medicaid-funded natal careâ€¦.<br /><br />
The Guttmacher report provides ammunition for those who will advocate the funding increase.<br /><br />
Surveying data from the 2006 fiscal year, the report says the national family planning program prevented 1.94 million unintended pregnancies, including almost 400,000 teen pregnancies. Based on statistical analysis and projections, these pregnancies would have resulted in 860,000 unintended births, 810,000 abortions and 270,000 miscarriages, according to the report.<br />
Without publicly funded family planning, it said, the U.S. abortion rate would be nearly two-thirds higher, and nearly twice as high among poor women.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">But in essence, the report does not address the fundamental problem with the ongoing self-serving, subjective Planned Parenthood rhetoric, nor does it tell us how we save four dollars. <br /><br />
The very program that the Alan Guttmacher Institute claims prevents 810,000 abortions functions by providing the chemicals and devices, "family planning measures," that themselves cause </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=18&amp;L=129&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">abortion</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> during the human being's first eight days of life. That is, they abort prior to implantation. That is a fact that has been proven by one of the very organizations one would think would be aligned with Planned Parenthood. That organization is the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ASRM makes it perfectly clear that contraception does abort.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">In a summary of the development of contraception in the United States, the [ASRM] statement called oral contraceptives the "most widely used" reversible method. In the "wide variety" of oral contraceptives that are available, the "mechanisms of action" are the same, said the statement: "inhibition of ovulation, alteration in the cervical mucus, and/or modification of the endometrium, thus preventing implantation."&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Further the term "unintended pregnancy" is a conveniently negative statement designed to alienate the couple who has engaged in sexual relations and did not "intend" to have a baby. The subconscious idea is that a preborn child is a problem that the mother needs to eliminate because she did not "intend" to have him. <br /><br />
Though PP points out that more of these "unintended" children are born than die, the fact is that not one of them should ever have to die based on parental intention. Let's face it, if a couple does not want to have a family, then abstain from the activity that makes having a family possible! That's common sense.<br /><br />
Not only that, but </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=18&amp;L=126&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Stop Planned Parenthood International</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> pointed out in its weekly <em>Wednesday STOPP Report</em> that PP is not effective at reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy anyway! <br /><br />
To prove their point, STOPP cites a </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=18&amp;L=133&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Brookings Institute report</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> which states:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">With premarital sex the rule, rather than the exception, an out-of-wedlock childbirth gradually ceased to be a sign that society's sexual taboos had been violated. The reduction in stigma also helps explain why women who would once have put their baby up for adoption chose to keep it instead.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">It is of interest that as in the case with the ASRM, Brookings is no bastion of pro-life philosophy. In fact, they promote abortion as the proper response to "unintended pregnancy." But my point is quite simple: PP's Alan Guttmacher Institute is standing before Congress with hands extended, asking for more money for programs that frankly have not worked. These "programs" have created a situation in which more young people are damaged for life because of sexually transmitted diseases and have a given those same young people a rather warped perspective on the value of saving sex until marriage.<br /><br />
But what about that four dollar savings?

Every dollar spent to provide services in the nationwide network of publicly funded family planning clinics saves $4.02 in pregnancy-related and newborn care costs to Medicaid.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">This statement speaks volumes about how the culture of death views pregnancy, childbearing and parenthood. What these anti-baby fanatics are really saying is that spending taxpayer dollars on helping the expectant mother through her nine month pregnancy and then helping her with the costs involved in giving birth is simply not worthy of taxpayer support, but recommending contraception and abortion is!

Yes, that's right.

There is no doubt he was referring to every human being, born and preborn. He would therefore, undoubtedly be very proud of the state of North Dakota.<br /><br />
The North Dakota House has already passed a </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=118&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">personhood bill</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> that is undeniably among the most concise statements of fact in the nation. The bill reads as follows:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Section 1. References to individual, person or human being â€“ Legislative Intent. For purposes of interpretation of the constitution and laws of North Dakota, it is the intent of the legislative assembly that an individual, a person, when the context indicates that a reference to an individual is intended, or a human being includes any organism with the genome of homo sapiens.<br /><br />
Section 2. State to Defend Challenge. The legislative assembly, by concurrent resolution, may appoint one or more of its members, as a matter of right and in the legislative member's official capacity, to intervene to defend this Act in any case in which this Act's constitutionality is challenged.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=112&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">State Representative Dan Ruby</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> is the state's leader on this bill and his courageous defense of personhood is inspiring.

Dan Ruby, R-Minot, has been getting attention across the nation.<br /><br />
The bill defines human life as beginning at conception and would allow constitutional rights to extend to every unborn human whether in or out of the womb.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Actually, the language of the bill is much more precise than what the newspaper reported. This is necessary in a piece of legislation as crucial as North Dakota's H.R. 1572 because the word "conception" has been co-opted by the abortion movement. It was once accepted that "conception" meant the moment when a human being begins biologically, at fertilization. However, with the passage of time, the pro-aborts have caused a change and today </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=116&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">conception </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">is defined in many quarters as implantation, thus denying that anyone is conceived before he or she is eight days old and firmly attached to his mother's uterus. <br /><br />
Thus, the language of this bill had to state "a human being includes any organism with the genome of homo sapiens." This linguistic precision acknowledges the existence of any human being from his beginning whether he comes into being asexually or sexually. That may sound like splitting hairs, but clearly, we cannot be too careful. The stakes are too high. <br /><br />
With this tremendous victory in North Dakota, which is far from over since the state senate has yet to vote, we were caught up in a moment of celebration. We nearly forgot about such concerns as Nancy Pelosi's visit with Pope Benedict XVI.&#160; But Joe Murray's article in the </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=117&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Philadelphia Bulletin</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3"> reminded us that not all is rosy in pro-life land these days.<br /><br />
In Murray's article, "Pope, Pelosi and Personhood" he presents the entire perspective, or what I call the good, the bad and the very ugly. Murray makes a point to clarify the questionable position Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi takes when she defines herself as an "ardent" Catholic, but his analysis goes far beyond Pelosi-isms. <br /><br />
He writes</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Aside from North Dakota, Maryland, Montana, South Carolina and Alabama have introduced personhood bills, while efforts are currently underway in Mississippi and Oregon. On the federal level, U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., has introduced the federal personhood measure.<br /><br />
And though Democrats, led largely by Mrs. Pelosi, a pro-abortion Catholic, continue to impede such measures, Pope Benedict XVI recently reminded the lawmaker her faith should come before her ideology in a meeting this week at the Vatican.<br /><br />
"His Holiness took the opportunity to speak of the requirements of the natural moral law and the Church's consistent teaching on the dignity of human life from conception to natural death which enjoins all Catholics, and especially legislators, jurists and those responsible for the common good of society, to work in cooperation with all men and women of good will in creating a just system of laws capable of protecting human life at all stages of its development," the Vatican wrote in a statement released moments prior to the two meeting.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">So, as the pro-life movement stands at the crossroads of finally addressing personhood in more states than ever before in our 36-year history, we have this convergence of events. We continue to witness the intransigence of the pro-abortion Catholic, the moral clarity of Catholic teaching and the bold, new face of the personhood pro-lifer. It is really quite a historic moment for all of us who fight for the human rights of the most defenseless in our midst. <br /><br />
Every pro-lifer understands Pelosi's wrongheadedness, and each is grateful for Pope Benedict XVI's loving correction of the lovely lady at the very moment when personhood is being voted on in North Dakota. We do not think for a moment that these events occurred in the same time frame by accident. <br /><br />
So yesterday, you can imagine my surprise when I read the blathering of Professor Douglas Kmiec, an Obama Catholic, who not only challenges what the Holy Father's statement said in reference to Pelosi, but calls on him to correct himself.<br /><br />
Oh yes! </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=110&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Kmiec </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">writes in <em>Time </em>magazine online,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Might there be a different, less intrusive course for the Church? Yes: clarify the Pelosi statement by continuing to observe the difference between a jurist and a legislator. That may be awkward from the standpoint of the unyielding lines of moral rather than political principle, but it has the merit of following the instruction of St. Thomas Aquinas, who argued that "all should have some part in the government; for in this way peace is preserved among the people, and all are pleased with such a disposition of things and maintain it."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Few are pleased with the abortion jurisprudence as it is. But imposing moral duties on Catholic jurists that are incompatible with their envisioned judicial role in a democracy is hardly likely to make it better.<br /><br />
One can only define what Kmiec is saying here as balderdash, or more to the point, rubbish! For any right-thinking person in public life, Catholic or otherwise, the moral principles of defending the right to life are unchanging, regardless of his role as lawmaker or judge. Perhaps Kmiec should refresh his understanding of what makes democracy work. Perhaps he should pay close attention to what Pope John Paul II wrote in </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=15&amp;L=109&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Splendor of Truth</font></strong></em></a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">The Church's firmness in defending the universal and unchanging moral norms is not demeaning at all. Its only purpose is to serve man's true freedom. Because there can be no freedom apart from or in opposition to the truth, the categorical â€” unyielding and uncompromising â€” defence of the absolutely essential demands of man's personal dignity must be considered the way and the condition for the very existence of freedom. <br /><br />
This service is directed to <em>every man</em>, considered in the uniqueness and singularity of his being and existence: only by obedience to universal moral norms does man find full confirmation of his personal uniqueness and the possibility of authentic moral growth. For this very reason, this service is also directed to <em>all mankind</em>: it is not only for individuals but also for the community, for society as such. These norms in fact represent the unshakable foundation and solid guarantee of a just and peaceful human coexistence, and hence of genuine democracy, which can come into being and develop only on the basis of the equality of all its members, who possess common rights and duties. <em>When it is a matter of the moral norms prohibiting intrinsic evil, there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone</em>. It makes no difference whether one is the master of the world or the "poorest of the poor" on the face of the earth. Before the demands of morality we are all absolutely equal.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Note his words: "there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone." Whether the lawmaker or would-be judge is supportive of Dan Ruby's proposal in North Dakota or the myriad other legislative proposals that address the wrong of abortion, the obvious fact is the same: Abortion is an intrinsic evil and it must be eradicated from the law. Nothing that results in such a heinous outcome can ever be, in a just society, legal.<br /><br />
We extend our gratitude to Dan Ruby and Pope Benedict XVI; we praise God for the wisdom of Pope John Paul II that lives on through his writings, and we pray for the conversion of heart of folks like Nancy Pelosi and Douglas Kmiec who have somehow lost the ability to see truth with clarity and complete understanding.</font></strong></p><p><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><hr /><p><strong>&#160;<font size="3">Volume 6, Number 8</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;Monday, February 23, 2009</font></strong></p><p><br /><strong><font size="3">Prayer Requests<br />

By ALL Staff</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A stem cell is a type of cell found in all human beings.&#160; They’re found in animals as well. Stem cells have a couple of important characteristics: they can reproduce themselves over a long period of time without changing, and they have the capability to produce other types of specialized cells, such as brain cells, muscle cells and lung cells, to name but a few.&#160; There are a number of different places from which stem cells can be obtained: bone marrow, fat cells, umbilical cord blood, adult blood, skin cells, olfactory nerve endings and embryos.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obtaining stem cells from fatty tissue, bone marrow or the umbilical cord after the birth of a baby may be done ethically. No harm comes to the person whose stem cells are obtained for research in such fashion.&#160; Obtaining stem cells from a human embryo, however, is highly unethical. A human embryo is an innocent human being in his first stage of life. There is only one way to obtain stem cells from a developing human embryo, and it involves killing the embryo. In every case, it is always morally wrong to intentionally kill an innocent human being at any point in life, including the embryonic stage of development. Sacrificing a child in the name of science is still child sacrifice.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">There are those in the government and scientific community who say more money must be spent on human embryonic stem cell research because it holds the most promise for helping people with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.&#160; However, adult stem cells have been used successfully for decades. Bone marrow transplants, for instance, help people every day. There are more than 100 conditions including leukemia, immune system and other blood disorders, cancers and autoimmune diseases that respond well when adult stem cell therapy is used.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Research involving human embryonic stem cells has thus far been unsuccessful in the quest to develop therapeutic treatments. It is speculated that those who support human embryonic stem cell research are clamoring loudly for taxpayer dollars because private companies know human embryonic stem cell research is neither worth their time nor their money.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The popular plea is that human embryonic stem cell research will cure Alzheimer’s disease. However, Alzheimer’s researcher Ned Potter said this research would not help the Alzheimer’s patient at all. It is nerve cells that cause the problem because they lose their ability to connect with each other. Therefore, these embryonic stem cells are not the ones needed. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Far too many reports of possible treatment for diseases are false. Media accounts simply parrot fake science. This is misleading and could lead to the deaths of millions of innocent human beings if this type of research is allowed to move forward.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">According to a recent RAND Corporation survey of in vitro fertilization clinics in the United States, the vast majority of the 400,000 human embryos currently being stored—88.2% of them—are wanted by their parents so that larger families can be part of their future.&#160; But even if this were not the case, there is no justification for killing one innocent human being, regardless of where he lives—including a freezer in a clinic. Killing is still killing. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">A human being begins at the first moment of his or her biological development.&#160; There is no greater pivotal moment in an individual’s growth and development than when chromosomes from the father join with chromosomes from the mother to form a unique, new biologic entity—a human being who never existed prior to that moment.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Those who attempt to deceive the public by using words like clump of cells, blob of tissue, pre-embryo and so forth are either ignorant of the basic scientific facts or think that people like us are gullible enough to believe almost anything.&#160; Arm yourself with the truth to defend millions of tiny embryonic human beings who cannot speak for themselves.

Following Meeting with Pope, News of Secret Meeting between Pelosi and her Bishop on Abortion&#160;<br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=3&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/feb/09021809.html</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> <br /></font></strong><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">Life Site News<br /></font></span>In the wake of House Speaker Pelosi's closed-door meeting with Pope Benedict XVI last weekend, news has erupted that earlier this month Pelosi secretly met with her own bishop, Archbishop George Niederauer of San Francisco, to discuss her stance on abortion.&#160; Pelosi had publicly accepted an invitation to meet with Niederauer after the Speaker attempted to justify abortion in light of Catholic teaching last year during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press. Michael Voris of Real Catholic TV broke the news today that the promised meeting took place Sunday, February 8 in a third-party home in San Francisco.&#160; Voris reports that Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said that the Speaker described the meeting as "cordial and pleasant ... a fair exchange and good."&#160; When asked whether Pelosi had changed her position on abortion to agree with Catholic teaching, Daly stated, "You won't see that happening.&#160; She is not changing her position on abortion." <br /><br />

"Every day Mr. President, people with your ethnic background die in astounding numbers," said Mr. Hughes.&#160; "Abortion is the number one killer of African Americans in the U.S." Citing abortion statistics, Hughes said: "African Americans make up about 13% of the U.S. population but about 37% of all babies killed by abortion are black.

ACROBATS â€“ CATHOLIC-STYLE</span><br /><em>By Judie Brown</em></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">When your head is swimming from all the commentary ebbing and flowing from yesterday's Pelosi encounter with the Holy Father, the essence of what actually occurred is lost. The fundamental question of our day, what is truth, evaporates in headlines and public pronouncements. One is left asking, is that all there is?<br /><br />
Was this just another media circus? Are the acrobats still swinging? <br /><br />
Why didn't the pope just excommunicate Pelosi, one person asked me! Well, maybe he did, though she clearly has done a pretty good job of excommunicating herself. At least that is my opinion. The fact is nobody knows precisely what was said in that private meeting and the only person who will not "spin" to his advantage is the person who doesn't need to â€¦ Pope Benedict XVI.<br /><br />
I only wish Pelosi was an isolated example of Catholic thinking gone awry, but she is not. <br />
In the halls and classrooms of Boston College, a Catholic university, something new has been added, and as </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=7&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Boston Globe</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3"> reporter Michael Paulsen writes, the reaction is mixed. Said one professor:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">"I believe that the display of religious signs and symbols, such as the crucifix, in the classroom is contrary to the letter and spirit of open intellectual discourse that makes education worthwhile and distinguishes first-rate universities from mediocre and provincial ones," Maxim D. Shrayer, chairman of the department of Slavic and Eastern languages and literatures, said in an interview.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Shrayer is referring to a crucifix, the traditional Catholic icon reminding Catholics of the essence of Catholic identity. Does he know he is actually being paid by a Catholic institution that is striving these days to be proud of its identity? <br /><br />
Perhaps Shrayer would be happier at the Catholic Assumption University in Windsor, Canada, where </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=8&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Father Paul Rennick</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> recently made the following statement to a member of the media, "Abortion is not an infallible teaching. It never has been proclaimed infallibly," he said. <br /><br />
Of interest is that what happened when the reporter from the ardently pro-Catholic, pro-life </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=9&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">LifeSiteNews</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> attempted to contact Bishop Ronald Fabbro, who is the university's chancellor, for a reaction to Father Rennick's statement. Mark Adkinson, Director of Communications for the diocese told the reporter that the bishop was not available for comment, and said, "â€¦I don't view LifeSiteNews as a legitimate news source."<br /><br />
So on the one hand, we have a Catholic university striving to assert its identity even as members of its faculty are decrying that fact. While on the other hand we have a Catholic bishop in Canada who will not address the scandalous comments of a Catholic university president because he denies the integrity of one of the finest news reporting organizations in the entire pro-life, Catholic community.<br /><br />
The acrobats are definitely flying, or are those actually dingbats?<br /><br />
Let's move on to an allegedly Catholic organization's claims that increased spending on welfare programs will result in substantial reductions in state abortion rates while many pro-life laws have the opposite effect. The organization in question, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=10&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, made the claim after they released a study in August of last year. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=11&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Professor Michael New</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> of the University of Alabama kept an eye on this, and just this past week he wrote </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Not surprisingly, this study had a substantial impact on the debate over sanctity of life issues during the 2008 Presidential election. Self proclaimed pro-lifers who support Democratic Presidential nominees can be found in every election cycle. However, this study gave Doug Kmiec, Nicholas Cafardi, and others intellectual legitimacy in arguing that pro-life voters should vote for liberals, even if they favor abortion-on-demand and its public funding, in order to advance the pro-life cause. â€¦ It seemed too good to be true.<br /><br />
It was. In November, with no public announcement, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good removed this study from their website. A replacement version was uploaded shortly thereafter. The replacement version differs from its predecessor in a number of interesting ways. â€¦<br /><br />
It is unfortunate that the faulty research of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good was used as political cover to help make such a thing [the election of Obama] possible. As the Obama administration continues its assault on laws and policies upholding the sanctity of human life, pro-lifers need to hold this organization morally accountable.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">This is but another case of the abuses perpetrated on the American people in the name of a type of fraudulent Catholicism that is neither genuinely Catholic nor ethically sound. <br /><br />
These few examples should provoke us to question and to challenge the legitimacy of those alleged Catholics like Pelosi who parade their identity for the express purpose of creating subversion within the Church where all that is good is denied, while all that is evil is praised.<br /><br />
Such swinging in the wind should also help us express appreciation for those prelates who are dedicated to advancing the truth without regard to media bias, character assassination or attempted humiliation by those who believe their earthly power should make Catholic bishops and priests cower.<br /><br />
When </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dioceseofscranton.org/News/Bishop'sResponseToMisericordiaFebruary16,2009.asp"><strong><font size="3">Scranton Bishop Joseph Martino</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> publicly criticized Misericordia University recently for a scheduled lecture on gay rights by Keith Boykin â€“ a gay rights advocate, the diocese issued a statement in which it said </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Bishop Martino wants Catholics of the Diocese of Scranton to know of his absolute disapproval of Misericordia University's hosting Mr. Boykin. By honoring this speaker through allowing his positions, so antithetical to Catholic Church teaching, to be broadcast on its campus, the University has rejected all four essential characteristics of a Catholic institution of higher learning. These are: its Christian inspiration, its obligation to reflect on knowledge in light of the Catholic faith, its fidelity to Catholic Church teaching and its commitment to serve the people of God.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">But the mainstream media, not at all interested in the ideals that should be upheld by a Catholic university, reported the incident this way:&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">In a prepared statement, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=13&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Misericordia University</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> addressed the controversy surrounding Bishop Martino's criticism. According to the statement, the university understands the bishop's views, but Mr. Boykin's visit to the campus was not meant to advocate for a single issue.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In other words, academic freedom excuses Catholic universities from providing a sound Catholic education to the students. One has to wonder how it is that a Catholic university can defy the bishop while pandering to the politics of abortion, contraception and homosexuality. It must be the thin air up there on the trapeze.<br /><br />
My second example of heroic bishops is Bishop Thomas J. Tobin who recently wrote "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=9&amp;L=20&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">My Interview with President Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">." <br /><br />
Obviously, Bishop Tobin did not have this interview, but he told his readers he certainly could imagine having it, and here is an excerpt from one of the most brilliant tongue in cheek perspectives I have ever seen:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">TOBIN: Is it safe to assume that you consider the use of tax dollars to pay for abortions overseas to be good foreign policy? <br /><br />
OBAMA: I believe that people overseas should have the same rights we Americans have â€“ the right to kill their children and use abortion as a form of birth control. <br /><br />
TOBIN: But shouldn't we be using foreign aid for more positive reasons â€“ for example, to provide food, clothing, shelter and medicine to impoverished children? <br /><br />
OBAMA: Bishop, obviously you're missing the point. If you control the population and eliminate the children, you don't have to worry about giving them food, clothing, shelter and medicine now do you?&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In the writings and actions of bishops like Martino and Tobin, we find the fearless response needed to counter the emotional, mental and political acrobatics of those who, like Pelosi, will use any excuse on God's green earth to further insult Christ and His Church.<br /><br />
Like the trapeze artist who flies through the air with the greatest of ease, so-called Catholics like Pelosi, Father Rennick and the leadership of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good will defy gravity, or in this case, truth, for the express purpose of advancing an evil agenda, the centerpiece of which is preborn child killing.<br /><br />
But as we all know, truth prevails where fervent faith is alive. As Christ instructs us, "If your faith were the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it would move; nothing would be impossible for you."

There could be a surprise in store, although as political strategist and writer of “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3602&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Inside Catholic</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">” commentary Deal Hudson points out, "The Holy Father is a head of state and regularly meets with political leaders from every nation, regardless of their positions on issues important to the Church.”&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Hudson comments,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">It's a good idea for Benedict to meet with Pelosi, because one can never underestimate the impact of being in his presence. It's also worth remembering that, if the protocol of past meetings remains the same, the Holy Father will make formal remarks in front of the media before any private meeting. Benedict will very likely make comments criticizing the Obama administration for ending the Mexico City Policy and warning the new Congress against passing the Freedom of Choice Act.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Again, nobody knows how this event will unfold, but we can hope that a miracle occurs.&#160; <br /><br />
On the practical level, the fact is that under the Catholic definition of "heretic," Nancy Pelosi long ago distanced herself from truth, and she is playing a dangerous game.&#160;<br /><br />
The <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> tells us that “<em><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=1212&amp;F=H">Heresy </a></em>is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith.” One of those truths, written in the Ten Commandments, is that&#160;God said, “Thou shalt not kill.”&#160;In discussing this commandment, the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3593&amp;F=H">Catechism </a></em>states,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">2261 Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth commandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous." The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of the Creator. The law forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each and everyone, always and everywhere.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Therefore, if one acknowledges the fact that the act of abortion is an act of murder that takes the life of an innocent human being, one can objectively know that Pelosi, whom I presume was baptized into the Catholic Church, is in denial about a truth that must be believed with divine and Catholic faith.&#160; She is “ardent,” if not downright intransigent, in her views regarding abortion and, as we learned most recently, birth control as well. She offered “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3359&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">no apologies</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">.”</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Therefore, regardless of the smiles, the warm handshakes or whatever else might occur tomorrow, the fact is that Pelosi’s soul is in jeopardy.&#160;This should be of immense concern to all of us and&#160;a reason to pray that perhaps, when Pelosi is in the pope’s presence this time, she will somehow be touched by a spirit of humility that&#160;forces her to confront her demons and deal with truth, instead of&#160;her personal version of what it means to be Catholic.<br /><br />
Pope Benedict has taught us much about the proper formation of conscience, and in one of his most memorable statements, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3599&amp;F=H">Conscience and Truth</a></em>,&#160;he said, "A man of conscience is one who never acquires tolerance, well-being, success, public standing, and approval on the part of prevailing opinion, at the expense of truth." <br /><br />
In this commentary, the Holy Father said there were two standards that define a real voice, a real conscience. “First, conscience is not identical to personal wishes and taste. Secondly, conscience cannot be reduced to social advantage, to group consensus or to the demands of political and social power.”<br /><br />
Dear Nancy, are you listening?<br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3598&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Pope John Paul II</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, with whom then-Cardinal Ratzinger was remarkably close, taught,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3"><em>To be a person of conscience</em> means working to build up the kingdom of God—the kingdom of truth and life, of justice, love and peace—in our families, in the communities in which we live and throughout our homeland. It also means courageously assuming responsibility for public affairs; it means being concerned for the common good and not closing our eyes to the misery and needs of our neighbor, in a spirit of Gospel solidarity: "Bear one another's burdens" (Gal 6:2).</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Madam Speaker, did you hear this?<br /><br />
It is here, at this crossroads between the upright conscience and the dead conscience, that Nancy Pelosi will meet her nemesis, the bane of her existence:&#160;the Vicar of Christ on Earth.&#160;It may well be that she will depart from her meeting with the Holy Father as committed to denying the right to life of innocent preborn babies as she was when she arrived.&#160;It could be that she will never examine her views in the light of the “ardent” faith she claims as her own.&#160;Only God knows what the result will be.&#160;<br /><br />
Regardless, it is clear that her arrogance in even requesting such a meeting is but another sign of the abyss that exists between the truth of God’s Word and Pelosi’s view of what it means to be a believer.&#160;This is why she needs our prayers; this is why her view will not prevail.&#160;Pelosi’s public embrace of the evil of abortion will not go unnoticed by the Holy Father, but I am certain that he will in this encounter be as gentle as Christ and&#160;equally as firm.&#160;We must not forget what he said in his homily on the day of&#160;the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=719&amp;L=3591&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">inauguration&#160;of his pontificate</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;four years ago:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">The human race – every one of us – is the sheep lost in the desert which no longer knows the way.

Two of the group’s members held large signs and conversed with students on the public sidewalk. According to the group, a campus officer called the police department when they refused to leave the area. Over a dozen squad cars reportedly arrived at the school and the police officers began arresting members of the group.&#160;&#160; Lahoci Franco, 24, one of the sign holders, was the first arrested. According to the group’s press release, protestor Rev. Henry “Bud” Shaver, 30, was told that the sidewalk was not public property for “non-citizens of Birmingham.”<br /><br />

So when I got the following message, my heart went right into my throat (figuratively speaking) and I decided at once that the story was a hoax.<br /><br />
But now I am convinced it is true. The story goes like this. In November of 2008, I received the following e-mail from a fellow pro-lifer in Michigan:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Just after election night when Michigan adopted </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3585&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Proposal 2</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> (which made embryonic stem cell [research] easier to do in Michigan!), a local news station ran a story about a couple who had tried everything to help their toddler who had severe brain trauma. The story claimed that the "victory for stem cell research in MI" would help children and families with similar plights...However, the news reporter refused to mention the exact type of treatment being given to the child. So, I called... <br /><br />
The news station said that the family did not want to divulge any info about the specifics. They just wanted donations. So I went to the family's donation web site and inquired there... <br /><br />
To make a long story short, I assumed that the whole thing was a sham; that the child was most likely receiving adult stem cell therapy, not embryonic. To my knowledge, to date there is NO embryonic research that has had any positive outcomes. I have taught this to adults and youth in my church and school. My facts are based on what I read in ALL, HLI, and similar publications.<br /><br />
Here is where the plot thickens... <br /><br />
The father of the child called me back! He made me insist that I was not a reporter. He went on to tell me that they are paying for treatment from a European doctor … It is alleged that in Europe, women electing abortion are given a chance to "donate their aborted fetus to science." I guess this offers some altruistic sense of generosity toward the public good to women who choose to kill their young. <br /><br />
The father and I talked at length. I told him that I had hoped he would say it was adult stem research b/c I have a family member with a similar condition, but we are devout Catholics and could never use embryos for any treatment for our child. He justified himself, saying he thought and prayed for some time...the fetuses were already dead, and nothing could be done about that...and everyone has to make the choice for themselves...He also asked me to keep the doctor's web site on the QT because he did not want any bad press..</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obviously the parents of this little boy were desperate for help for their child, and the "European doctor" they chose does indeed exist, does have a web site, is actually an American, and has a sordid history.

Rader, a Malibu psychiatrist who ran a chain of eating disorder clinics in Los Angeles, has cooperated with Yuliy Baltaytis in the past. Rader was kicked out of the Bahamas, but not before he had made more than $33 million treating a thousand patients with fetal stem cell injections. Rader says that he has not published anything in the medical literature because it would leave him vulnerable to attacks from a "conspiracy" of scientists, government authorities, and pro-lifers (where have we heard that line before?) The business, which he co-founded with Baltaytis, has run through a succession of names, including Mediquest Ltd., Czech Foundation and Dulcinea. It is now called "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3578&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Medra</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">," and its web site&#160; boasts that it can use fetal stem cells to cause "remarkable physical and psychological improvements" regarding virtually every known ailment, including Alzheimer's, autism, brain damage, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, impotence, leukemia, MS, Parkinson's, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle-cell anemia, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and even the effects of aging. All patients have to do is get to the Dominican Republic, "a one-hour-and-forty-five-minute flight from Miami." Oh, and bring plenty of cash.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The Human Life International report also states, the fetal stem cell injection industry is rife with fraud. This is natural whenever massive amounts of money can be made in a very short period of time with all the risk being borne by gullible patients.<br /><br />
It's important to note that in this age of Internet communication, reports and stories can get out there, which can either be totally fabricated, or as real as the nose on your face. And in Rader's case, his reviewers and those who know of his work are anything but a cheering fan club. For example, "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3575&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Cure A.L.S Ride for Life Online</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">" tells the 2005 story of Anne Dumphy who was dying of ALS and thought that Dr. Rader held positive hope for her. As it turned out, she spent $30,000 on Rader's stem cell therapy, got a stronger immune system and died of ALS anyway. As the report makes clear Rader is playing on emotions and making promise that he does not seem to deliver.<br /><br />
In a similar commentary on the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3581&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">ALS Therapy Development Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> web site, one person posted in 2004, "My Aunt had the procedure by Dr. Rader in the Dominican Republic two years ago. The procedure did help her immune system but did not stop the progression of her ALS. We feel the $ given to Dr. Rader could have been better spent."<br /><br />
And in 2005, The </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=715&amp;L=3579&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Los Angeles Times</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3"> ran a story on what they termed "unproven stem cell therapies" being marketed from clinics outside the United States. Rader was one of those who were featured in the report. He claimed to have cured early Alzheimer's, said he charges $25,000 for the first injection and $8,500 for each follow up injection and told the reporter, "I think there is a higher power. I feel that I am just simply a conduit." The <em>L.A. Times</em> also reports, "Rader, 66, said he has not published anything about his therapy because that would open him to attack from a 'conspiracy' of scientists, government authorities, pharmaceutical companies and abortion opponents."<br /><br />
Today, when you visit the Medra web site, you will find that the fetal stem cells he uses come from Eastern Europe, or at least that is his claim. You will also find nothing in the way of a scientific study or a confirmation of the validity of his work, and no endorsements from prestigious institutions or any kind. <br /><br />
So I ask myself if perhaps the entire in vitro fertilization industry has produced yet another thriving business that would never have come about had scientists never decided that they could "create" babies better than the proven method designed by God. And after three months of wondering, whatever happened to that anonymous little boy in Michigan who started me thinking about all this?<br /><br />

"School District #3" – from <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As you may recall, we have begun relating real-life stories about various school districts and their encounters with Planned Parenthood.&#160; In School District #1, the fight involved removing a Planned Parenthood “educator” from the school system and was successful over a relatively short period of time.&#160; This case highlighted some important tips on approaching a school board with one’s concerns.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">In School District #2, the fight involved the removal of a child abuse counseling program developed and implemented by Planned Parenthood.&#160; This case involved an entrenched school board and local media heavily biased toward Planned Parenthood.&#160; At one point, it seemed as though the parents had actually lost since the board eventually voted to adopt the program.&#160; However, the large public outcry forced the board to develop a school access policy which, in turn, was later used to keep pro-abortion groups out of the schools and away from the children. It also led to a greater recognition on the part of the school board of the proper role of parents in the decision process of the school. In the end, the original counseling program was eventually abandoned as well!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The next school district we will review posed a much different set of challenges to parents.&#160; In School District #3, Planned Parenthood had funded the installation of a Family Life Education program.&#160; Planned Parenthood considered this its “model” program as evidenced by it being referred to in a number of state level documents.&#160; Funding directly from the state allowed not only the installation of the program, but for a full time Family Life Education director in the school district to oversee it.&#160; In this case, obviously, there was an also an entrenched bureaucracy which the parents would have to overcome.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Several years after the program had begun, a parent with a child in fourth grade became outraged over the program and the messages it was giving to the young people of the community.&#160; She realized her child would be attending this course starting the following year and felt she had to do everything possible to protect her child and the other children in the community.&#160; This parent obtained copies of the curriculum and contacted various pro-life groups in the area for assistance.&#160; The struggle that ensued was a cooperative effort of both many individuals and several groups.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The concerned parent decided to get things started in the school district by holding an informational meeting.&#160; She set up the meeting in a local church hall and invited many other parents and every member of the school board (two of whom actually attended).&#160; The meeting opened with prayer and some singing of religious songs, and then “A Critical Look at Planned Parenthood” was shown.&#160; Finally, the discussion was turned to the specific program in the school district.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As the speakers read from the actual course material, attendees were surprised to find a number of things being taught.&#160; All were clearly opposed to the sex ed program and one school board member stated he was “shocked” by the nature and extent of the program.&#160; Attendees were eager to begin the fight to get it taken out of the school.&#160;</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The two school board members who attended the meeting were very upset at the Planned Parenthood program.&#160; They asked the Superintendent of Schools to follow-up.&#160; The Superintendent scheduled a meeting to discuss the matter with the concerned parents.&#160; In preparation for the meeting, parents prepared an analysis of the FLE program in the school.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Next month:&#160; The analysis of Planned Parenthood’s Family Life Education Program</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><strong>News</strong></font></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3"><em>Vatican official: Bishops have no choice but to refuse communion to pro-abort politicians</em><br />

Lawmakers Pursue Limited Action on Abortion, Family Planning<br /></font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3494&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/News2?abbr=daily2_&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=15376&amp;security=1201&amp;news_iv_ctrl=-1</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">National Partnership for Women and Families<br /></font></span>Antiabortion-rights groups are escalating efforts against the Freedom of Choice Act and other policies to protect abortion rights that President Obama has said he would support, the Baltimore Sun reports. "Antennas are way up in the pro-life community," according to Catholic League President Bill Donahue. As evidence, the Sun cites the massive postcard campaign against the Freedom of Choice Act -- which, if approved by Congress and signed into law, would codify Roe v. Wade and prevent states from infringing on abortion rights. The groups are organizing against FOCA, which Obama had said he would sign, despite the fact that Democrats seem inclined to hold off on pursuing the broad reproductive rights agenda feared by social conservatives. Although more abortion-rights supporters gained House and Senate positions in the 2008 elections, a large number of moderate Democrats who oppose abortion or support only incremental policy changes remain in Congress, the Sun reports. In addition, any large-scale effort to overhaul abortion policies would require expending political capital, which Obama might rather use toward promoting his economic agenda. Democratic lawmakers say that although they remain committed to overturning former President George W. Bush's policies related to abortion rights and family planning, they might postpone pursuing an expansive agenda for the time being. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a past sponsor of FOCA, said she has no plans to reintroduce the bill in the immediate future. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, added that FOCA "is not our top priority right now." Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said, "We deal in reality. You have to be pragmatic, realistic and, in the end, strategic." Keenan added that the "votes just aren't there" to enact significant changes to abortion-related policies. Instead of promoting sweeping changes to abortion and family planning policies, advocates instead are focusing on reversing Bush administration initiatives. Obama already has repealed the "Mexico City" policy, also known as the "global gag rule," which prohibited international organizations that received U.S. aid from promoting or providing abortion-related information and services. In addition, the administration is expected to rescind the HHS "conscience" rule that Bush enacted before leaving office, which allows health care workers to refuse to perform any services that violates their "religious beliefs or moral convictions," the Sun reports.<br /><br />
"Abortion Reduction Strategies" Ignore Half the Problem, Archbishop Warns<br /></font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3495&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=93585</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">EWTN<br /></font></span>During a trip to Ireland this past weekend, Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver delivered a talk to the Irish chapter of Human Life International that outlined the “dos and don’ts” for the pro-life movement. Those who claim pro-lifers should avoid the “divisive” issue of ending legalized abortion and focus on providing better support for pregnant mothers are creating a false division, the archbishop insisted. Following the theme “An American view on how to build a culture of life,” Archbishop Chaput explained that his goal was “to offer some lessons from the American experience that Irish Christians might find useful.” More than three decades after the legalization of abortion in the U.S., Archbishop Chaput diagnosed Americans’ beliefs on abortion as schizophrenic as he gave an overview of the current situation. “Most believe abortion is wrong. But most also want it legal under some limited circumstances,” he said. The consequences of holding two such divergent views are that the U.S. has “a large and well-funded abortion industry” and that a “very vigorous prolife movement” has grown up “right alongside the abortion industry,” Chaput observed. “American pro-lifers have had many setbacks. They never have enough money. They don't get treated fairly by the media. Too many of their leaders argue with each other too much of the time. But they just won't give up or die. And so they've won quite a few modest but important legal victories. Meanwhile they continue to work toward the strategic goal of overturning the 1973 Supreme Court decision.” With all of this in mind, Archbishop Chaput offered what he sees as six “don’ts” and five “dos” that pro-lifers around the world should learn from their American counterparts.<br /><br />

The irony of this relationship, however, might escape some people. I cannot see how a relationship can actually exist between people’s supposed belief in God, their apparent willingness to overlook what abortion does to children and negotiating ways to supposedly reduce the death count rather than eliminate it. I must be missing something.<br /><br />
I find it interesting that when the president discussed this proposed White House office prior to his election, he never mentioned that one of the office’s activities would be exploring ways to reduce abortion. In fact, in one particular address, </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3498&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">he told his audience</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, <br /></font></strong></p><blockquote><strong><font size="3">You know, faith based groups like East Side Community Ministry carry a particular meaning for me. Because in a way, they're what led me into public service. It was a Catholic group called The Campaign for Human Development that helped fund the work I did many years ago in Chicago to help lift up neighborhoods that were devastated by the closure of a local steel plant.</font></strong></blockquote><p><strong><font size="3">Imagine it! A Catholic group funded the work of a man who has now taken the position that he not only supports abortion unequivocally, but also believes it should be available without hindrance. This is precisely why he supports things like the Prevention First Act.<br /><br />
In that same speech, Obama outlined his plan to have the organizations and church groups that do understand the intricacies of working within the parameters of a federal grant teach those that don't, and once again, he mentioned a Catholic organization – this time, Catholic Charities.<br /><br />
Somehow, he appears to enjoy the idea of co-opting Catholic identity by aligning the word Catholic with his less-than-wholesome positions on matters like aborting little children. In case anyone thinks this reference to Catholic organizations is accidental, think again!<br /><br />
The most frightening part of that speech, though, was this line: </font></strong></p><blockquote><strong><font size="3">Every house of worship that wants to run an effective program and that's willing to abide by our constitution – from the largest mega-churches and synagogues to the smallest store-front churches and mosques – can and will have access to the information and support they need to run that program.</font></strong></blockquote><p><strong><font size="3">As a constitutional lawyer, the president knows that there are a wide variety of interpretations regarding the actual meaning of "separation of church and state." He also knows that those who favor abortion have argued for three decades or more that </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3496&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">opposition to abortion is a religious belief</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> and the government must not pander to pro-lifers for that reason. <br /><br />
I, for one, can imagine that, under Obama’s interpretation of the doctrine of separation of church and state, there would be little acceptance for those people of faith who actually define the questions regarding the act of abortion in terms that are accurate, comprehensive and relate directly to God's creative authority. My sense is that deeply faith-filled people are going to have a hard time if they and their projects choose to be part of his new program. <br /><br />
Further, if one objectively examines </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3474&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Obama's words of July 2008</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, versus what the Obama staff is saying now, "on the condition of anonymity," there is every reason to be exceedingly concerned about the fate of only God knows how many preborn children. <br /><br />
For example, the anonymous “senior White House aide” is quoted as saying that the White House wants to "change the dialogue" and search out "common-sense, common-ground approaches to difficult problems."<br /><br />
Now let me see if I can translate that for you. The idea that a mother has a constitutional right to kill or not to kill her baby as long as that baby is not born will continue to be the foundational principle for any "change" in dialogue or any conversation employing the Obama version of "common sense." After all, it's "a woman's choice." And clearly, the existence of the preborn child is a "difficult problem" that the White House Office on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships will address in ways acceptable to the president and his men.<br /><br />
There will be, without a doubt, no mention that abortion is an act with a deadly result. After all, the kind of dialogue Obama's staff is considering leaves out any discussion of right versus wrong, life versus death, personhood versus non-personhood or good versus evil. Such terms would be considered inflammatory in a White House that is working to create a new paradigm. The problem with all this is not so much that the president's spokespeople are discussing this, but that some members of the Evangelical and Catholic communities are applauding the effort.<br /><br />
All the mumbo-jumbo sickens me, because it places verbal gymnastics at the center of the subterfuge that is designed to make everybody feel good about Obama’s plans. Such gibberish leaves science and logic far behind. Why else would the director of the </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3501&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Life Cycle Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> at Catholic University&#160;tell the Washington Post, upon hearing of Obama’s efforts to appease both pro-lifers and pro-aborts, "The stars are beginning to align" in this "unique political moment." <br /><br />
What in the world does that have to do with facing the facts and dealing with the tragedy produced by 36 years of aborting little babies?<br /><br />
In my humble opinion, the “stars” that are aligning are all grisly, gruesome and ghastly. The cultural atmosphere in our nation at this moment reeks of the stench of death, as some applaud the efforts being made by the president to "change the dialogue."<br /><br />
One need only read a news report or two about abortion to discover that the new paradigm is already active. The philosophical framework underlying the paradigm is all too clear. Here are a couple of questions to help you see what I mean.<br /><br />
How can you say the state of </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3473&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">California is training midwives and physicians’ assistants to "perform 'suction aspiration' surgical abortion procedures</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">" in a way that does not translate into death for the younger patient? You simply don't mention the truth about abortion.<br /><br />
How does one make the statement that a </font></strong><a href="http://nvs.all.org/sendstudio/link.php?M=96913&amp;N=704&amp;L=3493&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Utah "ban" on abortion</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;is actually going to end all abortion in the state, when the language of the bill states that abortion will continue, "in limited cases to protect the mothers' life, prevent permanent damage to her physical health, or in cases of rape or incest?" You simply don't define the word "ban," but if Merriam-Webster's definition of the word "ban" still reads, "to prohibit," then where is the truth in the description of this bill? You’ve got it … It simply is not there. <br /><br />
And yes, I am saying that there are pro-lifers who are as guilty of this game as are the pro-aborts. This is why some are applauding the Obama proposal. The political world surrounding abortion has become a discussion about abstract concepts that have nothing to do with a real baby, real blood and real death.<br />
It really frightens me when I think about the ways in which language is being so badly abused. I wonder if anyone really knows what the words they hear or read mean, or worse, if they actually care at all.<br /><br />

By Judie Brown</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Science and technology have made enormous contributions to our lives and society. But the fact that a certain procedure is technologically possible does not make it ethically right. “In vitro” literally means “in glass.” In vitro fertilization is a process whereby human life is generated in a laboratory environment such as a glass petri dish.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The process of IVF begins when fertility technicians administer hormone treatments to a woman. The hormones hyper-stimulate the woman’s ovaries to produce a number of eggs at one time. The eggs are collected from the woman’s body and fertilized. The resulting embryos are nourished in laboratory cultures and inserted into the woman’s body with the hope that one embryo will successfully implant in the lining of the womb and develop. The process is very controlled and involves numerous trips to the IVF clinic.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The Jones Institute, one of the pioneers of IVF, reports that only 10 to 20% of the human embryos produced by IVF ever result in a normal pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that in 2003, 48,000 babies were born through IVF in the United States. This means that 240,000 – 480,000 human embryos are missing from the equation for that year alone.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">• Many embryos die in the transfer process since they are fragile.<br />
• Some embryos are unwanted and eliminated because they are considered genetically inadequate.<br />
• Some embryos are stored alive in freezers.<br />
• Some embryos are simply killed as they are washed down the sink.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">It is a scientific fact that human life begins at the first moment of biological inception. At that point, the human embryo has a complete genetic code, and his or her growth and development are totally coordinated from within. When this fundamental moral line is violated or obscured, categories of people become devalued and they become easily used for utilitarian purposes.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">No one has the “right” to a child—even the most loving of couples. IVF turns children into commodities. When a couple undergoes IVF, they are saying, “We want a child no matter what,” and the child becomes an object. This evolves into a selective mentality, whereby couples choose the kind of child they want. Above all, a child is a gift. Cooperating with God’s plan for human procreation ensures that all children are accepted as gifts. IVF is wrong because it separates human procreation from marital union.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Spousal union is expressed both spiritually and physically.&#160; And at the same time, the procreative dimension yields both spiritual benefits and physical fruits. When marriage is physically fruitful, a couple participates in God’s creative act instead of dominating it.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Once IVF is accepted, there is no substantial reason to oppose cloning. Both take human procreation out of the context of conjugal union. IVF begins the slippery slope that leads to cloning, eugenics and experimentation on human embryos.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">American Life League’s Federal Personhood Amendment is written specifically to establish the legal personhood of all human beings from the beginning of their biological development irrespective of the method of reproduction, whether in vivo or in vitro.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The Federal Personhood Amendment is unlike all other pro-life legislation in that it guarantees the right to life of ALL people from the moment of creation until natural death.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><strong>News</strong></font></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3"><em>Pro-life people must not lose heart with Obama election says Vatican archbishop</em><br />

I have also learned that there are people, especially on the pro-death side of the debate, who go to great lengths to intentionally misuse words, in order to mislead the listener. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">The variety of words used to describe when a human being's life actually begins is a very good example of what I mean. Let's start with "conception," because that is where I started. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">When I was a novice in this work, I thought—as did everybody I knew—that "conception," the act of conceiving a child, was the beginning of a person's life. So, in the mid-1970s, when it first came to my attention that the word now had a couple of meanings, I looked into it. What I learned horrified me.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">You see, many medical dictionaries, doctors and clinical researchers no longer think of the word "conception" as the moment when the human sperm and the human egg unite in the woman's fallopian tube. For example, MedicineNet.com's popular online dictionary defines "conception" thus: "1. The union of the sperm and the ovum. Synonymous with fertilization. 2. The onset of pregnancy, marked by implantation of the blastocyst into the endometrium."</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Notice that the first definition differs markedly from the second definition, and that the second ignores conception as defined in the first and tells the reader that the actual pregnancy does not begin until eight days after it has begun—at the moment of implantation in the woman's womb! In other words, the two definitions directly contradict each other. But how many of us have gone along with the use of both definitions without realizing what was happening in the process? Now there are even states where "conception" is legally defined—erroneously—as beginning at implantation. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">At a 1959 Planned Parenthood-Population Council symposium, Swedish researcher Bent Boving noted that "the social advantage of being considered to prevent conception rather than to destroy an established pregnancy could depend upon something so simple as a prudent habit of speech."</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Obviously, the intent to deceive the public about the abortion-causing nature of anti-fertility control drugs and devices was widespread. At the 1964 Population Council symposium, Dr. Samuel Wishik pointed out that acceptance or rejection of birth control would depend on whether it causes an early abortion. Dr. Christopher Tietze, of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council, suggested, as a public relations ploy, "not to disturb those people for whom this is a question of major importance." Tietze added that theologians and jurists have always taken the prevailing biological and medical consensus of their times as factual and that "if a medical consensus develops and is maintained that pregnancy, and therefore life, begins at implantation, eventually our brethren from the other faculties will listen." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">And in 1965, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology published a new Terminology Bulletin that stated, "Conception is the implantation of the fertilized ovum." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">So, there you have it. We concluded that we could no longer say "conception" without saying "fertilization." To do otherwise was to agree with the culture of death that, since pregnancy does not begin until implantation, the child prior to implantation is simply not really there at all!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">But the plot now thickens even more. Enter the sadistic scientists who have no problem telling us that, because there are so many in vitro fertilization embryos sitting around in a freezer somewhere, they have devised a way to put them all to good use. They will use their stem cells, thus killing each of them in the process; and help us learn how to cure disease, grow extra body parts and stop the aging process, to mention but a few of their bogus claims. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Not only that, but they will manipulate human and animal cells, and in the process, clone or otherwise asexually reproduce human beings or maybe even a human-animal chimera along the way, to use their stem cells as well. Regardless of what they call it, the fact is that in today's fast-moving era of science for the sake of profit, the human being is at even greater risk. For those of us working for the pro-life cause, this means that our language has to be even more precise than it was previously.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">So, what to do? Well, at American Life League, we are doing everything we can to make sure that every human being, regardless of his point of origin, is protected by law and the Constitution. The proposed Federal Personhood Amendment that we support states, therefore, that regardless of how human beings come into existence—whether by sexual or asexual means, whether in vitro or in vivo, whether disabled or not—they are to be treated as persons, and all of the rights the Creator has bestowed on each and every person—born and preborn—are to be recognized and protected.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">Clearly, the situation has changed dramatically over the past 35 years, and had I realized then what I do now, I would have been speechless and terrified.

The common terms used to refer to the moment that a human being's life begins are "fertilization" and "conception." We encourage you to reconsider the use of these terms for the following reasons.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Fertilization is now only one method of reproducing members of the human species. It is a medically accurate term but not sufficient, because humans are now also created artificially, that is, by asexual means not involving fertilization. To use the term "fertilization" when referring to the moment that a new human being comes into existence would consequently exclude from this document's intended scope a whole class of people who are reproduced asexually. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Although "conception" is commonly used by the general public, it is expressly and universally rejected as a scientific term by embryologists, scientists and medical professionals, and thus does not adequately support the concept of personhood. In addition, the term is not always understood to refer to the act of fertilization and is often erroneously taken to mean “implantation.” In many states, as well as in literally dozens of national and international medical and research organizations (including the American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians), the term "conception" is defined as "beginning at implantation." ACOG adopted this new definition in 1965 in response to political pressures and not as a result of scientific discovery.&#160; Thus, since the personhood movement aims to recognize all human beings, precise, unambiguous and scientifically accurate terminology is indispensable and of the utmost importance.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Instead of using the aforementioned terms, use the term point of creation instead of conception, or even fertilization. If explaining when a person comes into existence, explain that human embryology experts recognize that the life of each human being begins at his or her biological beginning or biological inception.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><u><em><strong><font size="3">The Federal Personhood Amendment is unlike all other pro-life legislation in that it guarantees the right to life of ALL people from the moment of creation until natural death.</font></strong></em></u></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="3">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Study links water pollution from contraceptives, chemicals with declining male fertility<br /></em>New research strengthens the link between water pollution and rising male fertility problems.

Study Links Water Pollution from Contraceptives, Chemicals with Declining Male Fertility<br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3344%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/jan/09011901.html</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">Life Site News <br /></font></span>New research strengthens the link between water pollution and rising male fertility problems. The study, by Brunel University, the Universities of Exeter and Reading and the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, shows for the first time how a group of testosterone-blocking chemicals is finding its way into UK rivers, affecting wildlife and potentially humans. The research was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council and is now published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. The study identified a new group of chemicals that act as ‘anti-androgens.’ This means that they inhibit the function of the male hormone, testosterone, reducing male fertility. Some of these are contained in medicines, including cancer treatments, pharmaceutical treatments, and pesticides used in agriculture. The research suggests that when they get into the water system, these chemicals may play a pivotal role in causing feminising effects in male fish. Earlier research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter has shown how female sex hormones (estrogens), and chemicals that mimic estrogens, are leading to ‘feminisation’ of male fish. Found in some industrial chemicals and the contraceptive pill, they enter rivers via sewage treatment works. This causes reproductive problems by reducing fish breeding capability and in some cases can lead to male fish changing sex. Other studies have also suggested that there may be a link between this phenomenon and the increase in human male fertility problems caused by testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Until now, this link lacked credence because the list of suspects causing effects in fish was limited to estrogenic chemicals whilst testicular dysgenesis is known to be caused by exposure to a range of anti-androgens. <br /><br /><font color="#ff0000"><em>ALL Report</em>: "FOCA in Focus"</font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3"><span>American Life League explains the dangers of the Freedom of Choice Act for preborn babies throughout the country. </span><br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To view the report on </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D2936%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">blip.tv</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> (higher quality version), go to&#160;</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3238%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://blip.tv/file/1650006</font></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D2875%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">.</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;To watch the video on YouTube (please understand, we can't control the related content there), go to </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3240%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=347F1aHx5yg</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. <br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the <em>ALL Report</em> through an RSS feed, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D1834%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://allreport.blip.tv/rss</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the <em>ALL Report</em> via iTunes, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank"><strong><font size="3">itpc://ALLReport.blip.tv/rss/itunes/</font></strong></a><strong><font size="1"><font size="3"> <br /></font><br /></font></strong><strong><font size="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Register now!&#160; The 25th Anniversary of the Baby Doe Rules: Perspectives from the Fields of Law, Health Care, Ethics and Disability Policy</span><br /></font></strong></span></font></span></span></font><u><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="1">FEATURE STORY</font></strong></u></span><strong><font size="1"> </font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;<strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">ALL Associate Newsletter</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;P</font><font size="4">ro-Life Today | 15 January 2009</font></strong></p><p><em><strong><font size="3"><u>Your National Daily News Wrap from American Life League!</u> American Life League is the largest grassroots pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.

In its largest-ever state-based initiative, the Family Research Council is contacting every state lawmaker in the country with a plea to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, one of the nation's largest providers of family planning and abortion services.&#160; Their argument is fairly simple: lots of organizations need public money now, but Planned Parenthood -- with a $1 billion budget and a $114 million operating surplus -- isn't one of them. "Planned Parenthood has proven that they don't need federal or state handouts," says Tom McClusky, vice president for government affairs at the Washington-based FRC. "During these economic times, when states are rethinking their investments, subsidizing abortion is probably not the kind of thing that they want to be known for."<br /><br />

It is good to hear from you. As you are aware, abortion is a difficult and divisive issue, but one on which I have a firm position. <br /><span style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">[Abortion is an act that takes the life of a human being.] </span><br /><br />

By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As you may recall, we have begun relating real-life stories about various school districts and their encounters with Planned Parenthood.&#160;With School District #1, the fight involved removing a Planned Parenthood “educator” from the school system and was successful over a relatively short period of time.&#160;This case highlighted some important tips on approaching a school board with one’s concerns.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">With School District #2, the fight involved the removal of a child abuse counseling program developed and to be implemented by Planned Parenthood.&#160;The parents in this case were facing an entrenched school board and the local media were heavily on the side of Planned Parenthood.&#160;At one point, it seemed as though the parents had actually lost since the board eventually voted to adopt the program.&#160;However, this case is a prime example of how God rewards faithful efforts and creates victory out of apparent defeat.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The parents in School District #2 used letters-to-the-editor to arouse community support and solicited the help of their own children to show that the community did not want Planned Parenthood in the schools.&#160;Despite the board’s vote, the large public outcry forced the board to develop a school access policy which included the concerns of parent leaders.&#160;It also led to a greater recognition on the part of the school board of the proper role of parents in the decision process of the school. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Approximately three years after the fight over the child abuse counseling program, the parents scored another tremendous victory against the pro-abortion forces.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">During that time, a state commission tried to get local groups to sponsor education programs that would bring attention to the U.S. Constitution.&#160;A small group of people in this school district, who apparently were pro-abortion, saw this as a chance to bring attention to the abortion issue and to get children in the local schools to write pro-abortion essays.&#160;To accomplish this, they received a $1,000 grant and developed an essay contest.&#160;The essays could be written on one of two topics:&#160;“Non-Partisan vs. Partisan Elections in Village and Town” or “Reproductive Rights.”&#160;The guide for the “Reproductive Rights” essay was a five page “fact” sheet.&#160;All of the sources for the fact sheet information, it was noted, were either Planned Parenthood or organizations, literature or research groups that were, in fact, pro-death!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">As the pro-abortion people hatched their plan, they were shocked to find that they could not get access to the public schools.&#160;Because of the previously agreed Access Policy, these people did not qualify and could not get to the kids through the schools!&#160;They were, of course, outraged, but could do nothing about it.&#160;And, without access to the children, the pro-abortion plans began to fall apart. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">They did go ahead with the essay contest and announced the winner at a town meeting.&#160;The announcement was given little fanfare or attention – no mention of the title or the contents – either at the meeting or in the local newspaper.&#160;But, it was available at the library – “HUMAN LIFE AND PERSONHOOD.”&#160;Yes, it was definitely a pro-life essay!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Thus, the parents who fought the child abuse counseling program not only won all they sought, but the results of their victories were being felt several years later.&#160;This series of events points out a number of additional things which can be done by people who are fighting school programs:</font></strong></p><ol><li><strong><font size="3">If the school board will not listen to you, do not be afraid to go directly to the community.&#160;Use the letters-to-the-editor column in your local papers to ask pertinent questions and to bring what is going on in the schools to the attention of the community. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">Respond to the arguments of your adversaries on issues that affect the community.&#160;Get the students involved when appropriate and spread the message to an objection of Planned Parenthood in general, not just the specific program involved. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">If you are presented with opportunities to have an effect on school policy (such as with an Access Policy), take them.&#160;You never know when they will be beneficial to your goals. </font></strong></li><li><strong><font size="3">Finally, the most important point for any fight against the school, don’t count your victories and losses by the vote of the school board.&#160;Your job is NOT to win school board votes – your job is to proclaim the truth.&#160;The task at hand is to rouse the people of the community and to get them out to the school board meeting, get them to write letters and sign petitions – to get the community involved.&#160;If you have done this, you have won regardless of how the school board votes. </font></strong></li></ol><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Too many people judge their success or failure by the outcome of the vote.&#160;This is what Planned Parenthood does and they understand it completely.&#160;What they do not understand is, people who lose the school board vote and still fight as strong as ever.&#160;They don’t understand this unselfish dedication on the part of parents for no apparent material gain.&#160;And, since they don’t understand it, they cannot fight it.&#160;They are helpless against truly dedicated parents who simply will not give up. So, don’t give up. Keep fighting and God will win!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><font color="#ff0000" size="5"><strong>News</strong></font></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font color="#ff0000" size="3">Vatican newspaper publishes article detailing birth control pill as cause of abortion and cancer</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The Vatican’s official newspaper has caused a media storm in the European press with an article asserting the abortifacient and carcinogenic effects of hormonal contraceptives. <br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3179%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/jan/09010504.html</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><em><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><strong>Birth-control pill is linked to male infertility, says Vatican paper</strong></font></em></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The birth-control pill is causing "devastating" environmental damage and plays a role in rising male infertility rates, said the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano.<br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3260%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900033.htm</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font color="#ff0000" size="3">Merck seeks FDA approval for HPV vaccine use in boys, young men</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Merck is seeking FDA approval for the use of its human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil, for boys and young men ages nine to 26. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3178%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/News2?abbr=daily2_&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=14679&amp;security=1201&amp;news_iv_ctrl=-1</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font size="3">Parish’s big victories</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">When pro-life messages and actions are consistent and regular, pro-life fruits are sweet and abundant. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D659%2526L%253D3259%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/16803/</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><strong><em><font size="3">Mother has healthy baby boy despite abortion warning by doctor</font></em></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Gaynor Purdy was warned her first child could have a fatal chromosome defect and a life threatening heart condition.

Executives at Planned Parenthood confirmed the layoffs, but declined to give more details. “As with many other nonprofit organizations, Planned Parenthood has had to make staff reductions at our headquarters due to the challenging economic times facing our country,” said Maryana Iskander, chief operating officer at the agency. “While taking this action is never easy, we want to ensure the millions of women and men who rely on Planned Parenthood as a health care provider that the reductions will not impact our ability to deliver care to those in need.” Part of Planned Parenthood’s funding declines stem from the closing of the Florida-based Picower Foundation, which shut down in December because its assets were managed by Bernard Madoff. The $1 billion foundation was one of the few major funders of reproductive rights issues.<br /><br />

The focus is on enlightening journalists on health issues that plague blacks, such as mental health issues from incarceration, heart disease, breast cancer, strokes, HIV/AIDS and childhood obesity. No mention of a procedure that ends one out of every three black pregnancies? According to the Guttmacher Institute, which compiles reproductive health statistics, black women abort their children at five times the white rate and twice the Hispanic rate. The rate is 11 abortions per 1,000 white women, 28 for every 1,000 Hispanic women and 50 for every 1,000 black women. I contacted the NABJ and asked why there was not at least one workshop on this topic. Everyone knows abortion is connected to health care. <br /><br />

In an article published by the Vatican this week, the head of the world's Catholic doctors broadened the attack on the pill, claiming it had also brought "devastating ecological effects" by releasing into the environment "tonnes of hormones" that had impaired male fertility, The Taiwan Times says.&#160;The assault began with a personal commentary in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard by Carl Djerassi. The Austrian chemist was one of three whose formulation of the synthetic progestogen Norethisterone marked a key step toward the earliest oral contraceptive pill.&#160;Djerassi outlined the "horror scenario" that occurred because of the population imbalance, for which his invention was partly to blame. He said that in most of Europe there was now "no connection at all between sexuality and reproduction." He said: "This divide in Catholic Austria, a country which has on average 1.4 children per family, is now complete."&#160; He described families who had decided against reproduction as "wanting to enjoy their schnitzels while leaving the rest of the world to get on with it."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">“Puberty blockers” pushed on children</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D3256%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=85628</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">World Net Daily<br /></font></span>The sexualization of tots in diapers has been ongoing since Alfred Kinsey bragged of infant orgasms in 1948, kicking off Playboy's infant-and-child sex vignettes in 1954. After the late 1960s, schoolhouse administrators increasingly trained children in Planned Parenthood texts to engage in "outlet" sex, homosexuality, bisexuality and pornography use.&#160;Millions of children did as they were educated and became sexually promiscuous. This opened the door to Big Pharma when, in 1992, the State began mandating an improperly tested venereal-disease vaccine, HepB, for neonates. Big Pharma neglected to inform mom and dad that one commonly gets HepB from sexual contact with a vector. The Imperial State now mandates yet another improperly tested STD vaccine, HPV, to allegedly protect "tweens" from cervical cancer.&#160;&#160;"Follow the money." No moral society finds STDs rife among its chaste or its children. Now, as we await Big Pharma's next batch of children's STD vaccines, "The Endocrine Society has published guidelines advising that children as young as 12 be offered puberty blocking drugs to 'buy time' for a gender change."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Second-Guessing Prevention First</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D3251%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=WU09A03&amp;f=PG07J01</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">Family Research Council<br /></font></span>On the first day of the 111th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sent a very clear message about what pro-lifers can expect from the next two years by introducing S. 21, "The Prevention First Act" that would direct hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to the abortion industry, a business that already receives over $286 million each year from federal taxpayers. It should come as no surprise that Planned Parenthood, the largest supporter of unrestricted abortion, praised the bill. And why not? The abortion merchant will likely be the largest beneficiary of Reid's abortion bailout.&#160;Among other things, the legislation would use taxpayer funds to mislead people about the potential of the "morning after pill" (known as Plan B) to act as an abortifacient. It also encourages the use of Plan B for victims of sexual assault yet has no reporting requirement in place for young girls who may have been victims of abuse and/or rape. When you get right down to it, the bill does nothing to support parental involvement--let alone consent--for dispensing the morning after pill and other "contraception" to minors.&#160;In addition to funding Plan B, the measure would also: subsidize birth control for college and low-income women; expand Title X, the main federal family planning program that requires abortion referrals; expand Planned Parenthood targeting of low-income women through Medicaid; target teens' with "comprehensive" sex education; and spread emergency contraception.<br /><br /><font color="#800000">ALL Report: FOCA in Focus</font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3"><span>American Life League explains the dangers of the Freedom of Choice Act for preborn babies throughout the country. </span><br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To view the report on </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D2936%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">blip.tv</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> (higher quality version), go to&#160;</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D3238%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://blip.tv/file/1650006</font></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D2875%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">.</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">&#160;To watch the video on YouTube (please understand, we can't control the related content there), go to </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D3240%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=347F1aHx5yg</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. <br /><br /></font></strong><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#000000"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the ALL Report through an RSS feed, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D658%2526L%253D1834%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">http://allreport.blip.tv/rss</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3">To subscribe to the ALL Report via iTunes, click here: </font></strong><a target="_blank"><strong><font size="3">itpc://ALLReport.blip.tv/rss/itunes/</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> </font></strong></span></font></span></span><br /></font></span></p><p><u style="font-size: 14pt"><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="3">FEATURE STORY</font></strong></u></p><p><strong><font size="3">THE GRAMMAR OF RIGHT THINKING<br /></font></strong><em><strong><font size="3">By Judie Brown<br /><br /></font></strong></em></p><p><strong><font size="3">Not a day passes&#160;without one headline or another grabbing my attention and riveting me to a search engine on my computer, sort of like a mad dog! &#160;But I learned that one of the best ways to share the undeniable truths that are not yours or mine, but God’s, is to focus on those aspects of daily life that prompt us to think about what kind of people we are.

Yet also, and this is the crucial point, because of an overwhelming and isolating sense of shame. Almost from the moment I awoke from the anesthetic, I have deeply regretted my decision.

But instead of getting her Christmas miracle, a healthy baby boy named Bashir, Moore's son was stillborn. Devastated, the young mother left her baby's remains in the care of the hospital and went home. When she came back to claim him, the hospital couldn't find his body. That's right, you heard me, the Christ Hospital claimed it couldn't find Bashir. ..&#160;<br />

How does a hospital lose an infant's body?&#160;<br />

If that wasn't bad enough, Moore says police told her that her son had accidentally been thrown in the trash; tossed away like garbage. How in the world could that happen? Surely, medical professionals can tell the difference between a little black boy and a pile of trash, right? Apparently, not because now officials are searching dumps in New Jersey and Pennsylvania looking for Bashir's remains. <br />

The right to life and to the free expression of personal faith in God is not subject to the power of man.

Pedro Jose Maria Simon Castellvi, President of the International Federation of Catholic Medical Associations (FIAMC), writes that "we have sufficient data to affirm that one of the reasons for the not insignificant rise in male infertility in the west (due to increasingly fewer sperm in men), is the environmental contamination caused by 'the pill'." "We are confronted with a clear anti-ecological effect that demands further explanation from the manufacturers," continued Castellvi, who also noted that the abortifacient and carcinogenic effects of the contraceptive pill are also well known. Castellvi's statements echo similar utterances made by numerous other medical and scientific experts since 2004.&#160; Female hormones from birth control pills, which enter the water supply through urination, are being blamed for declining sperm counts in human and animal populations, the growth of female sex organs in male fish, breast growth in young men, and early onset of puberty in young girls.&#160;<br /><br />

In the letter, ADF lawyer Thomas Bowman wrote that "[m]any ... employees" believe that performing abortion procedures at the center would "severely upset regular patients, disrupt the respected surgical practice that currently occurs there, decimate employee morale, require burdensome policy changes and compel direct or indirect staff participation" in the procedures. A second antiabortion-rights group, Pro-life Wisconsin [an American Life League Associate group], issued a statement saying that its members would regularly protest outside the clinic if it opens, adding, "We strongly urge [the university] to abandon this morally reprehensible, potentially illegal plan." <br /><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#0000ff">See also:&#160; "Secret" Plans for University of Wisconsin Mid-term Abortion Clinic Revealed </font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3199%2526F%253DH"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=92887</font></a><font color="#0000ff"> </font></span></font></p><p><br /><br /><font size="3">Invest in Abortion - Planned Parenthood’s post-Christmas wish</font></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3204%2526F%253DH"><font size="3">http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTljNWYwZTRjMTU3ZTgzYmRkMjBjMTZkNTVhNjc2OGY</font></a><font size="3">=<br /></font><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">National Review<br /></font></span>Among the many left-wing interests that have submitted wish lists to the Obama transition team is a conglomeration of 50 abortion-advocacy groups, all of whom want the U.S. taxpayer to stand and deliver. When their 55-page report to Obama calls for an end to “ideologically driven government restrictions,” it really means that the government should be paying more of the bills for groups that advocate and perform abortions. To provide some context, the government has been “bailing out” Big Abortion for years. Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, feeds off the taxpayer to the tune of $337 million in government funds that would otherwise have to come from donors. If the recommendations in this report are enacted, they and other abortion providers and advocates will have even more spoils upon which to feast.<br /><br />

Thus the federal government found it necessary to make clear its intentions not to upset the hedonistic family-planning giant. In fact, </font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3203%2526F%253DH"><font size="3">Health and Human Services</font></a><font size="3"> was quite specific, stating,&#160;&#160;</font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font size="3">After the full consideration of Comments on this issue [a clear definition of abortion], the Department declines to add a definition of abortion to the rule. As indicated by the Comments, such questions over the nature of abortion and the ending of a life are highly controversial and strongly debated. The Department believes it can enforce the federal health care conscience protection laws without an abortion definition just as the Department has enforced Hyde Amendment, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, Div. G, Sec. Sec. 507, 508(a)-(c), 121 Stat. 1844, 2208 (Dec. 26, 2007), abortion funding restrictions without a formal definition. Additionally, nothing in this rule alters the obligation of federal Title X programs to deliver contraceptive services to clients in need as authorized by law and regulation.&#160;</font></p><p><font size="3">In other words, the new regulation honors the conscientious objection of those who, because of religious belief or moral conviction, will not participate in medical or surgical abortion, and the regulation obviously provides the same protection for those who do perform such procedures. There is nothing ostensibly pro-life in the regulation.<br /><br />
Thus the regulation is pabulum, pure and simple, hiding behind words like "controversial" and "strongly debated" rather than defining that a human being begins at his beginning and therefore some forms of contraception are in fact abortive. Chicken Little lives. But not so, according to commentaries in leading newspapers, including the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3195%2526F%253DH">St. Louis Post Dispatch</a></em>, which editorialized, "Under the rule, pharmacists are allowed to refuse to fill a prescription for contraceptives or for medications associated with medical abortion. A doctor can refuse to tell a pregnant patient about the availability of abortion even if the patient asks about it and even if a continued pregnancy threatens the patient's&#160;life."&#160;<br /><br />
Given the fact that the rule does not define abortion and insists that recipients of Title X funding must provide contraceptive services, I have to ask if the Post Dispatch editorial writer(s) actually read the regulation or merely chose to make wild claims about aspects of the regulation that are either nonexistent or watered down to the point of being meaningless. <br /><br />
Of course, a more plausible explanation for this disingenuous attack is that the <em>Post-Dispatch</em> and its ilk are laying the groundwork for the Obama administration to employ the same arguments, in order to overturn the regulation.That is just the sort of trickery that likely future HHS secretary </font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3153%2526F%253DH"><font size="3">Tom Daschle</font></a><font size="3">&#160; is good at, as we all know.</font></p><p><br /><font size="3">As </font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D651%2526L%253D3196%2526F%253DH"><font size="3">Nancy Valko</font></a><font size="3">, RN, said in her letter to the editor of the St. Louis newspaper,&#160;&#160;</font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font size="3">As a registered nurse for almost 40 years, I am shocked that the editorial "Unconscionable" (Dec. 24) would suggest that doctors, nurses and pharmacists with ethical objections to participating in certain procedures or treatments just "choose another profession."

We deny conscience rights at our own peril.&#160;</font></p><p><font size="3">What specifically is it that the "mainstream" media wants from the federal government? I have a feeling I know the answer. They want a policy that basically states that&#160;nobody in the healthcare profession who is committed to defending and protecting innocent human persons need apply! There is no other possible conclusion! When so much protest can be raised over the simple matter of making certain that freedom of conscience applies equally across the board to those who will kill as well as those who will not kill, something is drastically wrong. <br /><br />
The problem is that too few see the rising tide of morbid ideology that underlies commentaries such as that published by the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>. One hopes that this situation will change before it is too late. If it does not, eventually the circus could turn into a spectacle at which people of conviction are fed to bloodthirsty lions.

Robert G. Marshall and Jim Sedlak</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">As we mentioned in last week’s newsletter, one of the aims of the Prevention First Act is to make Title X, or family planning, a permanent government program and fund it at $700 million or more. Many people wonder precisely what Title X is and what it does. Here we begin a series to answer those questions:</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Title X is a government program, contained in the authorization and appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services. It is a “family planning” program that has become the source of various projects for the dispensation of birth control, referral for abortion and promotion of in-school and on-campus sex education programs and school-based clinics.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Title X of the Public Health Service Act was passed first in 1970 and was called Tydings Act. The argument in 1970 for passing this bill was that the bill was needed to “reduce the number of illegitimate births and the medical and psychological complications for both mother and child often resulting from them.” (According to the Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, the rates of out-of-wedlock births among teenage girls ages 15-19 has only increased since the passage of this Act!)</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">The recipients of Title X funds include state health departments, affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and other facilities that provide birth control counseling, birth control devices, health education services and sex education. School-based clinics and off-campus clinics designed to provide counseling on matters relating to reproductive health, also receive funding from Title X.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Is there really a connection between Title X and abortion? There is. The program funds abortion – thousands of abortions. Title X provides funding for chemical abortions as well as funding for organizations that promote abortion.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Frank Susman, the lawyer who represented the pro-abortion position before the U.S. Supreme Court, stated in oral argument:</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal" align="center"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">For better or for worse, there no longer exists any bright line between the fundamental right that was established in <em>Griswold</em> and the fundamental right of abortion that was established in <em>Roe</em>. These two rights, because of advances in medicine and science, now overlap. They coalesce and merge and they are not distinct. The most common forms of contraception today – IUDs, low-dose birth prevention pills … act as abortifacients.</span></font></font></p><p style="line-height: normal" align="center"><font size="3">&#160;</font></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">An abortifacient is a chemical or a device that causes abortion in the first days or weeks of a human being’s life in the womb. Title X provides funding for the provision of these birth control methods that act, at least partially, to abort. Therefore, Title X does fund abortion.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Additionally, it is a well-documented fact that organizations such as the affiliates of Planned Parenthood specialize in referring for abortion, have abortionists on staff in many locations and are promoters of abortion as an antidote to “unwanted” pregnancy. Therefore the money that these organizations get from the federal government can be used to offset expenditures for surgical abortion and abortion counseling.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Since its inception in 1970, Title X of the Health and Human Services Act has always been a major funding source for Planned Parenthood. Title X was funded at $300 million for fiscal year 2008. Planned Parenthood receives about 25 percent of the total, or $75 million. Thus, the PFA would more than double the tax dollars given to Planned Parenthood ($175 million) by this one program – in addition to making Title X permanent.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">&#160;&#160;</font></p><h1><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#ff0000" size="3">News</font></span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">Pro-abortion med student shrinks away from practice after “disturbingly brutal” procedure</font></span></em></p><p style="background: white" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">Though she had practiced the procedure as a student at the University of Maryland School of Medicine by scraping out a piece of fruit with razor-sharp abortion instruments, Lesley Wojcik learned that her training could never have prepared her for a real abortion.

These components include:</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal" align="center"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span></font><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">• Making Title X (family planning) a permanent program and funding it at $700 million or more. Since its inception in 1970, Title X of the Health and Human Services Act has always been a major funding source for PP. However, Title X is not a permanent program and must be reauthorized every year. Title X was funded at $300 million for fiscal year 2008. PP receives about 25 percent of the total or $75 million. Thus, the PFA would more than double the tax dollars given to PP ($175 million) by this one program. It would also make Title X a permanent program.</span></font></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in" align="center">&#160;</p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">• Mandating that health insurance programs that cover prescriptions also cover abortifacient contraceptives. The PFA would take away the ability of consumers and insurance companies to seek the coverage they want and would force every insurance plan that covers prescription drugs to pay for birth control. </font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">• Creating a government program to push abortifacient “emergency contraception.” The PFA would create a government-funded five-year “educational” program to promote emergency contraception and drive even more Plan B business to PP.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span></font><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">• Taking all federal money away from any hospital that refuses to administer emergency contraception (an abortifacient), to rape victims.

Under the subprogram named “At-Risk Communities Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act,” the PFA would create a program to conduct research and educational sessions for the purpose of reducing teen pregnancy. All kinds of organizations (e.g. Planned Parenthood) would receive taxpayer funds, and all kinds of theories and ways of preventing teen pregnancy could be researched and taught EXCEPT abstinence-only programs. </span></font></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">&#160;</span><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt">• Permanently including family planning services as part of the Medicaid program. The Medicaid program was never intended to pay for family planning services. Yet, beginning in the 1990s, states started applying for Medicaid waivers to allow them to add family planning for Medicaid-eligible recipients. The federal government has approved these waivers, and their approval must be renewed, on a state-by-state basis, every five years. Because of the waivers, Medicaid is now the largest single program providing taxpayer money for PP. The PFA would do away with the need for waivers and write family planning services permanently into Medicaid, thereby opening the floodgates of taxpayer funding for PP even wider.</span></font></p><p style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font size="3">&#160;</font></span></p><p style="line-height: normal"><em><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><font style="background-color: #ffffff" size="3">What is the status of the Prevention First Act?</font></span></em><span style="font-family: ; font-size: 10pt"><br /><br /><font size="3">It is important to note that the election ushers in a new Congress in January.

This is one of four rules that the congressman not only shared with his political peers, but with pro-life Americans as well. As a Catholic leader, Hyde knew that Catholic teaching does not admit compromise when addressing fundamental truths concerning abortion and the attack on marriage. Hyde rarely had a problem focusing on the nonnegotiable teaching that an act of abortion was never acceptable. His leadership was based on that principle. <br /><br />
Principles, particularly for the God-fearing person, do not change and in fact actually formulate the kind of person we are individually and the kind of culture we strive to nurture and protect collectively. But what happens when there is a flaw in the fabric of principle, a misstep in the defense of never-changing truths?<br /><br />

In his January 10 blog post, he shares the facts about something that happened in Canada regarding same-sex marriage, and it reminded me of what could happen when Obama is sworn in, in a few short days, and starts dealing with abortion. While we are here discussing same-sex marriage in Canada and abortion in America, the scenarios of how the two nations arrived at their current juncture are quite similar.&#160;Here is what Mark wrote:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">I would like to bring readers’ attention to a special reprint of an article entitled "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D661%2526L%253D3268%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">The conspiracy to abolish marriage in Canada</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">: If everything is marriage, then nothing is."&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
When recognition of same-sex marriage was rammed through Canada's Parliament under the Liberal government of Paul Martin, it was not supported as a free vote. Prime Minister Martin invoked strict Party discipline in order to pass the bill. All ministers, parliamentary secretaries and committee Chairs (not to mention back bench MPs) were expected to support the same-sex marriage bill, under threat of losing portfolios, perks, and privileges. Self-interest prevailed for most Liberal MPs: all but a few courageous Members fell into line and voted to recognize homosexual marriage. <br />
&#160;<br />
Was this departure from historical definition of marriage – as between one man and one woman – warranted by stacks of social science or empirical studies validating the advisability of such a change? No. In fact, there were studies showing that children raised in homosexual partner homes have considerable problems. Quite simply, the law was changed on the basis of liberal social fashion (disguised as human rights). <br />
&#160;<br />
Recognition of same-sex marriage (in Canada and abroad) is a deviation from history and wisdom of the ages. It is a dangerous social experiment that threatens to bring down Christian civilization that previous generations fought to preserve. <br />
&#160;<br />
Two major pillars of Christian morality are marriage and the sanctity of human life. Both are being supplanted by secularism, relativism and a neo-paganism. The result has been disastrous to the Christian concept of life's sanctity. Now the marriage pillar is being torn down. Like the article noted at the beginning of this blog says in its title, "If everything is marriage, then nothing is." A primary building block of society will disappear.<br /><br />
Sadly, the dismantling of our [formerly] Christian country has been aided by Christians themselves. So often the Canadian Evangelical response to the destruction of the sanctity of human life ethic has been pale and uncertain.<br /><br />
Now, with the redefinition of marriage, Canadian Evangelicals seem to have thrown up their hands as though the matter was decided. It may have been decided by our liberal courts and political elites, but it has not been decided by ordinary people on main street Canada. They are looking for leadership back to sanity. <br /><br />
Evangelicals seem to have shrunk away with embarrassment from standing resolutely and forcefully against the destruction of traditional marriage by a vociferous and litigious homosexual lobby. Protection of their church charitable status is more important than speaking out against redefinition of marriage or homosexuality. They are afraid of being called names, maligned by the press, or being dragged before a quasi-judicial human rights tribunal. <br />
&#160;<br />
Perhaps I should not be surprised. Canadian Evangelicals have been slow and uncertain to respond against the holocaust of abortion throughout the past 40 years in Canada. I can only presume it [their response] will be equally pale and uncertain with euthanasia. There are courageous exceptions, of course, like the late Pastor Ken Campbell, and the Pentecostal Church, but they are the exceptions.<br /><br />
Denominational policy statements decrying the evil of abortion without persistent and consistent public action, or clearly articulating Biblical and Christian answers outside the church foyer, have failed the sacred cause of life. Will [Evangelicals] be equally timid to make their presence felt defending the Biblical definition of marriage? <br />
&#160;<br />
But timidity has not been the greatest failure of the Evangelical Church; its greatest failure has been accommodation. Rather than transforming the culture with Biblical truth, it has been guilty of accommodating the culture and that ultimately denies the transforming power of Biblical truth.<br /><br />

He addressed this spirit of accommodation: “For the evangelical accommodation to the world of our age represents the removal of the last barrier against the breakdown of our culture. ... To accommodate to the world spirit about us in our age is the most gross form of worldliness in the proper definition of the word.” (p. 141-142) &#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
The great man said the only legitimate response for Christians is confronting the culture –&#160; loving confrontation – but confrontation nonetheless in the crucial moral and social issues of our day. Anything less is a failure to live under the full authority of God's inerrant Word: the Bible. <br />
&#160;<br />
Many Evangelicals avoided <em>The Great Evangelical Disaster</em>. Its truth was also a confrontation – a confrontation many evangelicals are still not willing to admit.<br /><br />
I call upon Canadian Evangelicals to join together with their Catholic brothers and sisters in Christ and spill into the streets in unshakable resolve to reclaim our dying Christian culture. Militate for Biblical morality on the sanctity and dignity of marriage and human life.<br /><br />
Don't worry about being dragged before human rights commissions on bogus charges, losing your tax status or being called names. Previous generations of Christians faced more serious threats for the sake of Biblical truth.<br /><br />
We are in a spiritual war of monumental proportions!&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Mark was an Evangelical prior to converting to Catholicism, and so he understands the Evangelical mindset quite well. The challenge he sets forth in his commentary should not go unnoticed, because we in America, when writing about Catholics and the question of whether or not it is acceptable to murder a preborn child by an act of abortion, are facing precisely the same kind of moral relativism. Lest we forget, Obama is going to be sworn in, in just a few days, in no small measure because more than 50 percent of Catholics cast their vote for him. <br /><br />
Dr. Schaeffer defined such an action as "accommodation to the world." </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D661%2526L%253D3264%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">Pope Benedict XVI</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> has defined it as moral relativism, and he has warned repeatedly of its devastating consequences. In fact, the Holy Father has said, "We are moving toward <em>a dictatorship of relativism</em> that recognizes nothing definite and leaves only one's own ego and one's own desires as the final measure." I would simply call it an exhibition of the greatest act of denying God ever in the history of mankind.<br /><br />
Even though Catholics and, in fact, all Christians, are not called to accommodate evil but rather to expose it and struggle against it for as long as the situation requires, it is painfully clear that this is not happening.<br /><br />
We are indeed in a spiritual war of enormous proportions. This is not a war against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers.

In fact, however, its clinical trials never tested for preventing cervical cancer. The vaccine was tested for preventing pre cancerous lesions associated with two strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted disease. Since these lesions can take 12 to 20 years to develop into cervical cancer and the clinical trials lasted less than five years, medical experts warn that the jury is still out on what impact this vaccine might have on cervical cancer rates. The results of Merck's clinical trials showed the efficacy of the vaccine was "modest," even for preventing pre cancerous lesions, among a general population of young women, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. This might have been enough to kill the idea of mass inoculations with the vaccine had Merck released its final clinical trial data to peer reviewed journals in a timely fashion. Instead, it launched three ad and marketing campaigns that fostered the false impression that this vaccine had been proven to prevent cervical cancer along with a public relations blitz that stretched from California to Paris and involved payments to journalists. Only then, after the Food and Drug Administration had approved the drug, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended it for broad use, and questions grew in the press as to why this "miracle breakthrough" had not been peer reviewed, did Merck finally release its late phase trial data. Eleven and twelve year old girls, the very target of proposed mandatory vaccination by Merck, were never tested at all for efficacy in pre-licensing clinical trials. Merck simply decided that the bodies of prepubescent girls would react the same as mature women to the vaccine. The FDA was fully aware of this when they licensed the vaccine for potentially millions of prepubescent girls, requiring only that post licensing studies be done for efficacy and safety on these children after they were injected with the drug.<br /><br />

Betty Cockrum, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, is the guest speaker at the League of Women Voters’ “Lunch with the League” event.&#160; Typically the monthly event is held in the Rockne Room of the South Bend Chocolate Cafe.

The group’s image as a provider of abortions led customers to complain by phone to South Bend Chocolate Co. owner Mark Tarner, he said today.&#160; Calls came largely from women, Tarner said, including people associated with the University of Notre Dame and out-of-town customers.

And indeed, it is a crisis, though the media does not see it that way.<br /><br />
In November of last year, USA Today reported on a study released by the prestigious Pediatrics medical journal. Pointing out that sex on television could be a leading cause for the escalating rates of adolescent sexual activity, the study </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3243%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>reported</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,&#160;</strong></font></p><blockquote><font size="3"><strong>By age 16, teens who watched a lot of sexually charged TV were more than twice as likely to be pregnant or father an out-of-wedlock baby as teens who watched very little: 12% vs. 5%.

That's the norm.' " </strong></font></p><p><font size="3"><strong>The real problem with Walsh’s observation is not that a parent is or is not talking to his or her children about sex, but rather that there is an enormous amount of unsupervised time being spent by kids who watch television because it has become the national babysitter. The parents are not only not discussing matters of life and death with their children; they are not even there to participate in a healthy discussion in the first place, or to monitor what is being viewed. The last time I checked, it was parents who had the responsibility of raising children, not the sex education teacher–TV set–video game combo that seems to prevail in much of the nation these days.<br /><br />
Clearly, there are many who argue, correctly, that if these teens had been exposed to a bit of abstinence education in their high school or middle school curriculum, they might have been spared the experience of a pregnancy, or even worse, a collaborative effort to hide the problem by having the baby killed by abortion. Concerned Parents Report has published </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.concernedparents.com%252FAbstracts%252FWhat%2527s%252520Working%252FSince%25252090%2527s%252520less%252520sex.htm"><font size="3"><strong>one such document</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>. <br /><br />
But, I daresay, abstinence education these days isn’t even a band-aid for the problem our children are facing. There is much, much more at risk than simply an untimely pregnancy.<br /><br />
Just a few days ago, Pedro Jose Maria Simon Castellvi, president of the International Federation of Catholic Medical Associations, startled the world by </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnews.yahoo.com%252Fs%252Fafp%252F20090103%252Fhl_afp%252Fvaticanreligioncontraception_090103212901%2522"><font size="3"><strong>stating</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,&#160;"We have sufficient evidence to state that a non-negligible cause of male infertility in the West is the environmental pollution caused by the pill. …We are faced with a clear anti-environmental effect which demands more explanation on the part of the manufacturers."<br /><br />
Pardon me for suggesting that the world was shocked by Castellvi’s statement. Actually, the news media dismissed this report out of hand and quoted other “experts” to debunk the comment. However, this is not the first such report on the pollution caused by millions of women ingesting artificial hormones and, whether or not the national news media reports it, the body of evidence is bound to increase.<br /><br />
Further, on the same day, Castellvi had another report published in the Vatican’s official newspaper, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em>, asserting the abortifacient and carcinogenic effects of hormonal contraception. </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3179%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>He wrote</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,&#160;"The means of contraception violate at least five important rights: the right to life, the right to health, the right to education, all right to information (their spread is at the expense of information on natural resources) and the right to equality between the sexes (the burden of contraception falls mostly on women)."</strong></font></p><p><font size="3"><strong>This is potentially life-changing information about serious matters and widespread life-threatening circumstances. Yet among the many reports I have read on the subject of adolescents, contraception and pregnancy, I have never seen a warning in the mainstream media about the dangers of birth control. Thus, it too is accountable for the rising rates of adolescent pregnancy because the only facts reported are those that make contraception appealing.<br /><br />
How many teens are victims of Planned Parenthood’s birth control as the way to hide promiscuity bandwagon? Millions, I am sure, and these young people are the same young people who are getting how-to lessons on television and experiencing plenty of unsupervised time for experimentation. Now, of course, Planned Parenthood and its cronies in the "drive-by" media and elsewhere will say, “Well, they are going to do it anyway,” to which I would respond, </strong></font><font size="3"><strong>"That may or may not be true, but we should not accept that argument. Our responsibility is to combat it by affirming a teen’s self-respect, and teaching each of them the true meaning of love and the lasting rewards of saving sex for marriage.

In the lyrics for the song “</strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3246%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>,” we read these words:&#160;</strong></font></p><blockquote><font size="3"><strong>Hoping to find a friend and a lover,<br />
I'll bless the day I discover<br />
another heart, looking for love!</strong></font></blockquote><p><font size="3"><strong>This song misses the very point that must be made, as do the messages far too many of our young people are getting from their parents, the television and so many other sources one can hardly count them.<br /><br />
Love is much more than finding another person to whom you can give your body; it is a gift that must be nurtured, must grow and should be the foundation for a marriage that will last a lifetime, not a brief fling. But if parents do not accept their proper role first, then we'll continue to read headlines on teen behavior such as today's, until the story itself is no longer newsworthy.<br /><br />
Pope John Paul II made the obligation of parents very clear in his May 2004 message "</strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D656%2526L%253D3241%2526F%253DH"><font size="3"><strong>The Media and the Family: A Risk and a Richness</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>":&#160;</strong></font></p><blockquote><font size="3"><strong>Parents, as the primary and most important educators of their children, are also the first to teach them about the media. They are called to train their offspring in the “moderate, critical, watchful and prudent use of the media” in the home (Familiaris Consortio, 76). When parents do that consistently and well, family life is greatly enriched. Even very young children can be taught important lessons about the media: that they are produced by people anxious to communicate messages; that these are often messages to do something - to buy a product, to engage in dubious behaviour - that is not in the child’s best interests or in accord with moral truth; that children should not uncritically accept or imitate what they find in the media.<br /><br />
Parents also need to regulate the use of media in the home. This would include planning and scheduling media use, strictly limiting the time children devote to media, making entertainment a family experience, putting some media entirely off limits and periodically excluding all of them for the sake of other family activities. Above all, parents should give good example to children by their own thoughtful and selective use of media. Often they will find it helpful to join with other families to study and discuss the problems and opportunities presented by the use of the media. Families should be outspoken in telling producers, advertisers, and public authorities what they like and dislike.<br /><br /></strong></font></blockquote><p><font size="3"><strong>The parental love described by the Holy Father, which requires self-sacrifice and commitment, achieves much more than merely ensuring that children view only appropriate media.

Our new president has a golden opportunity to set the record straight about his views on a wide variety of things, including abortion, sex education and euthanasia. To my mind, these are fundamental matters that shape how a man is going to examine any challenge that comes his way. <br /><br />

*For a renewal of the virtues of purity and self-control, especially among our youth.<br /><br />
*In reparation for the scourges of abortion, embryonic stem cell research, euthanasia, cloning, artificial contraception and all manifestations of the culture of death, and especially in reparation for the support and/or complacency that we as American Catholics have shown toward these evils.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The thing that makes this novena so profoundly important during this particular time in America's history is that it puts the entire question of what could happen over the coming four years in the proper perspective.<br /><br />
Here are some examples of what I mean.<br /><br />
First and foremost, we pro-life Americans have a golden opportunity right now to work as never before to bring about a true culture of life in the United States. Pope John Paul II made this term immensely popular in his encyclical </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D1434%2526F%253DH"><em><strong><font size="3">The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae)</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3">. He used it carefully to express the distinct differences between those who embrace death and those who embrace life. Among his many statements, this one from section 50 seems to sum up the challenge/opportunity we currently have before us:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">In the early afternoon of Good Friday, "there was darkness over the whole land ... while the sun's light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two" (Lk 23:44, 45). This is the symbol of a great cosmic disturbance and a massive conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil, between life and death. Today we too find ourselves in the midst of a dramatic conflict between the "culture of death ever more radiantly and brightly, and is revealed as the centre, meaning and goal of all history and of every human life." and the "culture of life." But the glory of the Cross is not overcome by this darkness; rather, it shines ever more radiantly and brightly."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Praying that President Obama, as well as all politicians, will be led to encounter Christ and His truth – in every aspect of their personal and public lives – is a glorious intention that should be on each of our hearts, not only as we move from Inauguration Day to the March for Life memorial observance, but every day. Obviously, we cannot sit down with the president as individuals and pray with him, but each of us can and should pray for him, asking God to reveal the truth of what abortion really is and is not. <br />
In that regard, I was inspired to read these words from </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3346%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">Bishop Robert Vasa</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, written just this week:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Regardless of how many years have passed since the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court Decision and regardless of how prevalent and routine abortion has become in this country, the simple truth remains, it is an act of extreme violence to the pre-born child and to the distressed mother. Thus, if anyone says, "I love God" and still favors abortion, he is, to quote St. John, a liar. May we all live out faithfully what it means to love God.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Yes, we must each pray very specifically for our fellow Americans, including our new president, but it is also incumbent upon us to do more than that. We must act on our faith in a way that resonates with those who have grown accustomed to abortion, are comfortable with relegating it to the category of politics or have never really thought about it at all! After 36 years of decriminalized murder, which is what abortion truly and clearly is, far too many in our midst are in denial. The stream of consciousness that relegates abortion to being merely an "issue," starts with our new president, who said during the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.rochester.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fnvs.all.org%252Fsendstudio%252Flink.php%253FM%253D96913%2526N%253D674%2526L%253D3340%2526F%253DH"><strong><font size="3">presidential debates</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">This is an issue that – look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to – to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, "We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby." Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obama's personal view exposes the problem with America's perspective in a way that makes the novena’s third petition even more urgent. Each of us is tempted to say, "There is nothing I can do to change the way other people think about abortion." However, that is wrong.<br /><br />
Read Obama's words carefully. In an effort to deny the fact that abortion ends the life of an innocent human being, he seeks, in his own words "common ground." He wants the culture of life to sit down with the culture of death and find a space somewhere between them where agreement can be reached. He wants good and evil, Christ and Satan, to be buddies. <br /><br />
You think I am oversimplifying? Well, I am not. In Obama's words is the kernel of what it is that has caused such confusion in the body politic. The idea that abortion is an “issue” obfuscates what it does, who dies, and why it is always and in every case wrong. <br /><br />
Obama said, "Nobody is pro-abortion." If nobody is actually pro-abortion, then why did the man promise Planned Parenthood he would sign the Freedom of Choice Act into law? Why does he constantly advocate for "choice"? The truth is, Obama's rhetoric reflects the state of our thinking in America, and pro-lifers have to change that – one person at a time, one heart at a time, one mind at a time. And with the Lord's help, we can do that.<br /><br />
We can do that for our young people, our elected officials, our fallen-away Catholic brethren and for each other. And while we are praying, we are also obliged to reach out to them with the truth of God's mercy, His love and His fatherly concern.<br /><br />
The novena’s final intention addresses the biggest challenge we each have to face, every day of our lives. Making reparation for the sins that have desecrated God's gift of life, destroyed hope for so many and devastated their inherent ability to change and grow in Christ can be humbling concept. As we pray, asking God to forgive this nation and each of us, individually, for the tragedies that have befallen our children, we are spiritually making reparation for those who have yet to discern that they are debilitated by their personal choices.<br /><br />
The next four years are going to give us remarkable opportunities for growing this pro-life movement, strengthening it from within and expanding our efforts to convert the “mushy middle.” I believe we must include the president in that group as well. I do not believe Obama is an evil man; I do believe he is a man capable of change, capable of recognizing real hope in the cross of Christ and capable of acknowledging the fullness of truth.<br /><br />
May our prayers, our efforts and our desire for profound and positive change be that infusion of hope that this nation needs at this hour.</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;<strong><font size="5">American Life League Info.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Volume 6, Number 11&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; March 16, 2009</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">Prayer Requests<br />

"School District #3" continued, An Analysis of Planned Parenthood’s Family Life Education Program <br />
From <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In School District #3, Planned Parenthood had funded the installation of a Family Life Education program.&#160; Amid protests from parents, including objections to the fact that the program would teach the children values contrary to their religious up-bringing, educators pointed to the high – and rising – teen pregnancy rates and stated that the good of the entire community had to come before the beliefs of any particular students.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Several years after the program had begun, a parent with a child in fourth grade became outraged over the program and the messages it was giving to the young people of the community.&#160; The concerned parent decided to get things started in the school district by holding an informational meeting.&#160; As the speakers read from the actual course material, attendees were surprised to find a number of things being taught.&#160; All were clearly opposed to the sex ed program and one school board member stated he was “shocked” by the nature and extent of the program.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The two school board members who attended the meeting were very upset at the Planned Parenthood program.&#160; They asked the Superintendent of Schools to follow-up.&#160; The Superintendent scheduled a meeting to discuss the matter with the concerned parents.&#160; In preparation for the meeting, parents prepared an analysis of the FLE program in the school.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Some of the controversial elements the parents found in the program included:&#160; sessions in “values clarification;” presentations of the acceptability of contraceptive sex; a strict rule that “there are no right or wrong answers;” and some language that was racially disturbing to the black community.&#160; In addition, parents were upset because, although the program was supposed to be voluntary, no alternative classes of instruction were provided for students whose parents opted to keep them out of the class.&#160; In addition, it was felt that the “negative permission form,” where parents who did not object to the class were assumed to have given permission, was an incorrect measure and that specific approval should be obtained.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">At the time of this analysis the program had been taught each of the past seven years.&#160; The older students who entered the program during the first year had now grown to age 21.&#160; Thus, when figures were published on the teenage pregnancy rates in the area, the teenagers involved had been through the FLE program.&#160; If the promises of the program were correct, the parents should have seen a significant reduction in teenage pregnancy over those years.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">What actually happened?&#160; The statistics published by the state health department revealed that pregnancy rates among teenagers had INCREASED during the time the program had been in place!&#160; In fact, the pregnancy rate among 15- to 19-year-olds had increased over seven percent and the pregnancy rate among 10- to 14-year-olds had increased over five percent.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Despite the promises, despite the putting aside of traditional community values in favor of the “common good” and despite the fact that parents’ objections were labeled as trivial, the FLE program was a FAILURE!!&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Is this surprising?&#160; No!&#160; In fact, these types of programs have failed throughout the United States.&#160; Wherever they have been tried, the results are always the same.&#160; They do nothing to reduce teenage pregnancy and, in most cases, teenage pregnancy increases.&#160; There are many reasons for this failure, but, basically, the programs are flawed in their conception.&#160; Family Life programs, particularly their persistence in promoting the idea that nothing is “right or wrong” only contribute to the problem of teenage pregnancy.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">At the meeting with the Superintendent in September, the parents handed out the prepared statement citing the fact the FLE programs in general are ineffective and that there were no studies to prove that they worked to reduce teen pregnancy.&#160; The FLE Director objected to this and cited a study which showed that FLE programs result in a decreased fertility rate amongst teens.&#160; The parents explained to the FLE Director that she was correct, but that “fertility rate” means birth rate, not pregnancy rate and, in fact, the study she quoted showed that there were more teen pregnancies but less teen births because the program was apparently also good in convincing the children to have abortions!&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The parents then turned their attention to the specific program in the school district and told the superintendent that one of the objections to the program was that it encouraged teens to use contraceptives.&#160; The FLE Director responded quite vocally to this claim as well.&#160; The parents handed the course curriculum guide, published by the school, to the superintendent and asked him to read it for himself.&#160; When the superintendent realized that the parents were actually reading from the school’s own documents and that the FLE Director was giving him wrong information, the tone of the meeting changed.&#160; (NOTE:&#160; The lying of those people involved with FLE programs is not uncommon.)</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">A junior from the high school who was also present at the meeting told the superintendent that he had taken the courses in question and that the general attitude he received from the course is that it is perfectly OK to have pre-marital sex, just don’t get pregnant!&#160; He stated that most of the kids he knew got the same message from the course.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The meeting ran for almost two hours before the superintendent had to leave.&#160; He did, however, arrange for a follow-up meeting and did commit to the parents that changes would be made in the program including the removal of contraceptive-pushing class sessions.&#160; He stated that the program would be reoriented to put much more emphasis on chastity and “saying no.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial;

Then I will offer you generous sacrifice and praise your gracious name, LORD, because it has rescued me from every trouble, and my eyes look down on my foes.&#160; Psalms 54:3-9</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px">&#160;</p><hr /><p><font face="Tahoma"><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-style: italic">On The Edge&#160;</span>is a fast-paced, roundtable discussion among the new generation of pro-life experts who work every day in the trenches of the movement, focus&#160;on current events, news, politics&#160;and dozens of American Life League programs.&#160; </font></strong></font></p><div><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><font size="3" face="Tahoma"><strong>Each show features a rapid-fire rant from <em>ALL Report</em>'<em>s </em>Michael Hichborn called "On the Soapbox," as well as plain English explanations and commentary on issues facing&#160;Americans as they confront the civil rights movement's last campaign: the establishment of personhood for the preborn.</strong></font></div><div><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><font face="Tahoma"><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-style: italic">On The Edge</span> is brought to you by American Life League's generous supporters, without whom&#160;this show would not be possible.
