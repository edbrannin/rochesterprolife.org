The study released today shows that the teen pregnancy rate among American teens rose three percent in 2006, teen birth rates rose four percent, and abortion rates were up one percent.<br /><br />
While Planned Parenthood rushes to paint the devastating statistics as an indictment against the Bush administration’s abstinence policy, the timeline points to a different culprit: Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />
“This is not rocket science,” said Jim Sedlak, vice president of American Life League. “When you don’t tell kids to remain abstinent, they have more sex and more of them get pregnant. Pregnancy rates go down when kids don’t have sex.”</font></strong></p><blockquote><strong><font size="4">- Prior to 1990, teen pregnancy rates were increasing just about every year as Planned Parenthood’s sex-ed programs dominated public and even private school sex-education courses.<br /><br />
- In the early 1990s, it became popular to teach the abstinence message to teens and preteens. Teen pregnancy rates began to fall.<br /><br />
- By 1995, the federal government was funding an abstinence-only message while pregnancy rates continued to fall.<br /><br />
- By 2000, Planned Parenthood began lobbying the various states to refuse abstinence money and reduce abstinence programs and, predictably, in 2006, the teen pregnancy rate increased for the first time in 15 years.<br /><br />
- Today, partnering with President Obama, Planned Parenthood lobbying has succeeded in virtually cutting off abstinence-only funds.</font></strong></blockquote><p><strong><font size="4">"We can only imagine how high the teen pregnancy rates will go," Sedlak said. “Planned Parenthood’s reach extends far beyond their vice grip on the nation’s classrooms. Their work can also be felt in pop culture, the internet, advertising and television – all excellent vehicles in their long-term goal to sexualize our children. Sadly it’s working.”<br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">FOR MORE INFORMATION:<br /><br />

From <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">STOPP has often painted Planned Parenthood as a very patient organization and has emphasized that parents have to be especially diligent when fighting its programs. A group of parents in School District #6 fought a Planned Parenthood inspired sex ed program proposal which is a prime example of both this patience on Planned Parenthood’s part and the diligence of the parents.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">In this instance, it took five years from the initial concept of introducing a Family Life Education program in the schools to goal setting and the plan to actually implement the program was scheduled to take another three years. The planning had been going on for two years before the Advisory Board was formed (usually handpicked people who support the philosophies of Planned Parenthood) and before the first school board vote on the issue (which is the time, in many communities, that parents first realize what is going on). This is typical and requires that citizens opposed to the program organize early for a long fight!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Parents in this school district were very involved in community activities and became involved in the Advisory Board early in the process. However, they were repeatedly told by FLE pushers that “nothing was happening.” Yet, they found an entire set of goals presented to the school board and even found themselves in a position of having to fight a program that had been slipped through in the name of the “committee” of which they were a part!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">To begin this fight, parents collected a great deal of information on FLE programs and spent time going through the teacher’s reference section of the school library (they found many objectionable texts).&#160; Then the parents held an informational meeting.&#160; It was pointed out, as we have learned previously, that while FLE programs are invariably put in place to “reduce teenage pregnancy,” they consistently result in an INCREASE of teen pregnancies. Sex ed pushers do not have a single scientific report which demonstrates that their programs work. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Parents were warned that there is no good sex ed program because there is no way to control what the teacher does in the classroom. Even the best curriculum and texts can be negated by a teacher that believes the Planned Parenthood line. And, since Planned Parenthood spends much time and money educating teachers and health departments, there is no effective way of knowing exactly what all the teachers will actually teach.&#160; Sex ed is the responsibility of the parents and must be left that way.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">With letters to the editor and groups showing up at every school board meeting, these parents forced the school board to reconsider its initial approval of the program objectives. The board finally had to recognize the strength of the parents’ position and voted to rescind their approval of the FLE program!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">But, FLE pushers did not give up. They convinced the school board to conduct a survey of the entire community to see if sex education was wanted in the schools. The FLE supporters began holding closed sessions and even decided to change the FLE vocabulary, calling FLE programs “Human Development” subject matter. Local parents immediately challenged the legality of the closed sessions – even to the point of appealing to the state committee on open government which sided with the parents.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">While the debate over the survey was going on, Planned Parenthood started to push another program on the school district – “peer counseling,” which would have children counseling other children. The parents wasted no time in mounting a fight against this program and after they had, again, raised the community consciousness, school district officials decided to postpone any action on the program “indefinitely.” Although many parents had hoped to see the program rejected outright, the action of the board effectively killed the program.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The lessons that we should learn from the activities in School District #6 are:</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">1.&#160;Planned Parenthood is a very patient organization. In this case, they laid out a seven-year plan to get Family Life Education into the school district. This is not unusual.&#160; When fighting Planned Parenthood, we must understand it is a long-term fight and we must be willing to stay the course.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">2.&#160;Part of the “modus operandi” of these programs is to pretend to get community involvement and to tie parents up in committee meetings while the program pushers work to get their programs adopted.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">3.&#160;When trying to find out what is going on in your school district, one good source is the teacher’s reference section of the school library. These are the books intended for teacher use in preparing lessons and most of the hard core texts can be found here.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">4.&#160;The community survey is an often-used ploy. Most people understand that you can make a survey say anything you want by how you phrase the questions. These people get professionals with strong credentials to use the survey to achieve the preconceived results.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">5.&#160;Planned Parenthood is a mast at name games. It used to refer to its programs as sex education. When that didn’t work, it changed the name to Family Life Education. Now that parents are beginning to catch on to this terminology, program titles are being changed to Human Growth and Development or something similar. The programs haven’t changed, just the names have changed to protect the guilty and fool the public.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Next month – School District #7</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="5">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>When is a “fetus” a baby?

Wade</em>.</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="93"><strong><font size="4">I am well aware of the opinions of the “leading pro-life attorneys” who are giving these bishops bad advice. I have found their arguments flawed on several levels.

This is neither a political nor a legal question. It's a question of whether one accepts or rejects the fundamental principle&#160;that human beings all deserve to be equally recognized&#160;as human persons endowed with&#160;human rights.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="95"><strong><font size="4">For nearly 40 years, the American legal system has been morally imprisoned by a set of U.S. Supreme Court decisions (<em>Roe v. Wade </em>and <em>Doe v. Bolton</em>) that deny the humanity of the child prior to birth by setting aside all scientific evidence, not to mention common sense. The inanity of these decisions is clear, but apparently to some, how to go about undoing the damage they have done is not. <br /><br />
This is where the human personhood movement comes in, and it’s about time Catholic bishops thought about this from a perspective not clouded by the politics of false prudence, legal positivism or incrementalism. Too many dead bodies lie on that road; it’s time to change course!<br /><br />
There is no reliance within the human personhood movement on unpredictable courts, Your Excellencies. There is a firm, undeniable reliance on exact scientific evidence, which leads to the philosophical conclusion that a human being, from his or her beginning, is a human person. This is proven beyond doubt by studying the facts, not by fearing or misrepresenting court decisions. As a matter of fact, the human personhood movement does not address <em>Roe v. Wade </em>or <em>Doe v. Bolton</em>, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />
Pro-life Americans, including Roman Catholic bishops and their associates in the various state Catholic conferences, have to move beyond the politics and understand that <em>Roe</em> and <em>Doe</em> are symptomatic of a culture that long ago set out on the path of dehumanizing vulnerable persons. <em>Roe</em> and <em>Doe</em> were the result of a permissive attitude toward denying the personhood of human beings deemed “inconvenient” or “undesirable.” <br /><br />
If we honestly examine the Supreme Court’s infamous <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3827&amp;F=H">Dred Scott</a> </em>decision,&#160;we learn a valuable lesson. The Supreme Court never recanted or overturned the prejudice on display in that decision. Citizens took it upon themselves to correct the injustices being perpetrated throughout society and by government against members of the human race. The result was a movement to renew the culture and restore justice by way of a constitutional amendment. <br /><br />
Similarly, it is not the human personhood movement’s goal to overturn <em>Roe</em> and <em>Doe</em>. Our goal is to restore recognition of personhood to all human beings. We do not need the court’s permission to do that.<br /><br />
It occurs to me that this fact flies in the face of all that the so-called leading pro-life attorneys have been saying&#160;to Catholic bishops nationwide.&#160;First and foremost, there is no human being who exists because of the Supreme Court, Congress or any other body of individuals. Each exists by the grace of God, His creative power and His endowment of personhood at the instant a human being is created. There is no doubt about this, particularly if one is a person of deep religious faith, as is each Catholic bishop.<br /><br />
Further, the human personhood movement relies heavily on a two-pronged educational strategy. We share the science and then we share the reasoning behind the movement. This is why we can state unhesitatingly that not only is legal recognition of human personhood the right goal for pro-life Americans, it is only logical way for society to once again acknowledge the truth of who the human being is and why each is so precious.<br /><br />
We encourage the Catholic bishops of Montana and elsewhere to set aside the disingenuous argument that the passage of a personhood amendment to a state constitution "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3829&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">might trigger an appellate process that could strengthen <em>Roe v. Wade</em></font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">.”&#160;There is absolutely no way that anyone knows whether or not such a trigger would be pulled, but we all know that maintaining the status quo is unthinkable. <br /><br />
We cannot be satisfied, as servants of life and, more importantly, servants of God, with the “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3832&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">common sense" restrictions</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;on abortion that seem to be the standard fare offered by many, including those leading pro-life attorneys relied upon by Montana’s bishops. It has never been the pro-life movement’s goal to&#160;restrict the killing so that it happens less.&#160;If one knows that the act of abortion is murder, then how could we ever defend the argument that restricting acts of murder so that fewer people are murdered is a worthy goal? What sort of twisted idea is that?<br /><br />
Also contained in the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3829&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Montana Catholic Conference</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> statement is the following strategic recommendation:&#160;</font></strong></p><blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="96"><strong><font size="4">The key to advancing the culture of life in Montana is addressing the privacy provision in our state constitution which provides a right to abortion. Therefore, we are working with constitutional experts to develop an amendment which would exclude abortion from the privacy provision in the state constitution. <br /><br />
Passing such a constitutional amendment would open the way to addressing real change in the state. We could then pass laws to enact restrictions such as requiring short waiting periods before an abortion can be performed and requiring parental notification in cases when the person seeking an abortion is under age. These restrictions have been noted in a recent study as being effective in reducing abortion. Passage of such laws would save numerous lives on the way to changing hearts and minds as we work to achieve our ultimate goal of overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="97"><strong><font size="4">This statement confirms my worst suspicions. Let me be perfectly clear.<br /><br />
There is no legitimate right to privacy in matters of life and death. No one can in good conscience argue that a “right to privacy” permits murder. Further there is no right to abortion, as Pope John Paul II reminded us in <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=317&amp;F=H">Evangelium Vitae</a> </em>(#20) when he taught what the consequences of such an argument&#160;are:&#160;</font></strong></p><blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="98"><strong><font size="4">To claim the right to abortion, infanticide and euthanasia, and to recognize that right in law, means to attribute to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: that of an absolute power over others and against others. This is the death of true freedom: “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin” (Jn 8:34).</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="99"><strong><font size="4">There is no doubt that the type of amendment that the Montana Catholic Conference is proposing would lead to a recognition of aborting a human being as a legitimate practice as long as such a practice was restricted in some way. The&#160;skewed thinking behind such a proposal is too inconceivable to even contemplate. <br /><br />
It is my fervent hope and prayer that Most Rev. George Leo Thomas, bishop of the Diocese of Helena, and Most Rev. Michael W. Warfel, bishop of the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings, will reexamine why they would endorse a flawed policy and oppose human personhood efforts in their state. <br /><br />
The unity of purpose that once made the pro-life movement in America so great was that we understood that unless and until every innocent human being was equally protected under the law and in the culture, there would be no end to the senseless murder of the innocent. That unity of purpose appears to have died, and we strive to revive that as well.<br /><br />
We are praying that our Catholic bishops will lead the way toward this lost unity of purpose, for as Saint Thomas Aquinas explained,&#160; “[H]uman law is law inasmuch as it is in conformity with right reason and thus derives from the eternal law. But when a law is contrary to reason, it is called an unjust law; but in this case it ceases to be a law and becomes instead an act of violence” (</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3824&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Evangelium Vitae</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> #72). <br /><br />

Why do we insist on using the word “person” in our fight against the attacks on human dignity? Why not define when life begins or what a human being is? To understand this, we must first understand&#160;the meaning of the word “person.” The word “person” has different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="97"><strong><font size="4">In a theological context, the word “person” refers to the union of the physical and the spiritual, in other words,&#160;body and&#160;soul. In <em>Evangelium Vitae</em>, Pope John Paul II asks the rhetorical question, how could a human individual not be a human person? In other words, the Catholic teaching that a human individual is also a human person is a self-evident truth.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="98"><strong><font size="4">Within the context of an atheistic philosophy, the term “person” is defined by a set of utilitarian qualities: Is the human being self-aware? Does he or she have the capacity to reason? Can he or she live independently and develop relationships? All of these are the complete opposite of what our faith teaches. Human dignity comes not from our differing abilities and qualities, but from God Himself, Who is the Author/Creator of every human individual’s life.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="99"><strong><font size="4">In a legal context, a proper definition of the word “person” is of extreme importance.The United States Constitution uses the word “person” 49 times. On the other hand, it never uses the word “human being” or “human life” or even just “human.” The reason is quite simple: The Constitution is primarily concerned with rights, and the term&#160;for&#160;one who is recognized by law as having rights and duties is “person.”</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="100"><strong><font size="4">In the case of <em>Colorado v. <a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=531&amp;L=3799&amp;F=H">Lage</a> </em>(2009), a man who crashed his car head-on into a car driven by an eight-and-a-half months expectant mother, was able to avoid being charged with killing the child in the womb because the court felt “compelled by the legislature’s definition of a 'person,'” which only considered a human being to be a “person” after birth.

But more eloquent than all of the rational and legal arguments that I can offer are the deeply insightful and inspired words of our beloved John Paul the Great. This great defender of life wrote, “[W]hen freedom is detached from objective truth it becomes impossible to establish personal rights on a firm rational basis; and the ground is laid for society to be at the mercy of the unrestrained will of individuals or the oppressive totalitarianism of public authority” (<em>EV</em>, # 96).</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="104"><strong><font size="4">These words answer all the arguments against personhood.

In other words, focus on education; focus on the principle.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="106"><strong><font size="4">The Personhood Amendment first and foremost aims at a cultural transformation that will form consciences “with regard to the incomparable and inviolable worth of every human life” (<em>EV</em>, #96).

Each person is unique and distinctly different from the next person.</font></strong></p><p jquery1259849178330="76"><strong><font size="4">The book of Jeremiah tells us that before we were created, God knew us.

This principle is stated in the Constitution of the United States; it is as basic as the very fact of our existence. The founders of our country wrote in the Declaration of Independence that we Americans consider this truth self-evident: all people are “endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.” In other words, human rights come from God and this is obvious to everyone. Among these rights, they said, is the right to life.</font></strong></p><p jquery1259849178330="78"><strong><font size="4">I would find it impossible to be deeply involved in the pro-life movement if I didn’t have religious convictions about when human life begins.

The term “a human being’s life” is more accurate.<br />
&#160;<br />
Although "conception" is commonly used by the general public, it is expressly and universally rejected as a scientific term by embryologists, scientists and medical professionals, and thus does not adequately support the concept of personhood.&#160;In addition, the term is not always understood to refer to the act of fertilization, the sexual reproductive process which is initiated upon first contact of the human sperm and human oocyte, and is often erroneously taken to mean “implantation,” the process by which a preborn child up to two weeks old attaches to the mother’s uterine wall.<br />
&#160;<br />
&#160;In many states, as well as in literally dozens of national and international medical and research organizations (including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), the term "conception" is now erroneously defined as "beginning at implantation."

As personhood advocates, it is critically important that we use the correct terminology to describe preborn babies, their mothers, the very act of abortion and even the facilities in which abortions are committed. It doesn’t matter if you are a full time pro-life advocate or a “normal” person who works, goes to school, takes care of your family, etc. We must all watch what we say in daily life—even in casual conversation.<br /><br />
So, the words we use are very powerful and can make the difference between life and death. You might be surprised to realize that even we pro-lifers often use terms and phrases that can be dehumanizing to the very people we are trying to save. That can cause confusion and can hamper our efforts to obtain recognition of the human rights of all human persons. As we educate the public and advocate for the rights of all human persons, born and preborn, we must seriously examine the language we use and make some changes, if necessary.<br /><br />
With that in mind, I am going to share with you this short list of terms and phrases that we should drop from our pro-life vocabulary:</font></strong></p><blockquote><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="96" jquery1258503224200="96"><strong><font size="4">1.&#160;Fetus, embryo—These terms are generally used by abortion supporters, but I also notice pro-lifers using these terms often. Fetus and embryo are actually terms referring to stages of development. Their use begs the question, which animal species, during its embryonic or fetal development, are you referring to? For human beings, embryo describes human development from the very beginning of a human being’s life through their eighth week of development. Fetus describes a human being’s biological development from the beginning of their ninth week of development until birth. We should replace these terms with “human embryo,” “human fetus” or “human being during their embryonic (or fetal) development.”</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="97" jquery1258503224200="97"><strong><font size="4">2.&#160;Fertilized egg—This is a dehumanizing term used as a form of pro-abortion propaganda. It is not a legitimate term, since it isn’t scientifically accurate. Women don’t carry eggs; they have oocytes. Upon first contact of a human sperm and a human oocyte, a newly created human person now exists who is in his/her first embryonic stage of development. This term has become popular with abortion advocates these days, in response to the state personhood initiatives cropping up around the country. We need to correct this whenever we see or hear it. Use correct terminology in its place, such as “human embryo.”</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="98" jquery1258503224200="98"><strong><font size="4">3.&#160;Mistake, accident, unwanted, unplanned— These terms have very negative connotations and are very demeaning, especially for the child who happens to overhear some mention of the circumstances in which he or she came into being. Every child is wanted by someone and no one is an accident. God creates every single person with a special purpose in life. A positive-sounding term such as “surprise” should be used instead of terms or phrases that imply that God’s creation of a baby is an unfortunate event.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="99" jquery1258503224200="99"><strong><font size="4">4.&#160;Pro-choice—This term was developed by a marketing firm employed by the abortion lobby before abortion became decriminalized on January 22, 1973. It has been and still is a very effective term, but is very misleading. It begs the question, what is the choice? The child has no choice when threatened with an abortionist’s suction device, knives and forceps. Replace this term with “pro-abortion” or “abortion advocate.”<br /><br />
5.&#160;Pregnant woman—This term takes the child out of the equation and can make pregnancy sound like a disease. Abortion is often referred to as “terminating a pregnancy.” Instead, use terms such as “mother,” “pregnant mom” or “expectant mother.” <br /><br />
6.&#160;Health clinic/abortion clinic—“Health” gives the impression that health is being restored to an individual. Similarly, “clinic” normally denotes a respectable, morally legitimate health care facility. Abortion is murder, not health care, so we should not dignify it with such terms. Replace such terms with “abortion business,” “abortion mill,” “abortion facility,” “abortion center” and so forth. <br /><br />
7.&#160;The abortion issue—Taxes are an issue. Paying for education is an issue. Abortion is not an issue; it’s a tragedy. Abortion is a violent crime that kills a human person and leaves his/her mother scarred for life. You can also replace issue with terms such as “question,” “matter,” etc. <br /><br />
8.&#160;It—A baby boy or baby girl is not an it. Yet that is how many of us refer to children in utero or even at the moment of their birth. I hear this so often: “It’s a (boy/girl)!” Instead, say, “He is a boy” or “She is a girl” or “My/our/their/his/her/the baby is a (boy/girl).” <br /><br />
9.&#160;I’m going to be a ___!—This phrase usually ends with “mother,” “father,” “grandparent,” “aunt,” “uncle,” etc., But it’s inaccurate and dehumanizes the baby, because actually, it’s a done deal! The person speaking is already a mother (or father, grandparent, etc.). If you catch someone (or yourself) saying this, quickly correct it by reminding them (or yourself) that the child already exists, so they (or you) are already a mother (or father, grandparent, etc.).</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="100" jquery1258503224200="100"><strong><font size="4">This is in no way an exhaustive list.

The study released today shows that the teen pregnancy rate among American teens rose three percent in 2006, teen birth rates rose four percent, and abortion rates were up one percent.<br /><br />
While Planned Parenthood rushes to paint the devastating statistics as an indictment against the Bush administration’s abstinence policy, the timeline points to a different culprit: Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />
“This is not rocket science,” said Jim Sedlak, vice president of American Life League. “When you don’t tell kids to remain abstinent, they have more sex and more of them get pregnant. Pregnancy rates go down when kids don’t have sex.”</font></strong></p><blockquote><strong><font size="4">- Prior to 1990, teen pregnancy rates were increasing just about every year as Planned Parenthood’s sex-ed programs dominated public and even private school sex-education courses.<br /><br />
- In the early 1990s, it became popular to teach the abstinence message to teens and preteens. Teen pregnancy rates began to fall.<br /><br />
- By 1995, the federal government was funding an abstinence-only message while pregnancy rates continued to fall.<br /><br />
- By 2000, Planned Parenthood began lobbying the various states to refuse abstinence money and reduce abstinence programs and, predictably, in 2006, the teen pregnancy rate increased for the first time in 15 years.<br /><br />
- Today, partnering with President Obama, Planned Parenthood lobbying has succeeded in virtually cutting off abstinence-only funds.</font></strong></blockquote><p><strong><font size="4">"We can only imagine how high the teen pregnancy rates will go," Sedlak said. “Planned Parenthood’s reach extends far beyond their vice grip on the nation’s classrooms. Their work can also be felt in pop culture, the internet, advertising and television – all excellent vehicles in their long-term goal to sexualize our children. Sadly it’s working.”<br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">FOR MORE INFORMATION:<br /><br />

From <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">STOPP has often painted Planned Parenthood as a very patient organization and has emphasized that parents have to be especially diligent when fighting its programs. A group of parents in School District #6 fought a Planned Parenthood inspired sex ed program proposal which is a prime example of both this patience on Planned Parenthood’s part and the diligence of the parents.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">In this instance, it took five years from the initial concept of introducing a Family Life Education program in the schools to goal setting and the plan to actually implement the program was scheduled to take another three years. The planning had been going on for two years before the Advisory Board was formed (usually handpicked people who support the philosophies of Planned Parenthood) and before the first school board vote on the issue (which is the time, in many communities, that parents first realize what is going on). This is typical and requires that citizens opposed to the program organize early for a long fight!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Parents in this school district were very involved in community activities and became involved in the Advisory Board early in the process. However, they were repeatedly told by FLE pushers that “nothing was happening.” Yet, they found an entire set of goals presented to the school board and even found themselves in a position of having to fight a program that had been slipped through in the name of the “committee” of which they were a part!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">To begin this fight, parents collected a great deal of information on FLE programs and spent time going through the teacher’s reference section of the school library (they found many objectionable texts).&#160; Then the parents held an informational meeting.&#160; It was pointed out, as we have learned previously, that while FLE programs are invariably put in place to “reduce teenage pregnancy,” they consistently result in an INCREASE of teen pregnancies. Sex ed pushers do not have a single scientific report which demonstrates that their programs work. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Parents were warned that there is no good sex ed program because there is no way to control what the teacher does in the classroom. Even the best curriculum and texts can be negated by a teacher that believes the Planned Parenthood line. And, since Planned Parenthood spends much time and money educating teachers and health departments, there is no effective way of knowing exactly what all the teachers will actually teach.&#160; Sex ed is the responsibility of the parents and must be left that way.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">With letters to the editor and groups showing up at every school board meeting, these parents forced the school board to reconsider its initial approval of the program objectives. The board finally had to recognize the strength of the parents’ position and voted to rescind their approval of the FLE program!</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">But, FLE pushers did not give up. They convinced the school board to conduct a survey of the entire community to see if sex education was wanted in the schools. The FLE supporters began holding closed sessions and even decided to change the FLE vocabulary, calling FLE programs “Human Development” subject matter. Local parents immediately challenged the legality of the closed sessions – even to the point of appealing to the state committee on open government which sided with the parents.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">While the debate over the survey was going on, Planned Parenthood started to push another program on the school district – “peer counseling,” which would have children counseling other children. The parents wasted no time in mounting a fight against this program and after they had, again, raised the community consciousness, school district officials decided to postpone any action on the program “indefinitely.” Although many parents had hoped to see the program rejected outright, the action of the board effectively killed the program.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The lessons that we should learn from the activities in School District #6 are:</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">1.&#160;Planned Parenthood is a very patient organization. In this case, they laid out a seven-year plan to get Family Life Education into the school district. This is not unusual.&#160; When fighting Planned Parenthood, we must understand it is a long-term fight and we must be willing to stay the course.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">2.&#160;Part of the “modus operandi” of these programs is to pretend to get community involvement and to tie parents up in committee meetings while the program pushers work to get their programs adopted.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">3.&#160;When trying to find out what is going on in your school district, one good source is the teacher’s reference section of the school library. These are the books intended for teacher use in preparing lessons and most of the hard core texts can be found here.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">4.&#160;The community survey is an often-used ploy. Most people understand that you can make a survey say anything you want by how you phrase the questions. These people get professionals with strong credentials to use the survey to achieve the preconceived results.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">5.&#160;Planned Parenthood is a mast at name games. It used to refer to its programs as sex education. When that didn’t work, it changed the name to Family Life Education. Now that parents are beginning to catch on to this terminology, program titles are being changed to Human Growth and Development or something similar. The programs haven’t changed, just the names have changed to protect the guilty and fool the public.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Next month – School District #7</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="5">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>When is a “fetus” a baby?

Wade</em>.</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="93"><strong><font size="4">I am well aware of the opinions of the “leading pro-life attorneys” who are giving these bishops bad advice. I have found their arguments flawed on several levels.

This is neither a political nor a legal question. It's a question of whether one accepts or rejects the fundamental principle&#160;that human beings all deserve to be equally recognized&#160;as human persons endowed with&#160;human rights.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="95"><strong><font size="4">For nearly 40 years, the American legal system has been morally imprisoned by a set of U.S. Supreme Court decisions (<em>Roe v. Wade </em>and <em>Doe v. Bolton</em>) that deny the humanity of the child prior to birth by setting aside all scientific evidence, not to mention common sense. The inanity of these decisions is clear, but apparently to some, how to go about undoing the damage they have done is not. <br /><br />
This is where the human personhood movement comes in, and it’s about time Catholic bishops thought about this from a perspective not clouded by the politics of false prudence, legal positivism or incrementalism. Too many dead bodies lie on that road; it’s time to change course!<br /><br />
There is no reliance within the human personhood movement on unpredictable courts, Your Excellencies. There is a firm, undeniable reliance on exact scientific evidence, which leads to the philosophical conclusion that a human being, from his or her beginning, is a human person. This is proven beyond doubt by studying the facts, not by fearing or misrepresenting court decisions. As a matter of fact, the human personhood movement does not address <em>Roe v. Wade </em>or <em>Doe v. Bolton</em>, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />
Pro-life Americans, including Roman Catholic bishops and their associates in the various state Catholic conferences, have to move beyond the politics and understand that <em>Roe</em> and <em>Doe</em> are symptomatic of a culture that long ago set out on the path of dehumanizing vulnerable persons. <em>Roe</em> and <em>Doe</em> were the result of a permissive attitude toward denying the personhood of human beings deemed “inconvenient” or “undesirable.” <br /><br />
If we honestly examine the Supreme Court’s infamous <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3827&amp;F=H">Dred Scott</a> </em>decision,&#160;we learn a valuable lesson. The Supreme Court never recanted or overturned the prejudice on display in that decision. Citizens took it upon themselves to correct the injustices being perpetrated throughout society and by government against members of the human race. The result was a movement to renew the culture and restore justice by way of a constitutional amendment. <br /><br />
Similarly, it is not the human personhood movement’s goal to overturn <em>Roe</em> and <em>Doe</em>. Our goal is to restore recognition of personhood to all human beings. We do not need the court’s permission to do that.<br /><br />
It occurs to me that this fact flies in the face of all that the so-called leading pro-life attorneys have been saying&#160;to Catholic bishops nationwide.&#160;First and foremost, there is no human being who exists because of the Supreme Court, Congress or any other body of individuals. Each exists by the grace of God, His creative power and His endowment of personhood at the instant a human being is created. There is no doubt about this, particularly if one is a person of deep religious faith, as is each Catholic bishop.<br /><br />
Further, the human personhood movement relies heavily on a two-pronged educational strategy. We share the science and then we share the reasoning behind the movement. This is why we can state unhesitatingly that not only is legal recognition of human personhood the right goal for pro-life Americans, it is only logical way for society to once again acknowledge the truth of who the human being is and why each is so precious.<br /><br />
We encourage the Catholic bishops of Montana and elsewhere to set aside the disingenuous argument that the passage of a personhood amendment to a state constitution "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3829&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">might trigger an appellate process that could strengthen <em>Roe v. Wade</em></font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">.”&#160;There is absolutely no way that anyone knows whether or not such a trigger would be pulled, but we all know that maintaining the status quo is unthinkable. <br /><br />
We cannot be satisfied, as servants of life and, more importantly, servants of God, with the “</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3832&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">common sense" restrictions</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;on abortion that seem to be the standard fare offered by many, including those leading pro-life attorneys relied upon by Montana’s bishops. It has never been the pro-life movement’s goal to&#160;restrict the killing so that it happens less.&#160;If one knows that the act of abortion is murder, then how could we ever defend the argument that restricting acts of murder so that fewer people are murdered is a worthy goal? What sort of twisted idea is that?<br /><br />
Also contained in the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3829&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Montana Catholic Conference</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> statement is the following strategic recommendation:&#160;</font></strong></p><blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="96"><strong><font size="4">The key to advancing the culture of life in Montana is addressing the privacy provision in our state constitution which provides a right to abortion. Therefore, we are working with constitutional experts to develop an amendment which would exclude abortion from the privacy provision in the state constitution. <br /><br />
Passing such a constitutional amendment would open the way to addressing real change in the state. We could then pass laws to enact restrictions such as requiring short waiting periods before an abortion can be performed and requiring parental notification in cases when the person seeking an abortion is under age. These restrictions have been noted in a recent study as being effective in reducing abortion. Passage of such laws would save numerous lives on the way to changing hearts and minds as we work to achieve our ultimate goal of overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="97"><strong><font size="4">This statement confirms my worst suspicions. Let me be perfectly clear.<br /><br />
There is no legitimate right to privacy in matters of life and death. No one can in good conscience argue that a “right to privacy” permits murder. Further there is no right to abortion, as Pope John Paul II reminded us in <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=317&amp;F=H">Evangelium Vitae</a> </em>(#20) when he taught what the consequences of such an argument&#160;are:&#160;</font></strong></p><blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="98"><strong><font size="4">To claim the right to abortion, infanticide and euthanasia, and to recognize that right in law, means to attribute to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: that of an absolute power over others and against others. This is the death of true freedom: “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin” (Jn 8:34).</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1260401532969="99"><strong><font size="4">There is no doubt that the type of amendment that the Montana Catholic Conference is proposing would lead to a recognition of aborting a human being as a legitimate practice as long as such a practice was restricted in some way. The&#160;skewed thinking behind such a proposal is too inconceivable to even contemplate. <br /><br />
It is my fervent hope and prayer that Most Rev. George Leo Thomas, bishop of the Diocese of Helena, and Most Rev. Michael W. Warfel, bishop of the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings, will reexamine why they would endorse a flawed policy and oppose human personhood efforts in their state. <br /><br />
The unity of purpose that once made the pro-life movement in America so great was that we understood that unless and until every innocent human being was equally protected under the law and in the culture, there would be no end to the senseless murder of the innocent. That unity of purpose appears to have died, and we strive to revive that as well.<br /><br />
We are praying that our Catholic bishops will lead the way toward this lost unity of purpose, for as Saint Thomas Aquinas explained,&#160; “[H]uman law is law inasmuch as it is in conformity with right reason and thus derives from the eternal law. But when a law is contrary to reason, it is called an unjust law; but in this case it ceases to be a law and becomes instead an act of violence” (</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=536&amp;L=3824&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Evangelium Vitae</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> #72). <br /><br />

Why do we insist on using the word “person” in our fight against the attacks on human dignity? Why not define when life begins or what a human being is? To understand this, we must first understand&#160;the meaning of the word “person.” The word “person” has different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="97"><strong><font size="4">In a theological context, the word “person” refers to the union of the physical and the spiritual, in other words,&#160;body and&#160;soul. In <em>Evangelium Vitae</em>, Pope John Paul II asks the rhetorical question, how could a human individual not be a human person? In other words, the Catholic teaching that a human individual is also a human person is a self-evident truth.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="98"><strong><font size="4">Within the context of an atheistic philosophy, the term “person” is defined by a set of utilitarian qualities: Is the human being self-aware? Does he or she have the capacity to reason? Can he or she live independently and develop relationships? All of these are the complete opposite of what our faith teaches. Human dignity comes not from our differing abilities and qualities, but from God Himself, Who is the Author/Creator of every human individual’s life.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="99"><strong><font size="4">In a legal context, a proper definition of the word “person” is of extreme importance.The United States Constitution uses the word “person” 49 times. On the other hand, it never uses the word “human being” or “human life” or even just “human.” The reason is quite simple: The Constitution is primarily concerned with rights, and the term&#160;for&#160;one who is recognized by law as having rights and duties is “person.”</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="100"><strong><font size="4">In the case of <em>Colorado v. <a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=236436&amp;N=531&amp;L=3799&amp;F=H">Lage</a> </em>(2009), a man who crashed his car head-on into a car driven by an eight-and-a-half months expectant mother, was able to avoid being charged with killing the child in the womb because the court felt “compelled by the legislature’s definition of a 'person,'” which only considered a human being to be a “person” after birth.

But more eloquent than all of the rational and legal arguments that I can offer are the deeply insightful and inspired words of our beloved John Paul the Great. This great defender of life wrote, “[W]hen freedom is detached from objective truth it becomes impossible to establish personal rights on a firm rational basis; and the ground is laid for society to be at the mercy of the unrestrained will of individuals or the oppressive totalitarianism of public authority” (<em>EV</em>, # 96).</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="104"><strong><font size="4">These words answer all the arguments against personhood.

In other words, focus on education; focus on the principle.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1260229705555="106"><strong><font size="4">The Personhood Amendment first and foremost aims at a cultural transformation that will form consciences “with regard to the incomparable and inviolable worth of every human life” (<em>EV</em>, #96).

Each person is unique and distinctly different from the next person.</font></strong></p><p jquery1259849178330="76"><strong><font size="4">The book of Jeremiah tells us that before we were created, God knew us.

This principle is stated in the Constitution of the United States; it is as basic as the very fact of our existence. The founders of our country wrote in the Declaration of Independence that we Americans consider this truth self-evident: all people are “endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.” In other words, human rights come from God and this is obvious to everyone. Among these rights, they said, is the right to life.</font></strong></p><p jquery1259849178330="78"><strong><font size="4">I would find it impossible to be deeply involved in the pro-life movement if I didn’t have religious convictions about when human life begins.

The term “a human being’s life” is more accurate.<br />
&#160;<br />
Although "conception" is commonly used by the general public, it is expressly and universally rejected as a scientific term by embryologists, scientists and medical professionals, and thus does not adequately support the concept of personhood.&#160;In addition, the term is not always understood to refer to the act of fertilization, the sexual reproductive process which is initiated upon first contact of the human sperm and human oocyte, and is often erroneously taken to mean “implantation,” the process by which a preborn child up to two weeks old attaches to the mother’s uterine wall.<br />
&#160;<br />
&#160;In many states, as well as in literally dozens of national and international medical and research organizations (including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), the term "conception" is now erroneously defined as "beginning at implantation."

As personhood advocates, it is critically important that we use the correct terminology to describe preborn babies, their mothers, the very act of abortion and even the facilities in which abortions are committed. It doesn’t matter if you are a full time pro-life advocate or a “normal” person who works, goes to school, takes care of your family, etc. We must all watch what we say in daily life—even in casual conversation.<br /><br />
So, the words we use are very powerful and can make the difference between life and death. You might be surprised to realize that even we pro-lifers often use terms and phrases that can be dehumanizing to the very people we are trying to save. That can cause confusion and can hamper our efforts to obtain recognition of the human rights of all human persons. As we educate the public and advocate for the rights of all human persons, born and preborn, we must seriously examine the language we use and make some changes, if necessary.<br /><br />
With that in mind, I am going to share with you this short list of terms and phrases that we should drop from our pro-life vocabulary:</font></strong></p><blockquote><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="96" jquery1258503224200="96"><strong><font size="4">1.&#160;Fetus, embryo—These terms are generally used by abortion supporters, but I also notice pro-lifers using these terms often. Fetus and embryo are actually terms referring to stages of development. Their use begs the question, which animal species, during its embryonic or fetal development, are you referring to? For human beings, embryo describes human development from the very beginning of a human being’s life through their eighth week of development. Fetus describes a human being’s biological development from the beginning of their ninth week of development until birth. We should replace these terms with “human embryo,” “human fetus” or “human being during their embryonic (or fetal) development.”</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="97" jquery1258503224200="97"><strong><font size="4">2.&#160;Fertilized egg—This is a dehumanizing term used as a form of pro-abortion propaganda. It is not a legitimate term, since it isn’t scientifically accurate. Women don’t carry eggs; they have oocytes. Upon first contact of a human sperm and a human oocyte, a newly created human person now exists who is in his/her first embryonic stage of development. This term has become popular with abortion advocates these days, in response to the state personhood initiatives cropping up around the country. We need to correct this whenever we see or hear it. Use correct terminology in its place, such as “human embryo.”</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="98" jquery1258503224200="98"><strong><font size="4">3.&#160;Mistake, accident, unwanted, unplanned— These terms have very negative connotations and are very demeaning, especially for the child who happens to overhear some mention of the circumstances in which he or she came into being. Every child is wanted by someone and no one is an accident. God creates every single person with a special purpose in life. A positive-sounding term such as “surprise” should be used instead of terms or phrases that imply that God’s creation of a baby is an unfortunate event.</font></strong></p><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="99" jquery1258503224200="99"><strong><font size="4">4.&#160;Pro-choice—This term was developed by a marketing firm employed by the abortion lobby before abortion became decriminalized on January 22, 1973. It has been and still is a very effective term, but is very misleading. It begs the question, what is the choice? The child has no choice when threatened with an abortionist’s suction device, knives and forceps. Replace this term with “pro-abortion” or “abortion advocate.”<br /><br />
5.&#160;Pregnant woman—This term takes the child out of the equation and can make pregnancy sound like a disease. Abortion is often referred to as “terminating a pregnancy.” Instead, use terms such as “mother,” “pregnant mom” or “expectant mother.” <br /><br />
6.&#160;Health clinic/abortion clinic—“Health” gives the impression that health is being restored to an individual. Similarly, “clinic” normally denotes a respectable, morally legitimate health care facility. Abortion is murder, not health care, so we should not dignify it with such terms. Replace such terms with “abortion business,” “abortion mill,” “abortion facility,” “abortion center” and so forth. <br /><br />
7.&#160;The abortion issue—Taxes are an issue. Paying for education is an issue. Abortion is not an issue; it’s a tragedy. Abortion is a violent crime that kills a human person and leaves his/her mother scarred for life. You can also replace issue with terms such as “question,” “matter,” etc. <br /><br />
8.&#160;It—A baby boy or baby girl is not an it. Yet that is how many of us refer to children in utero or even at the moment of their birth. I hear this so often: “It’s a (boy/girl)!” Instead, say, “He is a boy” or “She is a girl” or “My/our/their/his/her/the baby is a (boy/girl).” <br /><br />
9.&#160;I’m going to be a ___!—This phrase usually ends with “mother,” “father,” “grandparent,” “aunt,” “uncle,” etc., But it’s inaccurate and dehumanizes the baby, because actually, it’s a done deal! The person speaking is already a mother (or father, grandparent, etc.). If you catch someone (or yourself) saying this, quickly correct it by reminding them (or yourself) that the child already exists, so they (or you) are already a mother (or father, grandparent, etc.).</font></strong></p></blockquote><p align="left" jquery1258504266320="100" jquery1258503224200="100"><strong><font size="4">This is in no way an exhaustive list.
