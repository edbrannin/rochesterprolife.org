And once again, the bishops are silent.<br /><br />
The New York Times reported that in his later moments, Senator Kennedy began attending daily Mass, prayed often, and called for Father Patrick Tarrant moments before his death on Tuesday evening. <br /><br />
“The deaths of untold millions of preborn babies rested on the conscience of Ted Kennedy,” said Judie Brown, president of American Life League. “There is an impending disaster about to take place at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica. Senator Edward Kennedy spent the past 30 years doing all he could to advocate and support the act of procured abortion - including his divorce, remarriage, et cetera -- and yet he continued to call himself Catholic,” stated Brown. “These are public matters, not private.”<br /><br />
“If we are led to assume Kennedy was remorseful of his pro-abortion past and repented, Boston Cardinal Sean O’Malley should make this known to the Catholic faithful clearly – before the media and pro-abortion politicians turn Kennedy’s death and Mass honoring his memory into yet another victory,” said Brown. “If this remains unclear, what will millions of Catholic Americans be led to believe as Obama canonizes Kennedy’s pro-abortion legacy on live television?”<br /><br />
“The truth does not change because of the respect the world is paying to this man.&#160; The Catholic principles which Cardinal Sean O’Malley has sworn to uphold have not disappeared because of Senator Kennedy's death,” continued Brown. “If this funeral Mass proceeds as planned, Sen. Edward Kennedy will have spit one more time on Christ, this time from a casket.” <br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942. <br />

While the White House has now explained&#160;this remark as the president describing opponents of his health care debacle as agitated bed wetters, the truth is sobering”not silly. In fact, Obama's opponents are perhaps a bit more honest than he would like; thus, the insults.<br /><br />
Having said that, the worrying fact is that there&#160;is still an enormous number of well-meaning people, including Catholics, who simply do not want to see the truth about what is and is not contained in the various proposals currently floating around Congress. One example recently came my way via a Facebook comment.<br /><br />
A very sincere Catholic&#160;wrote to me about American Life League's opposition to the "health care reform" plan, even though our concerns stem from the fact that the proposals are based on imposed death as a cost-saving measure. The more I read and reread her earnest viewpoint on the matter, the more I am convinced that far too many Catholic Americans have never heard of the Church's&#160;teachings. Either that, or they do not understand and accept them. Such confusion results from a type of Catholic ignorance which Americans like Obama count on, day in and day out.<br /><br />
I am so concerned about it that I want to share her comments and then provide the reasons why she is fundamentally misguided.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Dear Ms. Brown,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">I am also a Catholic. I do not believe in abortion and have marched many times in the annual March for Life. I have been ridiculed by onlookers but have always stood firm in my beliefs. Nevertheless, I believe President Obama is a good man. I believe if he says he is not in fact planning to fund abortions that his health care package will not fund them. I believe in everything he stands for except this one thing. I know it is a very BIG thing. But I believe in nothing the Republican Party stands for except this one thing. I stand with the Pro-Life Democrats (most of whom are Catholics) because I believe in uplifting the poor, the worker, the homeless and downtrodden. I believe in cleaning up and taking responsibility for our environment and endangered animals. I believe that life is sacred, Ms. Brown, even the lives of the millions already here who, maybe through no fault of their own, maybe through their own fault, need a hand up. I believe if we have a government that can help, that needs to happen if we are to follow the footsteps of Christ as a nation...</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">This should not be a political issue at all, and you, Ms. Brown, should do your work in that way, not involving yourself in politics.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">If, in fact, abortions are funded, you can expose that once the legislation takes effect. I do not believe the president is a liar so I do not believe they will be funded. In any case, it will not cause more abortions to take place than would have taken place otherwise. And it will definitely not be tax dollars that pay for abortions since the dollars the program will run on will not be tax dollars. Anyone who wants to opt out can certainly do that and pay nothing.&#160; B.E.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">My correspondent does not understand that pro-life organizations and spokespeople who maintain their credibility are those who have not and will not align themselves with any political party. The reason for this is simple: Our party, if you will, consists of those who have no voice, either because they are not yet born or are in danger of becoming victims of euthanasia. They are people incapable of defending their right to life. These human beings do not wear a partisan label; they wear only a hope that we will defend them and be their voice.<br /><br />
B.E.'s belief in <em>uplifting the poor, the worker, the homeless and downtrodden </em>is not only a reflection of the Beatitudes, in which we all should believe, but a fundamental mandate for pro-life people, because our commitment to human dignity does not end at birth, nor does it end with imposed death. We are pro-life in every sense and stand with B.E.<br /><br />
When B.E. goes on to express her belief in being responsible for the earth and all that is a part of it, she reflects the stewardship that God has assigned to us. It is indeed our responsibility to respect and care for that which He has created and entrusted to us, His children. In fact, it is what Pope John Paul II described in <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2387&amp;F=H">Centesimus annus</a>&#160;</em>as the foundational characteristic of a just culture:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">All human activity takes place within a culture and interacts with culture. For an adequate formation of a culture, the involvement of the whole man is required, whereby he exercises his creativity, intelligence, and knowledge of the world and of people. Furthermore, he displays his capacity for self-control, personal sacrifice, solidarity and readiness to promote the common good. (Section 51)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">And it is here, at this critical juncture between the individual and his fellow man, that a serious rupture occurs between what is perceived by some as the U.S. president's honorable goals and the reality of what he intends. <br /><br />
There can be no solidarity unless man accepts his moral obligation to defend the weakest in our midst. As anyone who follows American Life League's mission knows, there are countless numbers of preborn children killed daily&#160;by human embryonic stem cell research, early abortion chemicals marketed as contraceptives, as well as surgical and medical abortion. Each of these individual persons is a member&#160;of our human family, and their fate is part of our responsibility if, indeed, we wish to live in a just society.<br /><br />
So, when President </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2394&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;claims, for example, that we who have found abortion in the "health care reform" proposals are â€œbearing false witness&#160;against him, we decry his arrogance. Perhaps B.E. has not seen the fallacy of his public pronouncements, but all one needs to do, really, is examine the legislation, as we at American Life League did in our latest <em>ALL Report</em>, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2386&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obamacare</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">: Abortion's Trojan Horse.&#160;The viewer can read about abortion in at least one of the bills by viewing actual statements from the bill that are exhibited in this video.<br /><br />
Or review the statements of&#160;</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2395&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">ABC News</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> chief medical editor, Dr. Timothy Johnson,&#160;who, among others, says, If you look at the language, it gets complicated. It's not crystal clear whether or not that could happen with a so-called public option, and even with private plans that might be subsidized by the government, maybe abortion would be allowed.<br />
So who is the one deceiving the public? Even though B.E. does not believe that the president is a liar, she needs to examine the factual evidence, not for the purpose of making a pejorative judgment about anyone, but to inform herself so that she understands what is being said versus what is being promoted.<br /><br />
If, as B.E. suggests, we remain silent now and ignore the evils contained in the various "health care reform" bills, it would not be spiritually healthy for any of us, nor would it be politically feasible to go back and fix the problem later! Pro-lifers have heard that argument regarding other pieces of legislation. We have learned from painful experience that, in politics, usually nothing is improved in order to agree with Godâ€™s word. Usually,&#160;revisions result in more evil. The sad history of the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2388&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Hyde Amendment</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;which allegedly bars the use of tax dollars to pay for abortion, is a testimony to such failure.<br /><br />
No, the time to fix the deadly aspects of "health care reform" proposals is now. The time to see that justice is done for one and all is <em>now</em>, not later.<br /><br />
Finally, on a personal note and as one Catholic to another, B.E., let me say that, as Catholics, we know how to reach out to those in danger of dying because they do not have adequate health insurance or because their health care is nonexistent. We know because we learned it from and some of us have witnessed it in the work of Mother Teresa and countless others whose names are not readily known, all of whose work has left a legacy of love. It is called charity! It is the willingness of one community of faithful people to reach out and give of itself for the good of others.<br /><br />
The federal government has never understood charity, and it is not a source of Christ-like care. It is a bloated bureaucracy badly in need of cost-cutting measures, and that is the most fearful of truths when honestly assessing what â€œhealth care reform is actually all about. The American Health Care Association says seniors would face billions of dollars in </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2389&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Medicare</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> cuts.&#160;<br /><br />
That does not sound like good news to me! It is a warning and should be uppermost in B.E.'s thoughts and prayers as she continues, as each of us should, to be concerned for the most vulnerable in our midst. <br /><br />
God save us from silly phrases and deadly agendas.</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="5">Associate Newsletter</font></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Volume 6, Number 29&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">August 3,&#160;2009</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">New Associate Groups<br /><br />

If you divide the land of the earth into square kilometers, about half have nobody living in them. While large numbers of people believe that some land is more desirable than other land, experience shows that people differ. Millions want, and do, live in desert, mountain, cold, jungle or other climates that others might consider unlivable.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">If everyone were huddled together in a big ball, the ball would be about one half kilometer (1/4 mile) in radius.

If everybody in the world wanted to lie down on one flat surface with nobody touching anybody else, you could put all in about 650 square miles.

From <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">After reading accounts such as those in our previous newsletters, many people ask staff and supporters of STOPP, “Why do you people do this?”&#160; Many, including Planned Parenthood, do not understand what makes us expend this type of effort for no material gain.&#160; They don’t understand what is so bad about Planned Parenthood programs that gets people upset enough to basically give up all of their free time to fight for the demise of these programs.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">We will now take a look at the basic philosophies of Planned Parenthood as they relate to the subjects taught in typical Family Life Education programs.&#160; Our source for determining these philosophies is a book entitled <em>How to Talk with Your Child About Sexuality</em> which was written by Faye Wattleton while she was president of Planned Parenthood (Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., Garden City, New York; copyright 1986 Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.).</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The stated intent of this book (page 5) is to provide parents with information on the subject of sexuality so that these parents can become “the best source” of information for their children.&#160; The book then proceeds to offer information on a variety topics concerning sexuality.&#160; Of particular interest is some of the information provided in Chapter 7, “The Top Seven Questions.”&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The first two of the “top seven” questions deal with the physical changes of boys and girls during puberty and the wording is, on the whole, informative and accurate.&#160; However, included in this section on puberty is a topic almost always included in Planned Parenthood literature – masturbation.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Wattleton’s book states that the “modern view” of masturbation is that it is a natural and harmless expression of sexuality.&#160; The advice given to parents who see a small child fondling himself for the first time is to use the occurrence as a “teachable moment,” reassuring the child that masturbation is “something practically everyone does because it feels good…and that there’s nothing wrong with it.”&#160; Planned Parenthood also tells parents that “…many boys, at some point in their development, make it a group event with one or more boys.”</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Another of the “top seven questions” deals with discussing intercourse and pregnancy with your children.&#160; The book strongly recommends that these conversations take place with 10 to 12 year olds.&#160; While the book encourages frank discussion of these topics and the parents’ values, it also states that teenagers have the right to make their own decisions on this matter and that parents actually “owe” them certain reassurances if they choose to become promiscuous! </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">It should be noted that Planned Parenthood has a major adversary in this pushing of sex education on young children.&#160; Sigmund Freud contended that the period of life from six to twelve years was, normally, a “sexual latency” period where one usually suppresses sexual interest and develops other important behavioral capabilities.&#160; Freud, in fact, states that an undue dwelling on sexual matters during this time of life would hinder a person’s normal development.&#160; Freud’s concept is so well accepted that Wattleton had to take the time to address it in her book.&#160; On page 52, Wattleton brings up the Freud “latency idea” and then dismisses it in three short paragraphs.&#160; The book describes a “more widely accepted view” that sex education for this age group is okay but does so without citing any scientific studies or giving the name of even one reputable scientist who agrees.&#160; It obviously doesn’t fit their philosophy, so they dismiss it.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">On the other side of the issue, psychologist Melvin Anchell wrote in a 1986 edition of <em>National Review</em> of the accuracy of Freud’s “latency period” and goes so far to say that today’s sex education programs for the young are DIAGRAMS FOR DISASTER!&#160; And which one of us, after viewing the state of our nation following years of this garbage in our schools, would disagree?</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Next month:&#160; Planned Parenthood philosophies continued.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3"><em>Unborn child's memory develops by 30 weeks in the womb: New research<br /></em>30-week-old babies in the womb already have short-term memory capabilities, a new study from the Netherlands, published in the July/August 2009 issue of the journal <em>Child Development</em>, has found.&#160; The scientists found that at thirty weeks, the child in the womb has a short-term memory of about ten minutes.

Baby Steps joins the ALL Associate Program which has grown, in the past five years, from just 29 to 100 (and counting!) groups in over half of the states in the nation, plus associated groups in Canada and Africa.<br /><br />
“As the personhood movement gains momentum around the country, more and more grassroots organizations are ready to fight for human rights for all human beings,” said Judie Brown, president of American Life League. “After 36 years of legalized murder in this country, the grassroots are shouting, ‘No more!’ And ALL’s Associate Program provides a community dedicated to the same mission – personhood.”<br /><br />
The new group, Baby Steps, based in Carbondale, Co., one of the most pro-abortion areas of the state, is a collaboration between members of two Roman Catholic parishes – St. Vincent and St. Mary of the Crown. The group is dedicated to supporting personhood through the needs of men and women in crisis pregnancies with everyday help, prayer, education and activism.<br /><br />
“Our goal is to teach personhood,” said Bonnie Kowar, co-founder of Baby Steps.&#160; “Our feeling is that once the Holy Spirit helps create the understanding of personhood in one’s heart, the rest of the truths will follow.”<br /><br />
“Real cultural change happens and lives are saved at the grassroots level,” Brown said. “We are so excited to work with Baby Steps and our 99 other Associates working around the clock to defeat what Pope John Paul II named the culture of death.”<br /><br />
According to Fr. Saenz, chaplain of Baby Steps, this new collaboration means their best efforts are yet to come.&#160; “American Life League is the nation’s premier organization working to end abortion and establish a true Culture of Life in our country. We are excited to join their nationwide family and look forward to working with them for a very long time to come,” said Fr. Saenz.<br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942. <br />

There is, rather, an already existing embryo.&#160;But, the "pre-embryo" has been institutionalized, so "stage two" of this sort of verbal deception begins by substituting other false "science" in its place – or simply leaving out legitimate early phases of human embryonic development as if they didn't exist. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">"<em>Pre-embryo Substitutes</em>" </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">One example of this is to claim that the "zygote" is the beginning of when a human being begins to exist. But this would render the human being already existing before the formation of the "zygote" non-existent.&#160; By claiming he or she is neither a human being nor a human person, it can be used simply as "biological material", especially in human genetic engineering research, etc. This "biological entity" is often referred to in the literature as a "pre-zygote" - that is, what is there from the beginning of fertilization up to the formation of the zygote is not a human embryo or a human being. It is just a human "cell.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">However, the Carnegie Stages of Early Human Embryonic Development make it clear that the "zygote" formed at the end of the process of fertilization is not when a new human being begins to exist. Before that, the developing embryo (in Stage 1 of the Carnegie Stages) begins with "first contact" of the sperm with the oocyte, followed by, respectively, the phases of development referred to as "the penetrated oocyte" and the "ootid."&#160; In other words, the new human embryo begins to exist at first contact, at the beginning of the process of fertilization. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Another example of leaving out specific stages of early human embryonic development can be found in several definitions in laws and regulations. A classic example are the formal definitions of "fetus" and "pregnancy" in federal guidelines for the use of human subjects in research as both "beginning at implantation". [A]ll women (rather than just those undergoing IVF or ART) become pregnant only at implantation; before that they are not "pregnant" [and therefore, the use of abortifacients, embryo flushing, prenatal genetic diagnosis, as well as all manner of human embryo research, are "ethical"].</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Or, one can add to specific stages of early human embryonic development. Look at a more recent example:</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">"Embryos are no different in their essential humanity from a fetus in the womb, a 10-year old boy, or a 100-year old woman. At every stage of development, human beings (whether zygote, blastocyst, embryo, fetus, infant, adolescent or adult) retain their identity as an enduring being that grows toward its subsequent stage(s); embryos are integral beings structured for maturation along their proper time line." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The order of scientific terms that should inclusively mean the embryo at all of its various early stages is shifted. Listing the term "embryo" after them, as if what came before was not an embryo, makes the embryo during those earliest of phases of development essentially disappear. Thus we have this following subtle but spurious "pre-embryo substitute" which for all the world sounds very prolife.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">To the casual observer, by adding the term "embryo" after the terms "zygote" and "blastocyst" - followed by "fetus", "infant", etc. -- it would appear that the "zygote" and the "blastocyst" are something other than an "embryo" when, in fact, these are early stages of embryonic development. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Again, one can make a "pre-embryo substitute" by articulating only one kind of human reproduction. For example, one can claim that all human beings begin to exist at "fertilization" or at "conception". But by definition, that makes all human beings reproduced asexually disappear.<br />
&#160;<br />
Perhaps the most daring, and most successful, "pre-embryo substitute" was concocted by human cloning and human embryonic stem cell researchers Irving Weissman, Michael West, et al. For these researchers, the immediate product of both sexual and asexual human reproduction is "just a cell" - not a human being, not a human organism, not a human embryo. And the "blastocyst" from which "stem cells" are derived is simply "a ball of cells." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">These researchers also concocted another way to get rid of the human embryo - in fact, they got rid of the human embryo and the human fetus - by making a false distinction between "therapeutic" and "reproductive" cloning. They claimed that the product of "therapeutic cloning" was just a bunch of cells; the product of "reproductive cloning" was a human being - but not until it was born! They also enjoyed defining "cloning" only in terms of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) - thus making all of the other dozens of kinds of human cloning techniques disappear. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Indeed, such "pre-embryos" and "pre-embryo substitutes" as noted above are particularly useful in laws and regulations involving the early human embryo, because often such innovative and imaginative but false scientific terms used in legal definitions are legally "exclusionary" - and thus create useful legal loopholes. It's enough to make our collective heads spin! </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Correct Formation of Conscience</em> </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">As noted, the abuse of language concerning the early human embryo is an ongoing concern; ever new, inventive and imaginative "pre-embryo substitutes" appear almost on a daily basis. This is why it is important to be aware of and acknowledge the long-established and documented empirical facts of human embryology.<br />

As Pope John Paul II warned, <br /><br />
“The end result of this is tragic: not only is the fact of the destruction of so many human lives still to be born or in their final stage extremely grave and disturbing, but no less grave and disturbing is the fact that conscience itself, darkened as it were by such widespread conditioning, is finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between good and evil in what concerns the basic value of human life... </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">“...[W]e need now more than ever to have the courage to look the truth in the eye and to call things by their proper name, without yielding to convenient compromises or to the temptation of self-deception...

But no word has the power to change the reality of things.”&#160; (Pope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium Vitae,</em> 1995, Sections&#160;4 and 58). </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Consuming secondhand steroids<br /></em>[F]ew in the general public are aware that oral contraceptives ("the Pill"), levonorgestrel ("the morning-after pill"), and mifepristone, or RU-486 ("the abortion pill"), are also all steroids.

Indeed, especially over the last 40 years or so, the value of human life has diminished steadily and rapidly – especially with regard to its "beginning.” Yet, even aside from the important and significant "personhood" debates, the Church has consistently taught that the mere fact that there is a living innocent human being before us is sufficient to safeguard the life of that human being even at its very beginning. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">But precisely when is "the first moment of its existence"?</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Without doubt, the abuse of language, especially scientific "language," has shrouded clear facts about precisely when the "first moment of its existence is," and has hastened this drastic decline in the respect for human life. This linguistic abuse has been both purposeful as well as naively equivocal. That is, it is not just because of the willful and devious use of language by ardent supporters of [the culture of death], but also because even many of those who are dedicated to this "safeguarding" themselves fall victim to the use of erroneous "scientific" terms. The result is an amazingly long list over the decades of what I have often referred to as "pre-embryo substitutes." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Given that this linguistic phenomenon continues unabated as we speak, it might be of help to remind ourselves of how very subtly these linguistic twists can come about so that we can be more sensitive to identifying them. Generally speaking, there are a number of ways that the misuse of simple scientific "language" can slip into our rhetoric and our thinking processes without notice. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The 'Pre-Embryo'</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">First, it is to be noted historically that the authors of the now officially rejected false scientific term "pre-embryo" were a Catholic Jesuit priest and a Catholic frog biologist – Fr. Richard McCormick and Clifford Grobstein. According to them, there is an important scientific and moral distinction to be made between a "human being" and a "human person." That is, they agreed that the immediate product of fertilization was a human being (a "genetic individual"), but before 14-days it was not yet a human person (a "developmental individual") with a rational soul, and thus with the same ethical and legal rights and protections as all other human persons. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Before 14-days there was just a "pre-embryo," a "non-person," and although it should be "respected," it is still ethical to kill this "pre-embryo" for proportionate reasons. Of course, this "distinction" of McCormick and Grobstein between a "human being" and a "human person" is a false distinction, a "distinction" without a real difference. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">This false pseudo-scientific term "pre-embryo," and its accompanying false term "individuality," was finally, formally rejected by the international nomenclature committee in human embryology. That committee made it clear that, at fertilization (sexual human reproduction), the "embryo" begins to exist immediately. Thus, scientifically, there is no such thing as a "pre-embryo" that exists after fertilization and before 14-days. There is, rather, an already existing embryo. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">However, the "pre-embryo" had already been institutionalized by then (even around the world), and many on both sides of the aisle were not happy with this formal scientific refutation of their supra-useful linguistic invention. For those who wanted to pursue IVF, abortion, research, etc., they would have to come up with some other false scientific terms to scientifically "justify" what they wanted to do. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">And thus began "stage two" of this sort of verbal deception required to "scientifically" justify all manner of projects with the early human embryo. This "stage" I have often referred to as consisting of "pre-embryo substitutes." That is, the term "pre-embryo" must now necessarily be dropped, but the same agenda could be accomplished by substituting other false "science" in its place, or simply leaving out legitimate early phases of human embryonic development as if they didn't exist. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Next week:&#160; Part 2 – “Pre-embryo substitutes”<br /></font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Generic Plan B pregnancy prevention approved for teens<br /></em>A generic version of the morning-after-pill known as Plan B has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for prescription use by women aged 17 and under.

“Planned Parenthood and the birth control industry would have you believe Plan B One-Step cannot cause an abortion. That is a lie.<br /><br />
“In 1965, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a Terminology Bulletin that ‘officially’ changed the definition of “conception” from the union of sperm and egg to implantation. As a result, the medical establishment does not call the killing of a human being prior to implantation an abortion. But that is just semantics.<br /><br />
“Plan B One-Step works like any other abortifacient drug: It can alter (thin) the lining (endometrium) of the mother’s uterus so that the newly-formed baby cannot implant and thus dies. Plan B One-Step’s product information itself states, “It may inhibit implantation (by altering the endometrium).” Direct abortion is the willful ending of a preborn human being’s life. Plan B One-Step is thus a direct abortion method. Women should not allow themselves to be misled by sales representatives for Plan B and Plan B One-Step, who claim that these products will not terminate an existing pregnancy.<br /><br />
“Unfortunately, the birth control industry and Planned Parenthood – the nation’s largest abortion chain – have tricked many women into aborting their tiny children. Plan B One-Step, Plan B, the birth control pill, IUD and other hormonal birth control products can all cause abortions. Period.<br /><br />
“So, the next time you hear that Plan B or Plan B One-Step cannot cause an abortion, you will know the truth. Plan B products kill.”<br /><br />

“Laws, Lies and Videotape” is currently available on American Life League’s home page, www.all.org&lt;http://www.all.org/&gt; and on YouTube under the same title.<br /><br />

&#160;<br />
Take, for instance, this quote by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1661&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Elisabeth Garber-Paul</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> in an article&#160;on the rise in sexual activity during this economic recession: So join the rest of America in this exciting new trend. Save money, stay in, have sexjust don't make a baby.<br />
&#160;<br />
That's right, Elisabeth, throw respect for yourself out the window and spit in the face of God by removing one of his intentions for intercourse. More babies will just make the economy worse, right? Wrong. In fact, one of the reasons we are even in this recession is because of the plummeting birthrate. There simply aren't enough people to replace the retiring population in the workplace and pay for Social Security, or to stimulate the economy. <br />
&#160;<br />
Not that you'll hear about that&#160;from the anti-human, overpopulation zealots. But do your research. Watch&#160;<em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1674&amp;F=H">Demographic Winter&#160;</a></em> and&#160;<u><em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1674&amp;F=H">Demographic Bomb</a></em></u><em>,</em> two documentaries which debunk the overpopulation myth and ask a very important question: Is it possible we have been failed by the very ideas we thought could save us?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">It goes without saying that abortion advocates think saving sex for marriage is ludicrous and archaic. Just check out the title of a book just released by radical feminist </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1662&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Jessica Valenti</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">: <em>The Purity Myth: How America's Obsession with Virginity is Hurting Young Women</em>.&#160;<br /><br />
In an interview on the rabidly pro-abortion RH Reality Check&#160;web site, Valenti purports that teaching and honoring purity is just as dangerous as the media's pressure on sexuality and the hypersexualization of women. Oh, really? So, protecting young people from the heartbreak and emptiness of premarital sex, not to mention a load of sexually transmitted diseases, is akin to the objectification of women, the result of which has been a generation of depressed, confused girls with eating disorders?<br /><br />
She goes on to say.&#160; The purity myth is so embedded in our culture and our psyche. &#160;You don't have to be forcing your daughter to take a virginity pledge in order for the fiction of virginity to affect your life. Really? Then why does every Hollywood film end (or begin) with a couple jumping into bed together? If it's so embedded in our culture, then why are abortion, STD and teen pregnancy rates so high? (I'm not going to even legitimize her term fiction of virginity with a response).<br /><br />
As if that isn't enough, in Greensboro, North Carolina, a new program is paying high school girls <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> to get pregnant. That's right. For every day they stay baby-free, $1 is deposited into an account to be used for college. According to a local TV news report, the group was founded by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1624&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Hazel Brown</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;â€œa maternity nurse who thought too many teens were having babies.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Ms. Brown, how about seeing the root of the problem? <em>Too many teens are having premarital sex</em>. The problem is not the presence of a baby, but the actions of his mother and father, which resulted in his existence. <br /><br />
The three goals of this program, called </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1964&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">College Bound Sisters</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;are for the girls to â€œavoid pregnancy, graduate from high school and enroll in college, Brown said. Oh, what lofty goals we have for our young people!<br /><br />
Teenagers rise to the expectations that are set for them. If all we ask is that they avoid pregnancy (and we'll even pay them for that!), what are we teaching girls about sex, relationships, the value of children or personal responsibility, for that matter?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Instead of urging purity and self-control, and demonstrating the joys of a quiver full of children (Psalm 127:3-5) within marriage, this program bribes young girls. If those same girls were taught basic biblical morality, they wouldnâ€™t be having sex, and thus, there would be no chance of pregnancy.<br /><br />
The message of this program in a nutshell: Go ahead and sin against God by having damaging premarital sex, but just make sure you avoid one of the outcomes: babies. <br /><br />
If only young people knew the joy and blessings they are missing out on when they use sex for purely physical and selfish reasons! Then, and only then, would they cherish chastity as it should be cherished. <br /><br />
To my single friends reading this, please flee from this deadly mentality of me-first, pleasure-seeking sex without consequences. Seek righteousness, pursue holiness and practice chastity.&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
But understand this: There will be terrifying times in the last days. People will be self-centered and lovers of money, proud, haughty, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, irreligious, callous, implacable, slanderous, licentious, brutal, hating what is good, traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, as they make a pretense of religion but deny its power.

By John B. Shea, M.D., FRCP(C)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Contraception:<br /><br />
The Catholic Church teaches that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun, and, above all, directly willed and procured abortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are absolutely excluded as licit means of regulating birth. Equally excluded â€¦ is direct sterilization, whether perpetual or temporary, whether of the man or the woman. This teaching prohibits contraception by means of the condom, intrauterine device, vasectomy, tubal ligation and chemical contraception by the use of oral contraceptives, morning-after pills, or the administration of contraceptives by injection or in a skin patch. The reason for this prohibition is that contraception breaks the inseparable connection, willed by God and unable to be broken by man on his own initiative, between the unitive meaning and the procreative meaning of the conjugal act.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Contraception greatly dishonors marriage, the greatness of which is beautifully described by Dietrich von Hildebrand. No natural human good has been exalted so high in the New Testament. No other good has been chosen to become one of the Seven Sacraments. No other has been endowed with the honor of participating in the establishment of the Kingdom of God. The wonderful, divinely appointed relationship between the mysterious procreation of a new human being, and this most intimate communion of love&#160; illuminates the grandeur and solemnity of this union. Thus it is that in order to preserve the reverent attitude of the spouses toward the mystery of this union, this general connection between procreation and the communion of love must always be maintained.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">History has clearly demonstrated how prescient Pope Paul VI (1963-1978) was when he predicted that the practice of contraception would cause the man to lose respect for the woman, considering her a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment. The gigantic increase in the incidence of abortion and of sexually transmitted infections bears witness to the promiscuity that followed the legalization and wide availability of chemical contraceptives. The pope also warned of the danger that public authorities which take no heed of moral exigencies would try to solve problems of the community by means illicit for married couples. Witness the worldwide promotion of contraception and abortion fostered by the United Nations today, and also the mandatory one-child policy of the government of China.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Paul VI, in <em>Humanae vitae</em>, stated that if, then, there are serious motives to space out births, which derive from the physical or psychological conditions of husband and wife, or from external conditions, the Church teaches that it is then licit to take into account the natural rhythms immanent in the generative functions, for the use of marriage in the infecund periods only, and in this way to regulate births without offending the moral principles which have been recalled earlier.&#160; Pius XII taught that unless some serious circumstances arise, spouses are obliged to have children. However, he also teaches that it is moral for the spouses to limit their family size or even to refrain from having children altogether, if they have sufficiently serious reasons. He stated that â€œthere are serious motives, such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic, and social indications, that can except for a long time, perhaps even during the whole duration of the marriage, from the positive and obligatory carrying out of the act.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The 1965 Vatican document <em>The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World </em>(<em>Gaudium et spes</em>) teaches that â€œamong the married couples who thus fulfill their God-given mission, special mention should be made of those who after prudent reflection and common decisions, courageously undertake the proper upbringing of a large number of children. It also states that it is the duty of the parents, and of them alone, to decide on the number and spacing of children, and that they should take into consideration their own good and the good of their children already born or yet to come, and ability to read the signs of the times and of their own situation, on the material and spiritual level, and finally, an estimation of the good of the family, of society, and of the Church.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The morally acceptable way for spacing the birth of children is called â€œNatural Family Planning. One of the best methods is the Hilgers system. The effectiveness rates of this method for avoiding pregnancy have been shown to be 99.5 to 98.8 at the twelfth month of use. This compares favorably to the pill, of which Planned Parenthood's web site states, Of 100 women who use the Pill, only 8 will become pregnant during the first year of typical use.</font></strong></p><p><em><strong><font size="4">Relevant medical facts</font></strong></em></p><p><strong><font size="4">Some chemical contraceptives abort <em>all</em> of the time. All of them abort <em>some</em> of the time. They do this by preventing implantation of an embryo in the uterus.&#160; Elites in the medical profession try to justify their use of the word â€œcontraceptive by stating that there is no embryo before implantation. This statement is false. The science of human embryology demonstrated, over 100 years ago, that a new individual human being comes into existence when the single-cell zygote is formed, either by fertilization or by cloning. Using the oral contraceptive pill before the first child is born causes a 40-percent increase in the risk of breast cancer. Taken for four or more years before the first child is born increases that risk to 72 percent. The OCP also increases the risk of cancer of the cervix of the uterus and of the liver.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The condom does not provide complete protection from the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infection.<br />
&#160;<br />
Artificial reproductive technologies:<br /><br />
A human being can be brought into existence by the fertilization of an ovum by a sperm. This can be achieved by sexual intercourse or in the laboratory by in vitro fertilization. Reproduction of a human being can also be achieved by cloning. There are many different methods of cloning that include nuclear transfer, embryo splitting, etc.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The Church teaches that IVF and human cloning are morally forbidden. Why? IVF between husband and wife is condemned because it is illicit in itself, and in opposition to the dignity of procreation and the conjugal union. IVF in which the sperm or ovum of a third person is used is also condemned because, in addition, it violates the reciprocal commitment of spouses and shows a grave lack of regard for that essential property of marriage which is unity. It also deprives the child of her or his filial relationship with parental origins, can hinder the maturing of personal identity, can damage personal relationships within the family and has repercussions on civil society.<br />
&#160;<br />
IVF is neither, in fact, achieved nor positively willed as an expression and fruit of a specific act of conjugal union. The human embryo is treated as a product of technology and not as a gift of God. In its use and in the use of many other techniques of genetic engineering, a human person is objectively deprived of his or her proper perfection. Such fertilization establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the person. This domination is contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children. Therefore, IVF and cloning are morally unacceptable.<br />
&#160;<br /><em>Relevant medical facts</em></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">â€¢&#160;Few children conceived by IVF are ever born. In each cycle, six to eight embryos are conceived. At most, two are implanted. The rest are either disposed of immediately or are frozen, and eventually, most die. Only 25 percent of those conceived are implanted, and of them, only 20 percent are born. Therefore, only five percent of IVF embryos are born alive. The Australian bioethicist Nicholas Tonti-Filippini calculates that the chance of saving a given frozen human embryo by implantation is less than two percent.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Birth defects associated with assisted reproductive technologies: 4.9-7.2 fold increase in malignant tumor of the retina; five percent incidence of Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (large tongue, predisposition to cancer); in Brazil, incidence of cancer increased 117 times; cerebral palsy increased 1.4 -1.7 times; fourfold increase in developmental delay; premature birth increased 5.6 times; low birthrate increased 9.8 times and heart deformity increased four times.<br /></font></strong><strong><font size="4">To achieve IVF, a woman is given hormones to stimulate the development of many ova at the same time. This may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and breathing difficulty. In rare cases, blood clots, kidney or lung disease may occur and may be life-threatening.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Dr. Thomas Hilgers Fertility<em>Care</em> System: Dr. Hilgers Natural Procreative Technology is a method of care that involves precise diagnosis of the hormonal caused of infertility, and its appropriate treatment. It is also morally acceptable as a way to help an infertile woman to conceive, and is two to three times more successful than IVF, at a fraction of the cost. One study on women who had previous failed IVF, showed a success rate of 36.2 percent. The Hilgers system has been shown to be up to 80-percent successful in helping women to have a successful pregnancy after they have suffered repeated miscarriages. It cuts the rate of premature birth in half, thus helping to reduce the incidence of brain damage.

That was, I am sad to say, a very long time ago.<br /><br />
Today, there appears to be a slow deterioration in the Catholic identity of Catholic health-care institutions. I started to become aware of this over 10 years ago, when the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1939&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Peoria Protocol</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> first came to my attention. For those unfamiliar with it, the Peoria Protocol, first developed in 1995, was put in place at Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois.&#160;The Protocol defines permissible approaches to medical care following a sexual assault.&#160;Following are two of its four possible courses of action:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">* The woman is determined to be past the early post-ovulatory phase of her cycle if the LH urine test is negative and her progesterone level is greater than or equal to 6 ng/mL. In this situation, the timing of the sexual assault could not have coincided with the presence of an ovum. Hence, it is morally permissible to administer an emergency contraceptive for the victim's psychological benefit. <br /><br />
* Finally, the woman is determined to be in the late post-ovulatory phase if the LH urine test is negative, her progesterone level is less than 6 ng/mL, and she anticipates menstruation in less than seven days. Here, too, it is morally permissible to administer a contraceptive medication.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">These two statements, while approved by many Catholic medical ethicists, represent a fundamental moral problem. If the Catholic Church does not condone the use of contraception as medical treatment in any case other than a situation involving a serious medical condition and in which the female abstains from sexual relations during such treatment, how can it be permissible to administer a powerful chemical compound that is known to abort, when there is no serious medical condition and alternative therapies exist? Neither of the above scenarios described in the Peoria Protocol provide a 100-percent guarantee that a child has not been conceived. Moreover, these statements are nuanced and do not provide adequate safeguards to protect the child, should his conception have occurred as a result of the rape. <br /><br />
One has to wonder why a Catholic hospital would even consider this treatment option. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1929&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Saint Francis Medical Center</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;is also involved in dispensing oral contraceptives. The news media reports that its involvement in the distribution of birth control pills is the direct result of a middle ground decision:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">[W]hen OSF Saint Francis began hiring primary care physicians in the 1990s as part of OSF Medical Group, many of the physicians wanted to prescribe oral contraceptives. Much anguished discussion ensued, said Joseph Piccione, corporate ethicist for OSF Healthcare System.<br /><br />
Yet a middle ground was found. No contraception of any kind would be distributed within the four walls of the hospital itself, Piccione said.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Regardless of walls, there is no Catholic doctrine that would sanction&#160;an arm's-length agreement that the birth control pill can be dispensed under the aegis of the Church.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Then there's the California case involving known abortionists serving as staff physicians for Catholic hospitals.

CHW originally excused their promotion and use of three identified abortion doctors as a matter of an insurance requirement. Following my (Bud) efforts to get clarification from Mr. Gardner, last week he sent me a one sentence email which now claims that federal law requires CHW hospitals to allow the abortion doctors to practice in their hospitals. I wrote back to Mr. Gardner and asking him for a meeting or at least giving us the citations for the laws he refers to. So far nothing but silence from Mr. Gardner. Keep this in prayer.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">It is probably no accident that about a year ago, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1931&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Catholic Healthcare West</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> entered into an alliance with human cloning practitioner Advanced Cell Technology, Inc.&#160; While it is reported that Catholic Healthcare West will be conducting clinical trials of adult stem cell treatment for heart disease, this alliance raises serious ethical questions, due to the fact that ACT has previously promoted research that contradicts Catholic principles regarding respect for the rights of the human embryo.<br /><br />
The problematic nature of such agreements, arrangements and alliances is not by any means limited to Illinois and California. It is a nationwide epidemic, rooted in the age-old dilemma of choosing between God and money. This becomes very clear when revisiting the complexities of the Boston archdiocese's </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1633&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Caritas Christi</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> mess. You may recall that American Life League was quick to commend Cardinal Sean O'Malley when the archdiocese made this announcement on June 26:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Caritas Christi Health Care, the financially challenged Catholic hospital system founded by the Archdiocese of Boston, is abruptly ending its joint venture with a Missouri-based health insurer at the insistence of Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley, who has decided that the relationship represented too much of an entanglement between Catholic hospitals and abortion providers.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">But, within days, we received a telephone call informing us that the agreement had actually not been cancelled. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1938&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Carol McKinley</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> reported this on her blog, which has thus far not been refuted: Nobody (including other bishops and cardinals) is able to get details out of the cardinal about what it is he has approved. I think our Catholic pro-life force deserves to know what the actual arrangement is.<br />
But we do have an inkling when we consider the statement Cardinal </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1935&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">O'Malley</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> made, as quoted in the <em>Boston Globe</em>:&#160;By withdrawing from the joint venture and serving the poor as a provider... upholding Catholic moral teaching at all times, they are able to carry forward the critical mission of Catholic health care. The newspaper's analysis: Because Caritas will no longer be a joint owner of the insurance venture, the archdiocese is hoping that there will no longer be any question that Caritas will not financially profit from abortions, sterilizations, or other services provided by non-Catholic hospitals.â€</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A Caritas spokeswoman told the <em>Globe.</em> This is the right way to move the distraction of the debate of ownership and allow us to be a provider. Here is noted Catholic commentator </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1934&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Phil Lawler</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">â€™s response:&#160;A debate over involvement in killing unborn babies is a distractionâ€™ from the business of saving lives. A debate over mutilating people to make them infertile is a distraction from the distinctive mission of Catholic health care.<br />
So we are left to wonder if all this means is that Caritas Christi is no longer a an official business partner of abortion providers, but still connected with them in some way. Does it mean that Catholic hospitals will continue to refer for abortion, use the morning-after pill to treat rape victims and so forth? Nobody knows!<br /><br />
As I write this, similar problems are developing in New Hampshire, where the pressure is on Catholic hospitals to bend to the will of the state. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1930&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">New Hampshire Right to Life</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> has prepared a set of three videos dealing with the challenges they face at this time.&#160;As was the case in Massachusetts, the cause of concern is a merger.<br /><br />

What also occurs to me is that our bishops must speak with a unified voice, without any dissent and without any bureaucratic mumbo jumbo. They must set forth authentically Catholic medical ethics as the only medical ethics that will be followed&#160;in a Catholic setting”with or without mergers, alliances or â€œcommon-ground shenanigans.

Deisher, Ph.D.</em></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Just when the pharmaceutical industry thought the vaccine-autism controversy had been resolved, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee has recommended further study of vaccine safety. A perceived fear of the safety of the U.S. vaccination schedule has led increasing numbers of parents to opt out of full compliance. The numbers of children who are not fully vaccinated has now reached a point where her immunity may be compromised, compelling the Centers for Disease Control to hold town-hall meetings and convene a Vaccine Safety Working Subgroup. Despite research ruling out mercury (Thimerosal) or the measles portion of one specific vaccine, autism continues to rise to a level of one in every 64 children in the UK. <br /><br />
The NVAC draft report recommends further study of the potential for vaccines to contribute to </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1920&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">autism</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> in children who have underlying mitochondrial disease, a worthwhile study given the clinical history of such children developing autism after vaccinations (see </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1916&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Poling</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> case). What the NVAC has overlooked, however, in their recommendations, is that epidemic regressive autism is associated with the switch from using animal cells to produce vaccines to the use of aborted human fetal cells for vaccine production. Now when we vaccinate our children, some vaccines also deliver contaminating aborted human fetal DNA. The safety of this has never been tested.<br /><br />
Autism and autism spectrum disorder are polygenic diseases, meaning that multiple genes have been shown to be associated with these diseases. Studies have also clearly shown that there is an environmental component, a trigger, that is required. Vaccines are an obvious potential environmental trigger for autism because of the almost universal childhood exposure to vaccines in first world countries. The vaccine-autism connection was first hypothesized following the introduction of a new measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to the U.S. in 1979, with complete U.S. market share by 1983, and to the UK in 1988. Autism rates began to rise in the U.S. after 1979 and rose dramatically after 1983, and likewise rose in the UK after 1988, leading physicians to suspect a link. Initially, the measles component of this vaccine, MMR II, was suspected to be the culprit. Subsequent studies have also focused on the presence of mercury in vaccines, which incidentally, the MMR II vaccine did not contain.<br /><br />
Those studies have largely ruled out the new measles portion of the MMR II or mercury as the environmental trigger for autism. However, the compelling temporal association between this new MMR vaccine and autism cannot be ignored or explained away. What has been ignored is the fact that this new MMR vaccine introduced the use of aborted fetal cells for vaccine production. At one point, as much as 94 percent of children in the U.S. and 98 percent of children in the UK were given this vaccine.<br /><br />
Today, more than 23 vaccines are contaminated by the use of aborted fetal cells. There is no law that requires that consumers be informed that some vaccines are made using aborted fetal cells and contain residual aborted fetal DNA. While newer vaccines produced using aborted fetal cells do inform consumers, in their package inserts, that the vaccines contain contaminating DNA from the cell used to produce the vaccine, they do not identify the cells as being derived from electively aborted human fetuses. (See the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1917&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Varivax</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;chicken pox package insert for the presence of MRC5 residual DNA.)<br /><br />
In other words, they tell you what is in the vaccine, but they don't fully inform you where it came from. The earliest aborted fetal cell-produced vaccines such as Meruvax (rubella) and </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1918&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">MMR</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> II do not even inform consumers that the vaccines contain contaminating DNA from the cell used to produce them.&#160;Furthermore, it is unconscionable that the public-health risk of injecting our children with residual contaminating human aborted fetal DNA has been ignored.<br /><br />
How could the contaminating aborted fetal DNA create problems? It creates the potential for autoimmune responses and/or inappropriate insertion into our own genomes through a process called recombination. There are groups researching the potential link between this DNA and autoimmune diseases such as juvenile (type I) diabetes, multiple sclerosis and lupus. Our organization, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1915&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;is focused on studying the quantity, characteristics and genomic recombination of the aborted fetal DNA found in many of our vaccines.<br /><br />
Preliminary bioinformatics research conducted at SCPI indicates that hot spots for DNA recombination are found in nine autism-associated genes present on the X chromosome. These nine genes are involved in nerve-cell synapse formation, central nervous system development and mitochondrial function.<br /><br />
Could genomic insertion of the aborted fetal DNA, found in some of our childhood vaccines since 1979, be an environmental trigger for autism? Could the fact that genes critical for nerve synapse formation and nervous system development are found on the X chromosome provide some explanation of why autism is predominantly a disease found in boys? Could the hot spots identified in these autism-associated genes be sites for insertion of contaminating aborted fetal DNA?<br /><br />
These questions must be answered, and quickly. Recent literature suggests that autism spectrum disorder may now impact one out of every 100 children. The pharmaceutical industry is also currently moving to replace more animal-produced vaccines with aborted-fetal-cell production and also to produce biologic drugs using aborted fetal cells.<br /><br />
The practice of using aborted fetal cells for vaccine and drug production creates wrenching moral dilemmas for parents and consumers, ignores informed consent rights, and exposes our children and ourselves to contaminants lacking safety evaluations. We cannot ignore this issue in good conscience, and we cannot afford to wait.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Dr. Deisher is president of Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute (</font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1915&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">www.soundchoice.org</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">), as well as a cofounder and the research and development director for Ave Maria Biotechnology Company (</font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1923&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">www.avmbiotech.com</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">), which promote pro-life biotechnology.&#160;This article is an adaptation and update of </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1914&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">â€™s June 2009 newsletter and is published with its kind permission.&#160;For more information on Dr. Deisher, see "Providing real choice: A conversation with Dr. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1921&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Theresa Deisher</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">"&#160;in&#160;American Life League's <em>Celebrate Life</em> magazine (January-February 2009) .</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="5">Pro-Life Today |&#160;20 July 2009</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><u><font color="#ff0000">HEADLINES<br /></font></u></span><br />

Among the hopeful visions and promises of change articulated by Mr. Obama in his inaugural speech this past January was a vow to "restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Six months into his term, a picture of the president's understanding of science and its "rightful place" is emerging, and it is anything but flattering. President Obama has repeatedly demonstrated a propensity to elevate "science" over ethical considerations in pursuit of utilitarian goals. He has shown himself to be all too willing to sacrifice principle, morality and the most vulnerable among us for the sacred "achievements" of social and scientific progress.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">This penchant of the president to disregard the importance of protecting innocent human life should come as no surprise.

One would think that such a role would hold great attraction for President Obama in light of his stated commitment to discussion and debate; yet time and again, Mr. Obama has demonstrated that when it comes to protecting innocent human life, he is unwilling to allow ethical concerns to impede scientific "progress."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Mr. Obama appears to view any "advance" in science as an intrinsic good that is always beneficial to mankind. This is the same mentality that animated the eugenics movement of the early 20th century. In the 21st century, this mentality has given rise to a "disposable man" ethic that dictates that embryonic stem cell research should proceed unencumbered, regardless of its lack of success and regardless of the fact that each tiny embryo dissected in our quest for our improvement or immortality represents the willful destruction of nascent human life.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Obama's disposable man mentality may also be seen in his approach to pregnancy and abortion. His decision to de-fund abstinence education makes it clear that he sees no utility in a principled approach to preventing unplanned pregnancies. Obama apparently believes that the abstinence-only approach is stifling and outdated. Why encourage teens to defer sex until marriage? Their hormones are, after all, raging. Weâ€™ll just provide condoms on the front end, and if that doesnâ€™t do the trick, abortion on the back endâ€”all at taxpayer expense, of course.

And once again, the bishops are silent.<br /><br />
The New York Times reported that in his later moments, Senator Kennedy began attending daily Mass, prayed often, and called for Father Patrick Tarrant moments before his death on Tuesday evening. <br /><br />
“The deaths of untold millions of preborn babies rested on the conscience of Ted Kennedy,” said Judie Brown, president of American Life League. “There is an impending disaster about to take place at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica. Senator Edward Kennedy spent the past 30 years doing all he could to advocate and support the act of procured abortion - including his divorce, remarriage, et cetera -- and yet he continued to call himself Catholic,” stated Brown. “These are public matters, not private.”<br /><br />
“If we are led to assume Kennedy was remorseful of his pro-abortion past and repented, Boston Cardinal Sean O’Malley should make this known to the Catholic faithful clearly – before the media and pro-abortion politicians turn Kennedy’s death and Mass honoring his memory into yet another victory,” said Brown. “If this remains unclear, what will millions of Catholic Americans be led to believe as Obama canonizes Kennedy’s pro-abortion legacy on live television?”<br /><br />
“The truth does not change because of the respect the world is paying to this man.&#160; The Catholic principles which Cardinal Sean O’Malley has sworn to uphold have not disappeared because of Senator Kennedy's death,” continued Brown. “If this funeral Mass proceeds as planned, Sen. Edward Kennedy will have spit one more time on Christ, this time from a casket.” <br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942. <br />

While the White House has now explained&#160;this remark as the president describing opponents of his health care debacle as agitated bed wetters, the truth is sobering”not silly. In fact, Obama's opponents are perhaps a bit more honest than he would like; thus, the insults.<br /><br />
Having said that, the worrying fact is that there&#160;is still an enormous number of well-meaning people, including Catholics, who simply do not want to see the truth about what is and is not contained in the various proposals currently floating around Congress. One example recently came my way via a Facebook comment.<br /><br />
A very sincere Catholic&#160;wrote to me about American Life League's opposition to the "health care reform" plan, even though our concerns stem from the fact that the proposals are based on imposed death as a cost-saving measure. The more I read and reread her earnest viewpoint on the matter, the more I am convinced that far too many Catholic Americans have never heard of the Church's&#160;teachings. Either that, or they do not understand and accept them. Such confusion results from a type of Catholic ignorance which Americans like Obama count on, day in and day out.<br /><br />
I am so concerned about it that I want to share her comments and then provide the reasons why she is fundamentally misguided.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Dear Ms. Brown,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">I am also a Catholic. I do not believe in abortion and have marched many times in the annual March for Life. I have been ridiculed by onlookers but have always stood firm in my beliefs. Nevertheless, I believe President Obama is a good man. I believe if he says he is not in fact planning to fund abortions that his health care package will not fund them. I believe in everything he stands for except this one thing. I know it is a very BIG thing. But I believe in nothing the Republican Party stands for except this one thing. I stand with the Pro-Life Democrats (most of whom are Catholics) because I believe in uplifting the poor, the worker, the homeless and downtrodden. I believe in cleaning up and taking responsibility for our environment and endangered animals. I believe that life is sacred, Ms. Brown, even the lives of the millions already here who, maybe through no fault of their own, maybe through their own fault, need a hand up. I believe if we have a government that can help, that needs to happen if we are to follow the footsteps of Christ as a nation...</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">This should not be a political issue at all, and you, Ms. Brown, should do your work in that way, not involving yourself in politics.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">If, in fact, abortions are funded, you can expose that once the legislation takes effect. I do not believe the president is a liar so I do not believe they will be funded. In any case, it will not cause more abortions to take place than would have taken place otherwise. And it will definitely not be tax dollars that pay for abortions since the dollars the program will run on will not be tax dollars. Anyone who wants to opt out can certainly do that and pay nothing.&#160; B.E.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">My correspondent does not understand that pro-life organizations and spokespeople who maintain their credibility are those who have not and will not align themselves with any political party. The reason for this is simple: Our party, if you will, consists of those who have no voice, either because they are not yet born or are in danger of becoming victims of euthanasia. They are people incapable of defending their right to life. These human beings do not wear a partisan label; they wear only a hope that we will defend them and be their voice.<br /><br />
B.E.'s belief in <em>uplifting the poor, the worker, the homeless and downtrodden </em>is not only a reflection of the Beatitudes, in which we all should believe, but a fundamental mandate for pro-life people, because our commitment to human dignity does not end at birth, nor does it end with imposed death. We are pro-life in every sense and stand with B.E.<br /><br />
When B.E. goes on to express her belief in being responsible for the earth and all that is a part of it, she reflects the stewardship that God has assigned to us. It is indeed our responsibility to respect and care for that which He has created and entrusted to us, His children. In fact, it is what Pope John Paul II described in <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2387&amp;F=H">Centesimus annus</a>&#160;</em>as the foundational characteristic of a just culture:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">All human activity takes place within a culture and interacts with culture. For an adequate formation of a culture, the involvement of the whole man is required, whereby he exercises his creativity, intelligence, and knowledge of the world and of people. Furthermore, he displays his capacity for self-control, personal sacrifice, solidarity and readiness to promote the common good. (Section 51)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">And it is here, at this critical juncture between the individual and his fellow man, that a serious rupture occurs between what is perceived by some as the U.S. president's honorable goals and the reality of what he intends. <br /><br />
There can be no solidarity unless man accepts his moral obligation to defend the weakest in our midst. As anyone who follows American Life League's mission knows, there are countless numbers of preborn children killed daily&#160;by human embryonic stem cell research, early abortion chemicals marketed as contraceptives, as well as surgical and medical abortion. Each of these individual persons is a member&#160;of our human family, and their fate is part of our responsibility if, indeed, we wish to live in a just society.<br /><br />
So, when President </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2394&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;claims, for example, that we who have found abortion in the "health care reform" proposals are â€œbearing false witness&#160;against him, we decry his arrogance. Perhaps B.E. has not seen the fallacy of his public pronouncements, but all one needs to do, really, is examine the legislation, as we at American Life League did in our latest <em>ALL Report</em>, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2386&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obamacare</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">: Abortion's Trojan Horse.&#160;The viewer can read about abortion in at least one of the bills by viewing actual statements from the bill that are exhibited in this video.<br /><br />
Or review the statements of&#160;</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2395&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">ABC News</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> chief medical editor, Dr. Timothy Johnson,&#160;who, among others, says, If you look at the language, it gets complicated. It's not crystal clear whether or not that could happen with a so-called public option, and even with private plans that might be subsidized by the government, maybe abortion would be allowed.<br />
So who is the one deceiving the public? Even though B.E. does not believe that the president is a liar, she needs to examine the factual evidence, not for the purpose of making a pejorative judgment about anyone, but to inform herself so that she understands what is being said versus what is being promoted.<br /><br />
If, as B.E. suggests, we remain silent now and ignore the evils contained in the various "health care reform" bills, it would not be spiritually healthy for any of us, nor would it be politically feasible to go back and fix the problem later! Pro-lifers have heard that argument regarding other pieces of legislation. We have learned from painful experience that, in politics, usually nothing is improved in order to agree with Godâ€™s word. Usually,&#160;revisions result in more evil. The sad history of the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2388&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Hyde Amendment</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;which allegedly bars the use of tax dollars to pay for abortion, is a testimony to such failure.<br /><br />
No, the time to fix the deadly aspects of "health care reform" proposals is now. The time to see that justice is done for one and all is <em>now</em>, not later.<br /><br />
Finally, on a personal note and as one Catholic to another, B.E., let me say that, as Catholics, we know how to reach out to those in danger of dying because they do not have adequate health insurance or because their health care is nonexistent. We know because we learned it from and some of us have witnessed it in the work of Mother Teresa and countless others whose names are not readily known, all of whose work has left a legacy of love. It is called charity! It is the willingness of one community of faithful people to reach out and give of itself for the good of others.<br /><br />
The federal government has never understood charity, and it is not a source of Christ-like care. It is a bloated bureaucracy badly in need of cost-cutting measures, and that is the most fearful of truths when honestly assessing what â€œhealth care reform is actually all about. The American Health Care Association says seniors would face billions of dollars in </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=336&amp;L=2389&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Medicare</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> cuts.&#160;<br /><br />
That does not sound like good news to me! It is a warning and should be uppermost in B.E.'s thoughts and prayers as she continues, as each of us should, to be concerned for the most vulnerable in our midst. <br /><br />
God save us from silly phrases and deadly agendas.</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="5">Associate Newsletter</font></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Volume 6, Number 29&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">August 3,&#160;2009</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">New Associate Groups<br /><br />

In reality, cities cover less than 1% of the earth’s land surface. If you look at a population density map, you find that most square miles of land in the world have less than one family living in them! If you divide the land of the earth into square kilometers, about half have nobody living in them. While large numbers of people believe that some land is more desirable than other land, experience shows that people differ. Millions want, and do, live in desert, mountain, cold, jungle or other climates that others might consider unlivable.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">If everyone were huddled together in a big ball, the ball would be about one half kilometer (1/4 mile) in radius.

In other words, if you had everybody in the world standing in one place, you could put them in about 20% of the area of Jacksonville, Florida, or 10% of the area of Juneau, Alaska, and have room left over. If everybody in the world wanted to lie down on one flat surface with nobody touching anybody else, you could put all in about 650 square miles. In other words, you could put them all inside the city limits of Jacksonville or in any one of several other cities with room left over!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">There are about 6 billion people in the world averaging in weight less than 100 pounds each, so that all together, they weigh about 300 million tons.

From <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">After reading accounts such as those in our previous newsletters, many people ask staff and supporters of STOPP, “Why do you people do this?”&#160; Many, including Planned Parenthood, do not understand what makes us expend this type of effort for no material gain.&#160; They don’t understand what is so bad about Planned Parenthood programs that gets people upset enough to basically give up all of their free time to fight for the demise of these programs.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">We will now take a look at the basic philosophies of Planned Parenthood as they relate to the subjects taught in typical Family Life Education programs.&#160; Our source for determining these philosophies is a book entitled <em>How to Talk with Your Child About Sexuality</em> which was written by Faye Wattleton while she was president of Planned Parenthood (Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., Garden City, New York; copyright 1986 Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.).</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The stated intent of this book (page 5) is to provide parents with information on the subject of sexuality so that these parents can become “the best source” of information for their children.&#160; The book then proceeds to offer information on a variety topics concerning sexuality.&#160; Of particular interest is some of the information provided in Chapter 7, “The Top Seven Questions.”&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">The first two of the “top seven” questions deal with the physical changes of boys and girls during puberty and the wording is, on the whole, informative and accurate.&#160; However, included in this section on puberty is a topic almost always included in Planned Parenthood literature – masturbation.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Wattleton’s book states that the “modern view” of masturbation is that it is a natural and harmless expression of sexuality.&#160; The advice given to parents who see a small child fondling himself for the first time is to use the occurrence as a “teachable moment,” reassuring the child that masturbation is “something practically everyone does because it feels good…and that there’s nothing wrong with it.”&#160; Planned Parenthood also tells parents that “…many boys, at some point in their development, make it a group event with one or more boys.”</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Another of the “top seven questions” deals with discussing intercourse and pregnancy with your children.&#160; The book strongly recommends that these conversations take place with 10 to 12 year olds.&#160; While the book encourages frank discussion of these topics and the parents’ values, it also states that teenagers have the right to make their own decisions on this matter and that parents actually “owe” them certain reassurances if they choose to become promiscuous! </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">It should be noted that Planned Parenthood has a major adversary in this pushing of sex education on young children.&#160; Sigmund Freud contended that the period of life from six to twelve years was, normally, a “sexual latency” period where one usually suppresses sexual interest and develops other important behavioral capabilities.&#160; Freud, in fact, states that an undue dwelling on sexual matters during this time of life would hinder a person’s normal development.&#160; Freud’s concept is so well accepted that Wattleton had to take the time to address it in her book.&#160; On page 52, Wattleton brings up the Freud “latency idea” and then dismisses it in three short paragraphs.&#160; The book describes a “more widely accepted view” that sex education for this age group is okay but does so without citing any scientific studies or giving the name of even one reputable scientist who agrees.&#160; It obviously doesn’t fit their philosophy, so they dismiss it.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">On the other side of the issue, psychologist Melvin Anchell wrote in a 1986 edition of <em>National Review</em> of the accuracy of Freud’s “latency period” and goes so far to say that today’s sex education programs for the young are DIAGRAMS FOR DISASTER!&#160; And which one of us, after viewing the state of our nation following years of this garbage in our schools, would disagree?</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3">Next month:&#160; Planned Parenthood philosophies continued.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="3"><em>Unborn child's memory develops by 30 weeks in the womb: New research<br /></em>30-week-old babies in the womb already have short-term memory capabilities, a new study from the Netherlands, published in the July/August 2009 issue of the journal <em>Child Development</em>, has found.&#160; The scientists found that at thirty weeks, the child in the womb has a short-term memory of about ten minutes.

Baby Steps joins the ALL Associate Program which has grown, in the past five years, from just 29 to 100 (and counting!) groups in over half of the states in the nation, plus associated groups in Canada and Africa.<br /><br />
“As the personhood movement gains momentum around the country, more and more grassroots organizations are ready to fight for human rights for all human beings,” said Judie Brown, president of American Life League. “After 36 years of legalized murder in this country, the grassroots are shouting, ‘No more!’ And ALL’s Associate Program provides a community dedicated to the same mission – personhood.”<br /><br />
The new group, Baby Steps, based in Carbondale, Co., one of the most pro-abortion areas of the state, is a collaboration between members of two Roman Catholic parishes – St. Vincent and St. Mary of the Crown. The group is dedicated to supporting personhood through the needs of men and women in crisis pregnancies with everyday help, prayer, education and activism.<br /><br />
“Our goal is to teach personhood,” said Bonnie Kowar, co-founder of Baby Steps.&#160; “Our feeling is that once the Holy Spirit helps create the understanding of personhood in one’s heart, the rest of the truths will follow.”<br /><br />
“Real cultural change happens and lives are saved at the grassroots level,” Brown said. “We are so excited to work with Baby Steps and our 99 other Associates working around the clock to defeat what Pope John Paul II named the culture of death.”<br /><br />
According to Fr. Saenz, chaplain of Baby Steps, this new collaboration means their best efforts are yet to come.&#160; “American Life League is the nation’s premier organization working to end abortion and establish a true Culture of Life in our country. We are excited to join their nationwide family and look forward to working with them for a very long time to come,” said Fr. Saenz.<br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942. <br />

There is, rather, an already existing embryo.&#160;But, the "pre-embryo" has been institutionalized, so "stage two" of this sort of verbal deception begins by substituting other false "science" in its place – or simply leaving out legitimate early phases of human embryonic development as if they didn't exist. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">"<em>Pre-embryo Substitutes</em>" </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">One example of this is to claim that the "zygote" is the beginning of when a human being begins to exist. But this would render the human being already existing before the formation of the "zygote" non-existent.&#160; By claiming he or she is neither a human being nor a human person, it can be used simply as "biological material", especially in human genetic engineering research, etc. This "biological entity" is often referred to in the literature as a "pre-zygote" - that is, what is there from the beginning of fertilization up to the formation of the zygote is not a human embryo or a human being. It is just a human "cell.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">However, the Carnegie Stages of Early Human Embryonic Development make it clear that the "zygote" formed at the end of the process of fertilization is not when a new human being begins to exist. Before that, the developing embryo (in Stage 1 of the Carnegie Stages) begins with "first contact" of the sperm with the oocyte, followed by, respectively, the phases of development referred to as "the penetrated oocyte" and the "ootid."&#160; In other words, the new human embryo begins to exist at first contact, at the beginning of the process of fertilization. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Another example of leaving out specific stages of early human embryonic development can be found in several definitions in laws and regulations. A classic example are the formal definitions of "fetus" and "pregnancy" in federal guidelines for the use of human subjects in research as both "beginning at implantation". [A]ll women (rather than just those undergoing IVF or ART) become pregnant only at implantation; before that they are not "pregnant" [and therefore, the use of abortifacients, embryo flushing, prenatal genetic diagnosis, as well as all manner of human embryo research, are "ethical"].</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Or, one can add to specific stages of early human embryonic development. Look at a more recent example:</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">"Embryos are no different in their essential humanity from a fetus in the womb, a 10-year old boy, or a 100-year old woman. At every stage of development, human beings (whether zygote, blastocyst, embryo, fetus, infant, adolescent or adult) retain their identity as an enduring being that grows toward its subsequent stage(s); embryos are integral beings structured for maturation along their proper time line." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The order of scientific terms that should inclusively mean the embryo at all of its various early stages is shifted. Listing the term "embryo" after them, as if what came before was not an embryo, makes the embryo during those earliest of phases of development essentially disappear. Thus we have this following subtle but spurious "pre-embryo substitute" which for all the world sounds very prolife.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">To the casual observer, by adding the term "embryo" after the terms "zygote" and "blastocyst" - followed by "fetus", "infant", etc. -- it would appear that the "zygote" and the "blastocyst" are something other than an "embryo" when, in fact, these are early stages of embryonic development. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Again, one can make a "pre-embryo substitute" by articulating only one kind of human reproduction. For example, one can claim that all human beings begin to exist at "fertilization" or at "conception". But by definition, that makes all human beings reproduced asexually disappear.<br />
&#160;<br />
Perhaps the most daring, and most successful, "pre-embryo substitute" was concocted by human cloning and human embryonic stem cell researchers Irving Weissman, Michael West, et al. For these researchers, the immediate product of both sexual and asexual human reproduction is "just a cell" - not a human being, not a human organism, not a human embryo. And the "blastocyst" from which "stem cells" are derived is simply "a ball of cells." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">These researchers also concocted another way to get rid of the human embryo - in fact, they got rid of the human embryo and the human fetus - by making a false distinction between "therapeutic" and "reproductive" cloning. They claimed that the product of "therapeutic cloning" was just a bunch of cells; the product of "reproductive cloning" was a human being - but not until it was born! They also enjoyed defining "cloning" only in terms of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) - thus making all of the other dozens of kinds of human cloning techniques disappear. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Indeed, such "pre-embryos" and "pre-embryo substitutes" as noted above are particularly useful in laws and regulations involving the early human embryo, because often such innovative and imaginative but false scientific terms used in legal definitions are legally "exclusionary" - and thus create useful legal loopholes. It's enough to make our collective heads spin! </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Correct Formation of Conscience</em> </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">As noted, the abuse of language concerning the early human embryo is an ongoing concern; ever new, inventive and imaginative "pre-embryo substitutes" appear almost on a daily basis. This is why it is important to be aware of and acknowledge the long-established and documented empirical facts of human embryology.<br />

As Pope John Paul II warned, <br /><br />
“The end result of this is tragic: not only is the fact of the destruction of so many human lives still to be born or in their final stage extremely grave and disturbing, but no less grave and disturbing is the fact that conscience itself, darkened as it were by such widespread conditioning, is finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between good and evil in what concerns the basic value of human life... </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">“...[W]e need now more than ever to have the courage to look the truth in the eye and to call things by their proper name, without yielding to convenient compromises or to the temptation of self-deception...

But no word has the power to change the reality of things.”&#160; (Pope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium Vitae,</em> 1995, Sections&#160;4 and 58). </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Consuming secondhand steroids<br /></em>[F]ew in the general public are aware that oral contraceptives ("the Pill"), levonorgestrel ("the morning-after pill"), and mifepristone, or RU-486 ("the abortion pill"), are also all steroids.

Indeed, especially over the last 40 years or so, the value of human life has diminished steadily and rapidly – especially with regard to its "beginning.” Yet, even aside from the important and significant "personhood" debates, the Church has consistently taught that the mere fact that there is a living innocent human being before us is sufficient to safeguard the life of that human being even at its very beginning. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">But precisely when is "the first moment of its existence"?</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Without doubt, the abuse of language, especially scientific "language," has shrouded clear facts about precisely when the "first moment of its existence is," and has hastened this drastic decline in the respect for human life. This linguistic abuse has been both purposeful as well as naively equivocal. That is, it is not just because of the willful and devious use of language by ardent supporters of [the culture of death], but also because even many of those who are dedicated to this "safeguarding" themselves fall victim to the use of erroneous "scientific" terms. The result is an amazingly long list over the decades of what I have often referred to as "pre-embryo substitutes." </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Given that this linguistic phenomenon continues unabated as we speak, it might be of help to remind ourselves of how very subtly these linguistic twists can come about so that we can be more sensitive to identifying them. Generally speaking, there are a number of ways that the misuse of simple scientific "language" can slip into our rhetoric and our thinking processes without notice. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The 'Pre-Embryo'</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">First, it is to be noted historically that the authors of the now officially rejected false scientific term "pre-embryo" were a Catholic Jesuit priest and a Catholic frog biologist – Fr. Richard McCormick and Clifford Grobstein. According to them, there is an important scientific and moral distinction to be made between a "human being" and a "human person." That is, they agreed that the immediate product of fertilization was a human being (a "genetic individual"), but before 14-days it was not yet a human person (a "developmental individual") with a rational soul, and thus with the same ethical and legal rights and protections as all other human persons. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Before 14-days there was just a "pre-embryo," a "non-person," and although it should be "respected," it is still ethical to kill this "pre-embryo" for proportionate reasons. Of course, this "distinction" of McCormick and Grobstein between a "human being" and a "human person" is a false distinction, a "distinction" without a real difference. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">This false pseudo-scientific term "pre-embryo," and its accompanying false term "individuality," was finally, formally rejected by the international nomenclature committee in human embryology. That committee made it clear that, at fertilization (sexual human reproduction), the "embryo" begins to exist immediately. Thus, scientifically, there is no such thing as a "pre-embryo" that exists after fertilization and before 14-days. There is, rather, an already existing embryo. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">However, the "pre-embryo" had already been institutionalized by then (even around the world), and many on both sides of the aisle were not happy with this formal scientific refutation of their supra-useful linguistic invention. For those who wanted to pursue IVF, abortion, research, etc., they would have to come up with some other false scientific terms to scientifically "justify" what they wanted to do. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">And thus began "stage two" of this sort of verbal deception required to "scientifically" justify all manner of projects with the early human embryo. This "stage" I have often referred to as consisting of "pre-embryo substitutes." That is, the term "pre-embryo" must now necessarily be dropped, but the same agenda could be accomplished by substituting other false "science" in its place, or simply leaving out legitimate early phases of human embryonic development as if they didn't exist. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Next week:&#160; Part 2 – “Pre-embryo substitutes”<br /></font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Generic Plan B pregnancy prevention approved for teens<br /></em>A generic version of the morning-after-pill known as Plan B has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for prescription use by women aged 17 and under.

“Planned Parenthood and the birth control industry would have you believe Plan B One-Step cannot cause an abortion. That is a lie.<br /><br />
“In 1965, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a Terminology Bulletin that ‘officially’ changed the definition of “conception” from the union of sperm and egg to implantation. As a result, the medical establishment does not call the killing of a human being prior to implantation an abortion. But that is just semantics.<br /><br />
“Plan B One-Step works like any other abortifacient drug: It can alter (thin) the lining (endometrium) of the mother’s uterus so that the newly-formed baby cannot implant and thus dies. Plan B One-Step’s product information itself states, “It may inhibit implantation (by altering the endometrium).” Direct abortion is the willful ending of a preborn human being’s life. Plan B One-Step is thus a direct abortion method. Women should not allow themselves to be misled by sales representatives for Plan B and Plan B One-Step, who claim that these products will not terminate an existing pregnancy.<br /><br />
“Unfortunately, the birth control industry and Planned Parenthood – the nation’s largest abortion chain – have tricked many women into aborting their tiny children. Plan B One-Step, Plan B, the birth control pill, IUD and other hormonal birth control products can all cause abortions. Period.<br /><br />
“So, the next time you hear that Plan B or Plan B One-Step cannot cause an abortion, you will know the truth. Plan B products kill.”<br /><br />

“Laws, Lies and Videotape” is currently available on American Life League’s home page, www.all.org&lt;http://www.all.org/&gt; and on YouTube under the same title.<br /><br />

&#160;<br />
Take, for instance, this quote by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1661&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Elisabeth Garber-Paul</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> in an article&#160;on the rise in sexual activity during this economic recession: So join the rest of America in this exciting new trend. Save money, stay in, have sexjust don't make a baby.<br />
&#160;<br />
That's right, Elisabeth, throw respect for yourself out the window and spit in the face of God by removing one of his intentions for intercourse. More babies will just make the economy worse, right? Wrong. In fact, one of the reasons we are even in this recession is because of the plummeting birthrate. There simply aren't enough people to replace the retiring population in the workplace and pay for Social Security, or to stimulate the economy. <br />
&#160;<br />
Not that you'll hear about that&#160;from the anti-human, overpopulation zealots. But do your research. Watch&#160;<em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1674&amp;F=H">Demographic Winter&#160;</a></em> and&#160;<u><em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1674&amp;F=H">Demographic Bomb</a></em></u><em>,</em> two documentaries which debunk the overpopulation myth and ask a very important question: Is it possible we have been failed by the very ideas we thought could save us?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">It goes without saying that abortion advocates think saving sex for marriage is ludicrous and archaic. Just check out the title of a book just released by radical feminist </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1662&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Jessica Valenti</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">: <em>The Purity Myth: How America's Obsession with Virginity is Hurting Young Women</em>.&#160;<br /><br />
In an interview on the rabidly pro-abortion RH Reality Check&#160;web site, Valenti purports that teaching and honoring purity is just as dangerous as the media's pressure on sexuality and the hypersexualization of women. Oh, really? So, protecting young people from the heartbreak and emptiness of premarital sex, not to mention a load of sexually transmitted diseases, is akin to the objectification of women, the result of which has been a generation of depressed, confused girls with eating disorders?<br /><br />
She goes on to say.&#160; The purity myth is so embedded in our culture and our psyche. &#160;You don't have to be forcing your daughter to take a virginity pledge in order for the fiction of virginity to affect your life. Really? Then why does every Hollywood film end (or begin) with a couple jumping into bed together? If it's so embedded in our culture, then why are abortion, STD and teen pregnancy rates so high? (I'm not going to even legitimize her term fiction of virginity with a response).<br /><br />
As if that isn't enough, in Greensboro, North Carolina, a new program is paying high school girls <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> to get pregnant. That's right. For every day they stay baby-free, $1 is deposited into an account to be used for college. According to a local TV news report, the group was founded by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1624&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Hazel Brown</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;â€œa maternity nurse who thought too many teens were having babies.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Ms. Brown, how about seeing the root of the problem? <em>Too many teens are having premarital sex</em>. The problem is not the presence of a baby, but the actions of his mother and father, which resulted in his existence. <br /><br />
The three goals of this program, called </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=277&amp;L=1964&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">College Bound Sisters</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;are for the girls to â€œavoid pregnancy, graduate from high school and enroll in college, Brown said. Oh, what lofty goals we have for our young people!<br /><br />
Teenagers rise to the expectations that are set for them. If all we ask is that they avoid pregnancy (and we'll even pay them for that!), what are we teaching girls about sex, relationships, the value of children or personal responsibility, for that matter?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Instead of urging purity and self-control, and demonstrating the joys of a quiver full of children (Psalm 127:3-5) within marriage, this program bribes young girls. If those same girls were taught basic biblical morality, they wouldnâ€™t be having sex, and thus, there would be no chance of pregnancy.<br /><br />
The message of this program in a nutshell: Go ahead and sin against God by having damaging premarital sex, but just make sure you avoid one of the outcomes: babies. <br /><br />
If only young people knew the joy and blessings they are missing out on when they use sex for purely physical and selfish reasons! Then, and only then, would they cherish chastity as it should be cherished. <br /><br />
To my single friends reading this, please flee from this deadly mentality of me-first, pleasure-seeking sex without consequences. Seek righteousness, pursue holiness and practice chastity.&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
But understand this: There will be terrifying times in the last days. People will be self-centered and lovers of money, proud, haughty, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, irreligious, callous, implacable, slanderous, licentious, brutal, hating what is good, traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, as they make a pretense of religion but deny its power.

By John B. Shea, M.D., FRCP(C)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Contraception:<br /><br />
The Catholic Church teaches that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun, and, above all, directly willed and procured abortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are absolutely excluded as licit means of regulating birth. Equally excluded â€¦ is direct sterilization, whether perpetual or temporary, whether of the man or the woman. This teaching prohibits contraception by means of the condom, intrauterine device, vasectomy, tubal ligation and chemical contraception by the use of oral contraceptives, morning-after pills, or the administration of contraceptives by injection or in a skin patch. The reason for this prohibition is that contraception breaks the inseparable connection, willed by God and unable to be broken by man on his own initiative, between the unitive meaning and the procreative meaning of the conjugal act.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Contraception greatly dishonors marriage, the greatness of which is beautifully described by Dietrich von Hildebrand. No natural human good has been exalted so high in the New Testament. No other good has been chosen to become one of the Seven Sacraments. No other has been endowed with the honor of participating in the establishment of the Kingdom of God. The wonderful, divinely appointed relationship between the mysterious procreation of a new human being, and this most intimate communion of love&#160; illuminates the grandeur and solemnity of this union. Thus it is that in order to preserve the reverent attitude of the spouses toward the mystery of this union, this general connection between procreation and the communion of love must always be maintained.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">History has clearly demonstrated how prescient Pope Paul VI (1963-1978) was when he predicted that the practice of contraception would cause the man to lose respect for the woman, considering her a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment. The gigantic increase in the incidence of abortion and of sexually transmitted infections bears witness to the promiscuity that followed the legalization and wide availability of chemical contraceptives. The pope also warned of the danger that public authorities which take no heed of moral exigencies would try to solve problems of the community by means illicit for married couples. Witness the worldwide promotion of contraception and abortion fostered by the United Nations today, and also the mandatory one-child policy of the government of China.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Paul VI, in <em>Humanae vitae</em>, stated that if, then, there are serious motives to space out births, which derive from the physical or psychological conditions of husband and wife, or from external conditions, the Church teaches that it is then licit to take into account the natural rhythms immanent in the generative functions, for the use of marriage in the infecund periods only, and in this way to regulate births without offending the moral principles which have been recalled earlier.&#160; Pius XII taught that unless some serious circumstances arise, spouses are obliged to have children. However, he also teaches that it is moral for the spouses to limit their family size or even to refrain from having children altogether, if they have sufficiently serious reasons. He stated that â€œthere are serious motives, such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic, and social indications, that can except for a long time, perhaps even during the whole duration of the marriage, from the positive and obligatory carrying out of the act.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The 1965 Vatican document <em>The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World </em>(<em>Gaudium et spes</em>) teaches that â€œamong the married couples who thus fulfill their God-given mission, special mention should be made of those who after prudent reflection and common decisions, courageously undertake the proper upbringing of a large number of children. It also states that it is the duty of the parents, and of them alone, to decide on the number and spacing of children, and that they should take into consideration their own good and the good of their children already born or yet to come, and ability to read the signs of the times and of their own situation, on the material and spiritual level, and finally, an estimation of the good of the family, of society, and of the Church.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The morally acceptable way for spacing the birth of children is called â€œNatural Family Planning. One of the best methods is the Hilgers system. The effectiveness rates of this method for avoiding pregnancy have been shown to be 99.5 to 98.8 at the twelfth month of use. This compares favorably to the pill, of which Planned Parenthood's web site states, Of 100 women who use the Pill, only 8 will become pregnant during the first year of typical use.</font></strong></p><p><em><strong><font size="4">Relevant medical facts</font></strong></em></p><p><strong><font size="4">Some chemical contraceptives abort <em>all</em> of the time. All of them abort <em>some</em> of the time. They do this by preventing implantation of an embryo in the uterus.&#160; Elites in the medical profession try to justify their use of the word â€œcontraceptive by stating that there is no embryo before implantation. This statement is false. The science of human embryology demonstrated, over 100 years ago, that a new individual human being comes into existence when the single-cell zygote is formed, either by fertilization or by cloning. Using the oral contraceptive pill before the first child is born causes a 40-percent increase in the risk of breast cancer. Taken for four or more years before the first child is born increases that risk to 72 percent. The OCP also increases the risk of cancer of the cervix of the uterus and of the liver.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The condom does not provide complete protection from the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infection.<br />
&#160;<br />
Artificial reproductive technologies:<br /><br />
A human being can be brought into existence by the fertilization of an ovum by a sperm. This can be achieved by sexual intercourse or in the laboratory by in vitro fertilization. Reproduction of a human being can also be achieved by cloning. There are many different methods of cloning that include nuclear transfer, embryo splitting, etc.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The Church teaches that IVF and human cloning are morally forbidden. Why? IVF between husband and wife is condemned because it is illicit in itself, and in opposition to the dignity of procreation and the conjugal union. IVF in which the sperm or ovum of a third person is used is also condemned because, in addition, it violates the reciprocal commitment of spouses and shows a grave lack of regard for that essential property of marriage which is unity. It also deprives the child of her or his filial relationship with parental origins, can hinder the maturing of personal identity, can damage personal relationships within the family and has repercussions on civil society.<br />
&#160;<br />
IVF is neither, in fact, achieved nor positively willed as an expression and fruit of a specific act of conjugal union. The human embryo is treated as a product of technology and not as a gift of God. In its use and in the use of many other techniques of genetic engineering, a human person is objectively deprived of his or her proper perfection. Such fertilization establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the person. This domination is contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children. Therefore, IVF and cloning are morally unacceptable.<br />
&#160;<br /><em>Relevant medical facts</em></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">â€¢&#160;Few children conceived by IVF are ever born. In each cycle, six to eight embryos are conceived. At most, two are implanted. The rest are either disposed of immediately or are frozen, and eventually, most die. Only 25 percent of those conceived are implanted, and of them, only 20 percent are born. Therefore, only five percent of IVF embryos are born alive. The Australian bioethicist Nicholas Tonti-Filippini calculates that the chance of saving a given frozen human embryo by implantation is less than two percent.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Birth defects associated with assisted reproductive technologies: 4.9-7.2 fold increase in malignant tumor of the retina; five percent incidence of Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (large tongue, predisposition to cancer); in Brazil, incidence of cancer increased 117 times; cerebral palsy increased 1.4 -1.7 times; fourfold increase in developmental delay; premature birth increased 5.6 times; low birthrate increased 9.8 times and heart deformity increased four times.<br /></font></strong><strong><font size="4">To achieve IVF, a woman is given hormones to stimulate the development of many ova at the same time. This may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and breathing difficulty. In rare cases, blood clots, kidney or lung disease may occur and may be life-threatening.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Dr. Thomas Hilgers Fertility<em>Care</em> System: Dr. Hilgers Natural Procreative Technology is a method of care that involves precise diagnosis of the hormonal caused of infertility, and its appropriate treatment. It is also morally acceptable as a way to help an infertile woman to conceive, and is two to three times more successful than IVF, at a fraction of the cost. One study on women who had previous failed IVF, showed a success rate of 36.2 percent. The Hilgers system has been shown to be up to 80-percent successful in helping women to have a successful pregnancy after they have suffered repeated miscarriages. It cuts the rate of premature birth in half, thus helping to reduce the incidence of brain damage.

That was, I am sad to say, a very long time ago.<br /><br />
Today, there appears to be a slow deterioration in the Catholic identity of Catholic health-care institutions. I started to become aware of this over 10 years ago, when the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1939&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Peoria Protocol</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> first came to my attention. For those unfamiliar with it, the Peoria Protocol, first developed in 1995, was put in place at Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois.&#160;The Protocol defines permissible approaches to medical care following a sexual assault.&#160;Following are two of its four possible courses of action:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">* The woman is determined to be past the early post-ovulatory phase of her cycle if the LH urine test is negative and her progesterone level is greater than or equal to 6 ng/mL. In this situation, the timing of the sexual assault could not have coincided with the presence of an ovum. Hence, it is morally permissible to administer an emergency contraceptive for the victim's psychological benefit. <br /><br />
* Finally, the woman is determined to be in the late post-ovulatory phase if the LH urine test is negative, her progesterone level is less than 6 ng/mL, and she anticipates menstruation in less than seven days. Here, too, it is morally permissible to administer a contraceptive medication.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">These two statements, while approved by many Catholic medical ethicists, represent a fundamental moral problem. If the Catholic Church does not condone the use of contraception as medical treatment in any case other than a situation involving a serious medical condition and in which the female abstains from sexual relations during such treatment, how can it be permissible to administer a powerful chemical compound that is known to abort, when there is no serious medical condition and alternative therapies exist? Neither of the above scenarios described in the Peoria Protocol provide a 100-percent guarantee that a child has not been conceived. Moreover, these statements are nuanced and do not provide adequate safeguards to protect the child, should his conception have occurred as a result of the rape. <br /><br />
One has to wonder why a Catholic hospital would even consider this treatment option. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1929&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Saint Francis Medical Center</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;is also involved in dispensing oral contraceptives. The news media reports that its involvement in the distribution of birth control pills is the direct result of a middle ground decision:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">[W]hen OSF Saint Francis began hiring primary care physicians in the 1990s as part of OSF Medical Group, many of the physicians wanted to prescribe oral contraceptives. Much anguished discussion ensued, said Joseph Piccione, corporate ethicist for OSF Healthcare System.<br /><br />
Yet a middle ground was found. No contraception of any kind would be distributed within the four walls of the hospital itself, Piccione said.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Regardless of walls, there is no Catholic doctrine that would sanction&#160;an arm's-length agreement that the birth control pill can be dispensed under the aegis of the Church.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Then there's the California case involving known abortionists serving as staff physicians for Catholic hospitals.

CHW originally excused their promotion and use of three identified abortion doctors as a matter of an insurance requirement. Following my (Bud) efforts to get clarification from Mr. Gardner, last week he sent me a one sentence email which now claims that federal law requires CHW hospitals to allow the abortion doctors to practice in their hospitals. I wrote back to Mr. Gardner and asking him for a meeting or at least giving us the citations for the laws he refers to. So far nothing but silence from Mr. Gardner. Keep this in prayer.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">It is probably no accident that about a year ago, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1931&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Catholic Healthcare West</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> entered into an alliance with human cloning practitioner Advanced Cell Technology, Inc.&#160; While it is reported that Catholic Healthcare West will be conducting clinical trials of adult stem cell treatment for heart disease, this alliance raises serious ethical questions, due to the fact that ACT has previously promoted research that contradicts Catholic principles regarding respect for the rights of the human embryo.<br /><br />
The problematic nature of such agreements, arrangements and alliances is not by any means limited to Illinois and California. It is a nationwide epidemic, rooted in the age-old dilemma of choosing between God and money. This becomes very clear when revisiting the complexities of the Boston archdiocese's </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1633&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Caritas Christi</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> mess. You may recall that American Life League was quick to commend Cardinal Sean O'Malley when the archdiocese made this announcement on June 26:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Caritas Christi Health Care, the financially challenged Catholic hospital system founded by the Archdiocese of Boston, is abruptly ending its joint venture with a Missouri-based health insurer at the insistence of Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley, who has decided that the relationship represented too much of an entanglement between Catholic hospitals and abortion providers.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">But, within days, we received a telephone call informing us that the agreement had actually not been cancelled. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1938&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Carol McKinley</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> reported this on her blog, which has thus far not been refuted: Nobody (including other bishops and cardinals) is able to get details out of the cardinal about what it is he has approved. I think our Catholic pro-life force deserves to know what the actual arrangement is.<br />
But we do have an inkling when we consider the statement Cardinal </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1935&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">O'Malley</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> made, as quoted in the <em>Boston Globe</em>:&#160;By withdrawing from the joint venture and serving the poor as a provider... upholding Catholic moral teaching at all times, they are able to carry forward the critical mission of Catholic health care. The newspaper's analysis: Because Caritas will no longer be a joint owner of the insurance venture, the archdiocese is hoping that there will no longer be any question that Caritas will not financially profit from abortions, sterilizations, or other services provided by non-Catholic hospitals.â€</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">A Caritas spokeswoman told the <em>Globe.</em> This is the right way to move the distraction of the debate of ownership and allow us to be a provider. Here is noted Catholic commentator </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1934&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Phil Lawler</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">â€™s response:&#160;A debate over involvement in killing unborn babies is a distractionâ€™ from the business of saving lives. A debate over mutilating people to make them infertile is a distraction from the distinctive mission of Catholic health care.<br />
So we are left to wonder if all this means is that Caritas Christi is no longer a an official business partner of abortion providers, but still connected with them in some way. Does it mean that Catholic hospitals will continue to refer for abortion, use the morning-after pill to treat rape victims and so forth? Nobody knows!<br /><br />
As I write this, similar problems are developing in New Hampshire, where the pressure is on Catholic hospitals to bend to the will of the state. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=269&amp;L=1930&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">New Hampshire Right to Life</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> has prepared a set of three videos dealing with the challenges they face at this time.&#160;As was the case in Massachusetts, the cause of concern is a merger.<br /><br />

What also occurs to me is that our bishops must speak with a unified voice, without any dissent and without any bureaucratic mumbo jumbo. They must set forth authentically Catholic medical ethics as the only medical ethics that will be followed&#160;in a Catholic setting”with or without mergers, alliances or â€œcommon-ground shenanigans.

Deisher, Ph.D.</em></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Just when the pharmaceutical industry thought the vaccine-autism controversy had been resolved, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee has recommended further study of vaccine safety. A perceived fear of the safety of the U.S. vaccination schedule has led increasing numbers of parents to opt out of full compliance. The numbers of children who are not fully vaccinated has now reached a point where her immunity may be compromised, compelling the Centers for Disease Control to hold town-hall meetings and convene a Vaccine Safety Working Subgroup. Despite research ruling out mercury (Thimerosal) or the measles portion of one specific vaccine, autism continues to rise to a level of one in every 64 children in the UK. <br /><br />
The NVAC draft report recommends further study of the potential for vaccines to contribute to </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1920&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">autism</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> in children who have underlying mitochondrial disease, a worthwhile study given the clinical history of such children developing autism after vaccinations (see </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1916&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Poling</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> case). What the NVAC has overlooked, however, in their recommendations, is that epidemic regressive autism is associated with the switch from using animal cells to produce vaccines to the use of aborted human fetal cells for vaccine production. Now when we vaccinate our children, some vaccines also deliver contaminating aborted human fetal DNA. The safety of this has never been tested.<br /><br />
Autism and autism spectrum disorder are polygenic diseases, meaning that multiple genes have been shown to be associated with these diseases. Studies have also clearly shown that there is an environmental component, a trigger, that is required. Vaccines are an obvious potential environmental trigger for autism because of the almost universal childhood exposure to vaccines in first world countries. The vaccine-autism connection was first hypothesized following the introduction of a new measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to the U.S. in 1979, with complete U.S. market share by 1983, and to the UK in 1988. Autism rates began to rise in the U.S. after 1979 and rose dramatically after 1983, and likewise rose in the UK after 1988, leading physicians to suspect a link. Initially, the measles component of this vaccine, MMR II, was suspected to be the culprit. Subsequent studies have also focused on the presence of mercury in vaccines, which incidentally, the MMR II vaccine did not contain.<br /><br />
Those studies have largely ruled out the new measles portion of the MMR II or mercury as the environmental trigger for autism. However, the compelling temporal association between this new MMR vaccine and autism cannot be ignored or explained away. What has been ignored is the fact that this new MMR vaccine introduced the use of aborted fetal cells for vaccine production. At one point, as much as 94 percent of children in the U.S. and 98 percent of children in the UK were given this vaccine.<br /><br />
Today, more than 23 vaccines are contaminated by the use of aborted fetal cells. There is no law that requires that consumers be informed that some vaccines are made using aborted fetal cells and contain residual aborted fetal DNA. While newer vaccines produced using aborted fetal cells do inform consumers, in their package inserts, that the vaccines contain contaminating DNA from the cell used to produce the vaccine, they do not identify the cells as being derived from electively aborted human fetuses. (See the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1917&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Varivax</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;chicken pox package insert for the presence of MRC5 residual DNA.)<br /><br />
In other words, they tell you what is in the vaccine, but they don't fully inform you where it came from. The earliest aborted fetal cell-produced vaccines such as Meruvax (rubella) and </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1918&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">MMR</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> II do not even inform consumers that the vaccines contain contaminating DNA from the cell used to produce them.&#160;Furthermore, it is unconscionable that the public-health risk of injecting our children with residual contaminating human aborted fetal DNA has been ignored.<br /><br />
How could the contaminating aborted fetal DNA create problems? It creates the potential for autoimmune responses and/or inappropriate insertion into our own genomes through a process called recombination. There are groups researching the potential link between this DNA and autoimmune diseases such as juvenile (type I) diabetes, multiple sclerosis and lupus. Our organization, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1915&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;is focused on studying the quantity, characteristics and genomic recombination of the aborted fetal DNA found in many of our vaccines.<br /><br />
Preliminary bioinformatics research conducted at SCPI indicates that hot spots for DNA recombination are found in nine autism-associated genes present on the X chromosome. These nine genes are involved in nerve-cell synapse formation, central nervous system development and mitochondrial function.<br /><br />
Could genomic insertion of the aborted fetal DNA, found in some of our childhood vaccines since 1979, be an environmental trigger for autism? Could the fact that genes critical for nerve synapse formation and nervous system development are found on the X chromosome provide some explanation of why autism is predominantly a disease found in boys? Could the hot spots identified in these autism-associated genes be sites for insertion of contaminating aborted fetal DNA?<br /><br />
These questions must be answered, and quickly. Recent literature suggests that autism spectrum disorder may now impact one out of every 100 children. The pharmaceutical industry is also currently moving to replace more animal-produced vaccines with aborted-fetal-cell production and also to produce biologic drugs using aborted fetal cells.<br /><br />
The practice of using aborted fetal cells for vaccine and drug production creates wrenching moral dilemmas for parents and consumers, ignores informed consent rights, and exposes our children and ourselves to contaminants lacking safety evaluations. We cannot ignore this issue in good conscience, and we cannot afford to wait.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Dr. Deisher is president of Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute (</font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1915&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">www.soundchoice.org</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">), as well as a cofounder and the research and development director for Ave Maria Biotechnology Company (</font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1923&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">www.avmbiotech.com</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">), which promote pro-life biotechnology.&#160;This article is an adaptation and update of </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1914&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">â€™s June 2009 newsletter and is published with its kind permission.&#160;For more information on Dr. Deisher, see "Providing real choice: A conversation with Dr. </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=268&amp;L=1921&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Theresa Deisher</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">"&#160;in&#160;American Life League's <em>Celebrate Life</em> magazine (January-February 2009) .</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="5">Pro-Life Today |&#160;20 July 2009</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><u><font color="#ff0000">HEADLINES<br /></font></u></span><br />

Among the hopeful visions and promises of change articulated by Mr. Obama in his inaugural speech this past January was a vow to "restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Six months into his term, a picture of the president's understanding of science and its "rightful place" is emerging, and it is anything but flattering. President Obama has repeatedly demonstrated a propensity to elevate "science" over ethical considerations in pursuit of utilitarian goals. He has shown himself to be all too willing to sacrifice principle, morality and the most vulnerable among us for the sacred "achievements" of social and scientific progress.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">This penchant of the president to disregard the importance of protecting innocent human life should come as no surprise.

One would think that such a role would hold great attraction for President Obama in light of his stated commitment to discussion and debate; yet time and again, Mr. Obama has demonstrated that when it comes to protecting innocent human life, he is unwilling to allow ethical concerns to impede scientific "progress."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Mr. Obama appears to view any "advance" in science as an intrinsic good that is always beneficial to mankind. This is the same mentality that animated the eugenics movement of the early 20th century. In the 21st century, this mentality has given rise to a "disposable man" ethic that dictates that embryonic stem cell research should proceed unencumbered, regardless of its lack of success and regardless of the fact that each tiny embryo dissected in our quest for our improvement or immortality represents the willful destruction of nascent human life.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Obama's disposable man mentality may also be seen in his approach to pregnancy and abortion. His decision to de-fund abstinence education makes it clear that he sees no utility in a principled approach to preventing unplanned pregnancies. Obama apparently believes that the abstinence-only approach is stifling and outdated. Why encourage teens to defer sex until marriage? Their hormones are, after all, raging. Weâ€™ll just provide condoms on the front end, and if that doesnâ€™t do the trick, abortion on the back endâ€”all at taxpayer expense, of course.
