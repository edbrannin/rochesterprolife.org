Every abortion kills a living human being - that is a fact.

"School District #3" continued, An Analysis of Planned Parenthood’s Family Life Education Program <br />
From <em>Parent Power!!</em> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Last month we told readers about a Family Life Education program implemented in School District #3 by Planned Parenthood and pointed out that, despite protests from parents, these programs often make their way into schools because of high local teen pregnancy or STD rates.&#160; Often FLE programs are pushed as a good for the entire community when, in fact, they have been proven failures throughout the country.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Parents in School District #3 were making progress with the school superintendent who arranged for a follow-up meeting about the FLE program and who did commit to making changes including the removal of contraceptive-pushing class sessions.&#160; The superintendent opened the next meeting by stating that he was deeply concerned by the parents’ accusation about what the course was teaching the children.&#160; He, himself, had talked with two teenage girls who had been through the course and asked each of them what message they had gotten from the program.&#160; He said that both girls told him that they had clearly gotten the message that it is okay to have pre-marital sex, as long as they didn’t get pregnant!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The superintendent assured the parents that he had personally been involved with the starting of the course and that the message the children were getting was never the intention of the course.&#160; He also revealed that the parts of the program that pushed contraceptive use where not part of the original program.&#160; The FLE director, who remained relatively quiet during this meeting, stated that the course had been updated and refined each year and that not every change was reviewed with school officials.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">*** A note of warning:&#160; this “updating and refining” of courses is one of the reasons parents cannot trust that even a pure biology course will always remain “good.”&#160; STOPP has frequently found Planned Parenthood people willing to implement any program and then work to change it later when the heat is off and the parents are no longer watching what is going on.&#160; Protecting our children is a constant battle.&#160; We must always remember that!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The meeting proceeded calmly until the superintendent told the parents that he would definitely see to it that changes were made in the program.&#160; At this, the representative of the school PTA objected loudly.&#160; She wanted to know how the superintendent could make such a statement to these few parents when she represented all the parents in the district and the PTA supported the program as it stood.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The superintendent did not answer this charge and kept talking with the parents.&#160; He said that the district had already planned a committee to rewrite the curriculum and wanted the parents to participate as members of the committee.&#160; The parents agreed to participate, but reminded the superintendent that their goal was to remove the curriculum from the school, not just to change the wording of it.&#160; They also stated their vehement objection to the involvement of Planned Parenthood in this program.&#160; They further stated their objection to Planned Parenthood’s connection to a planned Wellness Center they had learned about between meetings.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The superintendent told the parents that the school would end all links between the Wellness Center and Planned Parenthood.&#160; In addition, he agreed to stop the practice of having Planned Parenthood train the teachers in the FLE program!&#160; This break in the influence of Planned Parenthood was considered the first objective and it was obtained through diligent work, a clear presentation of the facts and, most importantly, a lot of help from God.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Next Month:&#160; Additional community ties and more on the Wellness Center</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>Union City pastor, anti-abortion leader released from jail<br /></em>OAKLAND -- After 18 days in jail for violating a city law designed to protect women entering abortion clinics, a Berkeley church elder went free Tuesday with a wider, louder network of anti-abortion supporters than before he went to trial.

By Paul A. Byrne, M.D., Richard G. Nilges, M.D. and Walt F. Weaver, M.D.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">You’ve probably seen TV commercials, billboards and magazine articles encouraging you to give the “gift of life” through vital organ donation.&#160; It saves lives and gives meaning to a wasteful, tragic death.&#160; But before you fill out an organ donor card, here are a few things to think about.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Vital organs are those organs like the heart, liver, lungs and pancreas that are necessary for life.&#160; In order to be suitable for transplant, they need to be removed from the donor before respiration and circulation cease.&#160; Otherwise these organs are not suitable, since damage occurs within a brief time after the circulation of oxygenated blood stops.&#160; Removing vital organs from a living person prior to cessation of circulation and respiration will cause death.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Portions of some vital organs can be removed without causing death of the donor; for example, one of two kidneys, a lobe of a liver or a lobe of a lung.&#160; But certain other vital organs, like the heart, cannot be removed without killing the donor.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Since vital organs are not useful once the person is dead, and taking them causes death, how is vital organ removal possible?&#160; This is where “brain death,” which we discussed last month </font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=87&amp;L=646&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">(http://all.org/associates/news.htm</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">), comes into play.&#160; Legally “brain-dead” patients are considered corpses or cadavers, and are called such by organ retrieval networks.&#160; The “corpses” can be used for teaching, for trying out new procedures and for vital organ harvesting.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The federal government is deeply involved in transplant programs for reasons that are unclear.&#160; A federal mandate issued in 1998 states that physicians, nurses, pastors and other health-care workers may not speak to a family of a potential organ donor about transplantation without first obtaining approval from the regional organ retrieval system.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">If there is the possibility of vital organs available for transplant, a trained “designated requester” visits with the family first, even if the family adamantly opposes organ donation.&#160; If someone at the hospital speaks to the family first, the hospital risks losing its accreditation and/or federal funding. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Why the “designated requester”?&#160; Studies show that these people have greater success obtaining permission for organ donation.&#160; They are trained to sell the concept using emotionally-laden phrases such as “gift of life” and other similar platitudes, all empty of any true meaning.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Take a moment to ponder the following:</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">•&#160;Why can health insurance cover intensive care costs on “brain dead” patients?</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial;

These HHS regulations were written in part because of the urgent need for pro-life ob/gyns to be protected from the pro-abortion activism of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, as expressed in Ethics Statement # 385.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The HHS Regulations are a summary of several statutes which Congress passed over the past three decades—the Church Amendments, the Hoekstra-Coates Law, and most recently the Hyde-Weldon Law passed in 2004. These statutes were designed to protect provider conscience rights. The HHS regulation simply clarifies the existing laws, which declare that American tax dollars will not fund programs in which health-care professionals are fired, penalized or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of their ethical stance related to performing or referring for abortion, and other morally controversial issues.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Abortion advocates are misrepresenting the HHS Regulations as threatening the lives of women who will die because they can't get emergency abortions, and arguing that women won't be able to get contraception. These are absurd arguments, and have nothing to do with the actual statues cited, or with the wording of the HHS Regulations.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocates are also arguing that if doctors and other health-care professionals are not forced to perform or refer for abortions, access to health-care services for women will be restricted. In reality, many health-care providers will leave the industry altogether if forced to violate their moral convictions, thereby reducing access to health-care services across the board.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In addition, without the conscience protection regulation, providers opposed to participating in abortion remain susceptible to intolerance and coercion from employers with conflicting beliefs, and to possible lawsuits from outside organizations.<br /><br />

font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Portions reprinted from “Understanding Stem Cell Science” by Peter Hollands, Ph.D. which first appeared in the January/February 2008 issue of <em>Celebrate Life</em></font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Stem cells appear in the news on a regular basis, but the debate seems to be continually fogged by a general lack of understanding about the technology under discussion.&#160; In terms of current and future potential human therapeutic applications, stem cell technology is basically split into two areas:&#160; embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Human embryonic stem cells are derived from human embryos using a technique first developed in mice by Martin Evans, for which he received the 2007 Nobel Prize for Medicine.&#160; This technology basically involves taking a human egg and fertilizing it in vitro.&#160; The resultant embryo grows for the next five days to a blastocyst, which is a hollow ball of around 120 cells with a concentration of cells at one pole called the inner cell mass.&#160; It is the inner cell mass which, if left alone, would go on to form the human fetus and it is the inner cell mass from which embryonic stem cells are derived.&#160; The embryologist uses micro-instruments to dissect the inner cell mass from the rest of the embryo and the cells are then disaggregated and placed on top of further “feeder cells” (usually of animal origin) in another dish.&#160; The dissected inner-cell-mass cells then grow on and form embryonic stem cells capable, in theory, of making every tissue in the body.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">This process clearly requires the creation and destruction of a human embryo, so all of the associated moral ethical, legal and religious objections apply.&#160; In the early days, it was claimed that “spare” embryos frozen in IVF clinics around the world would provide enough embryos for this technology.&#160; It rapidly became clear that this was not the case and alternative technologies began to develop in attempts to minimize objections and create more embryonic stem cells.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In therapeutic cloning, an adult stem cell (like a skin cell, for example) is placed inside a human egg which has had the nucleus removed.&#160; It is artificially stimulated to divide, resulting in a growing embryo.&#160; The embryonic stem cells are then extracted from this embryo as previously described.&#160; The first stumbling block to this technology is obtaining human eggs and that has proved far more difficult than first imagined.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In an attempt to solve the problem of obtaining human eggs for therapeutic cloning, it has been suggested to use animal eggs instead.&#160; Here the animal egg’s nucleus is removed and an adult stem cell added, stimulated to divide and develop.&#160; The problem with this method is that, even after removal of the animal nucleus, there still remains animal DNA within the animal egg (inside mitochondria).&#160; These means that a therapeutic clone produced this way is part animal!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Parthenogenesis is the artificial activation of an egg to begin developing as an embryo without any fertilization or the introduction of an adult cell.&#160; The problems here are again the availability of eggs for such a procedure, but, more importantly, scientists worry about the safety and stability of cells created in such a way.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Embryonic stem cells are therefore derived from the developing embryo and, in their creation, the embryonic human is destroyed.&#160; Embryonic stem cells are currently being created, frozen and banked at various centers around the world.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 signed last week by our president included what is known as the Dickey-Wicker Amendment and states that federal funds may not be used for the “creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes.”&#160; Neither can federal funds be used to conduct “research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded or knowingly subjected to risk of injury.” </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">However, because the president, two days earlier, signed an executive order lifting restrictions placed on embryonic stem cell research in 2001, federal funds may still be used to conduct human embryonic stem cell research as long as those stem cells were taken from human embryos killed by private sources and/or with private funding.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The pro-life community must speak up to put a halt to this sanctioned killing. There are viable and effective alternatives to human embryonic stem cell research that must be expanded. Stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood and adult tissues are but two of the morally acceptable avenues that have shown great promise. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Any person who considers himself pro-life must recognize the inhumanity of human embryonic stem cell research and persuade lawmakers to bring this practice to an end. We can never build a true culture of life when we allow the most vulnerable and innocent of our society to be sacrificed. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>FDA approves Female Health's women's condom</em><br />

Why? I have not explained this in a while, so for the record let me explain it now. Catholics recognize, through our faith, the true body, blood, soul and divinity of Christ present in the sacrament of Holy Communion. When we receive Communion, we are literally receiving Christ into our bodies, our souls, and our hearts … every fiber of our being. We do so with reverence and humility to the extent that our sinful state permits.<br /><br />
We cannot SEE Christ, but we believe He is with us in this most holy Sacrament. In the books of Catholic Church Law, the Code of Canon Law, Volume IV, which is dedicated to the Sacraments and how they are to be administered, you will find </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=277&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Canon 915</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, which states </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Those who have been excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty and others obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">We have focused our attention specifically on the second part of the Church law that states that "others obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to Holy Communion." We know that the act of abortion is a manifest grave sin, and we know that as recently as 2004, Pope Benedict XVI, then </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=278&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, told all of the American Catholic bishops in a memorandum addressed to them </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">4. Apart from an individual's judgment about his worthiness to present himself to receive the Holy Eucharist, the minister of Holy Communion may find himself in the situation where he must refuse to distribute Holy Communion to someone, such as in cases of a declared excommunication, a declared interdict, or an obstinate persistence in manifest grave sin (cf. can. 915). <br /><br />
5. Regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia, when a person's formal cooperation becomes manifest (understood, in the case of a Catholic politician, as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws), his Pastor should meet with him, instructing him about the Church's teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin, and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist. <br /><br />
6. When "these precautionary measures have not had their effect or in which they were not possible," and the person in question, with obstinate persistence, still presents himself to receive the Holy Eucharist, "the minister of Holy Communion must refuse to distribute it" (cf. Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts Declaration "Holy Communion and Divorced, Civilly Remarried Catholics" [2002], nos. 3-4). This decision, properly speaking, is not a sanction or a penalty. Nor is the minister of Holy Communion passing judgment on the person's subjective guilt, but rather is reacting to the person's public unworthiness to receive Holy Communion due to an objective situation of sin. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">We are not brashly accusing bishops or attacking them when we ask them, therefore, to enforce Church law, for our understanding of this particular law is the same as that of Cardinal Ratzinger. Those in public life who display "obstinate persistence" do not deserve to receive the body and blood of Christ because giving them the sacrament is exposing Christ to sacrilege and compounding the sinful nature of the individual pro-abortion public figure's soul. Of that, there is no doubt.<br /><br />
So why haven't the American Catholic bishops understood this in the same way we do? Why haven't they, not to mention every Catholic priest, and Catholic deacon, and extraordinary minister enforced this clear and succinct Church Law? We do not know, but we do not intend to cease our efforts to see that this law is enforced.<br /><br />
Having said that, I also want to add that we are eternally grateful to the sixteen American Catholic bishops who have stood up and acted in defense of Christ. We applaud their courage and praise God for their actions.<br /><br />
The sad reality is, however, that the vast majority of Catholic bishops have not made the commitment to protect Christ from sacrilege by enforcing Canon 915. This is the main reason why we are grateful to our fellow Catholics at the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=279&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">PewSitter web site</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, for initiating an outstanding petition, focused on this specific Canon Law and addressing it to the bishops of the United States.<br /><br />////
American Life League encourages you to read the Petition to Withhold Holy Communion, posted below. Go to the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=280&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">web site location of the petition</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, and add your name to the growing number of Catholics who are making it perfectly clear that the following two fundamental teachings of the Catholic Church inspire us to stand up and proclaim the truth: Christ is truly present in Holy Communion and must be protected from sacrilege. And, the act of abortion is an act of murder; it takes the life of an innocent human being.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">In the United States there has been, and continues to be, an ongoing disregard, by prominent Catholics in public life, of the Church's teaching on a variety of serious moral issues including abortion, euthanasia, human cloning, homosexual "marriage", and human embryonic stem cell research to name a few. <br /><br />
Whereas, many of these prominent Catholics not only disregard the Church's teachings on these issues, but also actively and publicly promote policies and legislation that undermines, opposes and contradicts the Church on these serious moral issues.<br /><br />
Whereas, the Catholic Church has given the local bishop, every ordained Catholic priest and deacon the authority to deal with such manifestations of public disobedience to the Church's teachings.<br /><br />
Whereas, Catholics understand, support and respect the behind-the-scenes dialogue and diplomacy that goes on by our bishops and their priests, with prominent Catholics, to reconcile them with the Church and further recognize that as a Church, it is our strong preference to resolve such issues in private.<br /><br />
However, when prominent Catholics persevere in public, manifest grave sin – it becomes obligatory for a bishop, an ordained priest and/or deacon to take decisive public action and enforce Canon 915 by denying Holy Communion.<br /><br />
The bishop's, ordained Catholic priest's, deacon's, or extraordinary Eucharistic minister's obligation to withhold Communion not only protects the Holy Eucharist from sacrilege, but in addition it is an act of charity intended to protect the prominent Catholic's soul from the possibility of grave sin.<br /><br />
Whereas, bishops, ordained Catholic priests, deacons or extraordinary Eucharistic ministers who do not withhold Communion from such prominent Catholics that obstinately persevere in manifest grave sin, leave the impression such actions are condoned, or at least tolerated, and thereby perpetuate this scandal. <br /><br />
Whereas I, YOUR NAME, a faithful Catholic residing within the diocese of YOUR DIOCESE do find the reception of Holy Communion by these prominent Catholics to be scandalous; that it sets an example that will undoubtedly mislead others into participating, condoning and justifying these same immoral activities.<br /><br />
Whereas I fear for the souls of prominent Catholics in public office who risk further grave sin by receiving the Eucharist unworthily.<br /><br />

I am not talking about faithful Catholics who love their faith and their Church. I am specifically referring to those who insist on defining their religious identity as Catholic, while backing away from, or passionately supporting, the act of abortion.

Most recently, </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=37&amp;L=213&amp;F=H"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Archbishop Charles Chaput</strong></font></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong> of Denver, Colorado, addressed the problem of pro-abortion Catholics in public life.

History teaches us that there is a simple explanation for this current problem, which is not really that current and frankly, not really that difficult to analyze.

For as American Life League's Katie Walker pointed out in a statement given to </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=37&amp;L=249&amp;F=H"><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3"><em>Politico's </em>Ben Smith</font></strong></font></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>, "Brownback's support for Sebelius doesn't undercut pro-lifers one bit.

That is precisely my point. Whether it is a frontal attack on the Catholic Church and her teachings, or a public example of putting politics before principle, Matthews and his ilk are being crass. The message America is getting is that Catholics can pretty much do or say whatever they want, flaunt it in public, and then receive the body and blood of Christ in Holy Communion, without batting an eye or receiving a reprimand from a bishop, priest or deacon.<br /><br />
And you wonder why the Church is facing an identity meltdown in America? I think there is an answer in all this that does not come from me, but from a profoundly holy priest, Father Alfonso Galvez, SICP whose writing was excerpted in the winter 2009 edition of the magazine, <em>Latin Mass</em>.</strong></font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Turning one's back on the truth is, therefore, nothing less than turning one's back on God… If the Truth is God, and God is Love, rejection of the truth is rejection of love. So no matter what anyone may say, contempt for the truth is not so much a matter of the understanding as something to do with the option of the will. Truth is not rejected because one fails to see it, but rather because one does not want it….<br /><br />
It is not surprising, therefore, that man becomes a liar as soon as he turns his back on God.</strong></font></p><p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>This is indeed the problem the Catholic Church is facing today.

Kathleen Sebelius. "The American people will not stand for Sebelius' disturbing and radical record of promoting abortion on demand," said Judie Brown, president of American Life League. "Sebelius, governor of Kansas - the late-term abortion capital of the world - is a threat to the health and well-being of our country and her appointment must be stopped." American Life League's supporters are being activated to fight the Sebelius confirmation. Sebelius' record of unflinching support for abortion on demand has even led her to defend and even entertain notorious Kansas abortionist Dr. George Tiller - now on trial for performing illegal late-term abortions - at the governor's mansion. "Sebelius, Obama's latest appointee has been using her high office to defend and promote one of the bloodiest, most lawless abortionists in the nation. Yet Obama thinks this woman should be in charge of American health and human services! What an insult to the people of this great nation, born and preborn," Brown said.<br />

Applauds Vitter Amendment To Eliminate Planned Parenthood Funding From Omnibus Bill<br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=231&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.all.org/article.php?id=11843</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><font color="#808080">American Life League</font><br />
American Life League applauded today the historic introduction of the Vitter Amendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 1105). “For the first time in the nation’s history an amendment seeking to take money away from Planned Parenthood, by name, has been introduced in the United States Senate,” said Jim Sedlak, vice president of American Life League. The Amendment ensures no Title X funding for the nation’s largest abortion provider will be made available in the Omnibus bill. Title X funding is a "family planning" appropriations program under the Public Health Service Act. Planned Parenthood receives millions of Title X dollars each year for the distribution of birth control and other sex products. Introduced by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, the Vitter Amendment reads: Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be made available to Planned Parenthood for any purpose under title X of the Public Health Service Act. “The denial of Title X funds to Planned Parenthood will save thousands of babies lives," Sedlak said, "and return control of taxpayer funding of organizations to the taxpayers themselves. The majority of US taxpayers have repeatedly shown - they do not want any money going to Planned Parenthood."<br /><br />
Denver Archbishop: "Very Bad Period of Catechesis" in Church "Bearing Bad Fruit in Our Time"<br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=213&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/mar/09030212.html</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">Life Site News<br /></font></span>During a LifeSiteNews interview last week, Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput stressed that "not nearly enough" US Catholic bishops have been speaking out strongly on the current state of the culture. He also noted that the poor instruction of Catholics over the past 40 years has to a large degree been responsible for many of today's serious problems within US Catholicism, especially the lack of "understanding of the horror of abortion." Asked what could be done to get Catholic pro-abortion politicians to comprehend their faith obligations on the abortion issue, Chaput did not give a reassuring response. He stated, "Apparently, very little can be done because so little seems to have been accomplished." He conjectured a likely reason for the current situation has been negligence on the part of the Church leadership in the U.S. "I don't know if it's because we've let it go on for such a long time and haven't challenged it before now, but this attitude of being comfortable with being pro-choice and Catholic at the same time seems to be deeply set in the lives of these folks."&#160; Chaput expanded, "It seems like there has been a very bad period of catechesis of people in the Church, not only catechesis of the laity but also catechesis of the clergy and it's bearing bad fruit in our time."<br /><br />

PPFA was founded with the establishment of the nation's first birth-control clinic in 1916 by Margaret Sanger. The clinic was located in Brownsville, New York, a poor neighborhood of mostly Jews and Italians, establishing a pattern of targeting poor and minority populations for family planning. The organization went through various name changes -- the American Birth Control League (ABCL), the Clinical Research Bureau, the National Committee for Federal Legislation for Birth Control (NCFLBC), the Birth Control Federation of America -- before becoming Planned Parenthood in 1942. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Washington state to allow `dignity' deaths <br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=215&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gEOj2lhkuVJCGiPp-q1UD2ehPnEAD96LDB1O0</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">AP<br /></font></span>Terminally ill patients with less than six months to live will soon be able to ask their doctors to prescribe them lethal medication in Washington state.

Most disturbing among them is her long-held support for the act of abortion. It is this single attribute that perhaps makes her attractive to President Obama, as he sets his sights on her as his nominee for the post of secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. <br /><br />
By the way, those words, "health" and "human services" have a whole lot to do with the defining characteristics of the Sebelius era in Kansas.<br /><br />
For example, out of a sincerely held, very deep belief in the jaundiced view that abortion is nothing more than an aspect of reproductive health services, she has gone out of her way to embrace the culture of death. Her opinion, based on her statements and actions, is that every mother should have the right to choose to end the life of her own preborn child. <br /><br />
Sebelius has explained that though she is "personally opposed to abortion," she is "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=227&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">obligated to uphold state and federal laws and court decisions related to abortion</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">." <br /><br />
When Sebelius vetoed the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=218&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Comprehensive Abortion Reform Act</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> last year, she explained in her veto message,&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">I am concerned about a number of provisions in SB 389. The United States Supreme Court decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. However, SB 389 allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even where it may be necessary to save her life. I am concerned that the bill is likely unconstitutional or even worse, endangers the lives of women...<br /><br />
As Governor, nothing is more important to me than the safety, health and privacy rights of our citizens. I am vetoing SB 389 because it endangers the health of women and is likely to be found in violation [of] the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Kansas.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The governor issued this statement with a straight face, though the message she received from her archbishop should have given her pause, since Sebelius is a so-called Catholic who has supported abortion for more than 20 years. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=219&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Archbishop Joseph Naumann</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> reacted immediately, upon receiving word of the Sebelius veto, and issued this stinging rebuke:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">What makes the governor's actions and advocacy for legalized abortion, throughout her public career, even more painful for me is that she is Catholic. Sadly, Governor Sebelius is not unique in being a Catholic politician supporting legalized abortion. <br /><br />
Since becoming archbishop, I have met with Governor Sebelius several times over many months to discuss with her the grave spiritual and moral consequences of her public actions by which she has cooperated in the procurement of abortions performed in Kansas. My concern has been, as a pastor, both for the spiritual well-being of the governor but also for those who have been misled (scandalized) by her very public support for legalized abortion…<br /><br />
Having made every effort to inform and to persuade Governor Sebelius and after consultation with Bishop Ron Gilmore (Dodge City), Bishop Paul Coakley (Salina) and Bishop Michael Jackels (Wichita), I wrote the governor last August requesting that she refrain from presenting herself for reception of the Eucharist until she had acknowledged the error of her past positions, made a worthy sacramental confession and taken the necessary steps for amendment of her life which would include a public repudiation of her previous efforts and actions in support of laws and policies sanctioning abortion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The archbishop stopped short, however, of stating that if Sebelius approached a priest, deacon or extraordinary minister of Holy Communion to receive the Eucharist, she would be denied. Pity! Sebelius ignored him in the same way she has been ignoring archbishops for years.<br /><br />
Since the archbishop's initial reprimand, things have clearly gotten worse. During the presidential election campaign, then-Senator Barack Obama had Governor Sebelius on his </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=228&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">team of advisors </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">regarding Catholic matters, and the archbishop explained in an interview,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">What I found out after I took the pastoral action with Governor Sebelius is that Senator Obama had her on his advisory committee for Catholics...<br /><br />
I wasn't aware of that [beforehand] but I hope that it alerted Senator Obama that this is not probably somebody that can really counsel you in terms of the mind and the heart of the Church on this very critical and important area.<br /><br />
So I think it would be a bad judgment on Senator Obama's part to select someone who was in conflict with the Church.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">By now, we all realize that now President Obama had no concern whatsoever for authentic Catholic doctrine, nor was he about to take advice from a Catholic who follows what the Church teaches. Quite the contrary, he surrounded himself both then and now with dissenters … Catholics who defied Church teaching and got away with it … and still get away with it!<br /><br />
To this very moment, no firm order has been given that the governor should be denied the sacrament, should she approach for the reception of Holy Communion.<br /><br />
The sad fact is that Sebelius will be making her way through the various government hearings held to ascertain whether or not she could be confirmed as the new HHS secretary under Obama. And during these hearings, she will probably be held to a higher standard by her political peers than she has been by Catholic bishops.&#160;Sebelius has been at the forefront of the abortion rights debate in Kansas for more than 20 years, and has yet to be clearly and resoundingly rebuked.<br /><br />
Bill O'Reilly has claimed that Sebelius is </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=230&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">"not fit to serve"</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">; he based this comment on her public alliance with the infamous late-term abortionist George Tiller. But, sadly, the Catholic bishops have not suggested that she is not fit to call herself Catholic.<br /><br />
Robert Novak labeled Sebelius "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=226&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">the national pro-choice poster girl</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">" in May of last year. However, Catholic bishops have not taken definitive action to make sure she knows she is not authentically Catholic and must cease her public claims to the contrary!<br /><br />
I will give but one example of her long history of carrying the water for the pro-aborts. In Kansas in the 1980s, a mother and her preborn child were murdered in a case similar to the Scott Peterson case. In 1989, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=229&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Sebelius </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">was a state Kansas representative.&#160;A state law was proposed to define preborn babies killed in such ways as persons. But Sebelius opposed it, stating, "I think for me and a lot of other people there are certain inalienable rights established for a person, but those are not applied in utero."<br /><br />
In other words, in 1989, Sebelius refused to acknowledge the fact that a baby exists in his mother's womb prior to birth. That was 20 years ago … the archbishop took no corrective action.<br /><br />
The sad fact is that over these many years, no Catholic bishop has taken steps to correct Sebelius in a meaningful way. She has repeatedly ignored the public statements of her bishops. Over time, Sebelius has become recalcitrant in her support for abortion, which she clearly believes is but another aspect of health care. Sebelius represents all that is despicable about the movement that strives to protect abortion rights at all costs, as though abortion itself were a sacrament.<br /><br />
So now, we come to the present moment and the prospect of having this woman preside over a department concerned with public "health" and the provision of "human services." What an oxymoron that is!<br /><br /></font></strong><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>What kind of health care is it that provides for murdering&#160;an innocent preborn child as a solution to a perceived problem? And what kind of human service is it to discard, on the garbage piles of America, the bodies, bones and blood of little babies who never had a chance to live?<br /><br />
Macabre, is it not, that we are facing the prospect of having an advocate of human butchery in one of the most pivotal positions in our nation's government? It is disturbing as well that a so-called Catholic may assume this role with nary a word of genuine repudiation from Catholic shepherds.</strong></font></p></div><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><font size="4">ALL ASSOCIATES</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Volume 6,</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Number 9&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">March 2,&#160;&#160;2009</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">National Pro-life T-shirt Week!&#160; April 28-May 4<br />

By Paul A. Byrne, M.D., Richard G. Nilges, M.D. and Walt F. Weaver, M.D.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">You’ve probably seen TV commercials, billboards and magazine articles encouraging you to give the “gift of life” through vital organ donation.&#160; It saves lives and gives meaning to a wasteful, tragic death.&#160; But before you fill out an organ donor card, here are a few things to think about.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Vital organs are those organs like the heart, liver, lungs and pancreas that are necessary for life.&#160; In order to be suitable for transplant, they need to be removed from the donor before respiration and circulation cease.&#160; Otherwise these organs are not suitable, since damage occurs within a brief time after the circulation of oxygenated blood stops.&#160; Removing vital organs from a living person prior to cessation of circulation and respiration will cause death.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Portions of some vital organs can be removed without causing death of the donor; for example, one of two kidneys, a lobe of a liver or a lobe of a lung.&#160; But certain other vital organs, like the heart, cannot be removed without killing the donor.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Since vital organs are not useful once the person is dead, and taking them causes death, how is vital organ removal possible?&#160; This is where “brain death,” which we discussed last month </font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=87&amp;L=646&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">(http://all.org/associates/news.htm</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">), comes into play.&#160; Legally “brain-dead” patients are considered corpses or cadavers, and are called such by organ retrieval networks.&#160; The “corpses” can be used for teaching, for trying out new procedures and for vital organ harvesting.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The federal government is deeply involved in transplant programs for reasons that are unclear.&#160; A federal mandate issued in 1998 states that physicians, nurses, pastors and other health-care workers may not speak to a family of a potential organ donor about transplantation without first obtaining approval from the regional organ retrieval system.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">If there is the possibility of vital organs available for transplant, a trained “designated requester” visits with the family first, even if the family adamantly opposes organ donation.&#160; If someone at the hospital speaks to the family first, the hospital risks losing its accreditation and/or federal funding. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Why the “designated requester”?&#160; Studies show that these people have greater success obtaining permission for organ donation.&#160; They are trained to sell the concept using emotionally-laden phrases such as “gift of life” and other similar platitudes, all empty of any true meaning.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Take a moment to ponder the following:</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">•&#160;Why can health insurance cover intensive care costs on “brain dead” patients?</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">•&#160;Why do “brain dead” patients often receive intravenous fluids, antibiotics, ventilator care and other life support measures?</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial;

These HHS regulations were written in part because of the urgent need for pro-life ob/gyns to be protected from the pro-abortion activism of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, as expressed in Ethics Statement # 385.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The HHS Regulations are a summary of several statutes which Congress passed over the past three decades—the Church Amendments, the Hoekstra-Coates Law, and most recently the Hyde-Weldon Law passed in 2004. These statutes were designed to protect provider conscience rights. The HHS regulation simply clarifies the existing laws, which declare that American tax dollars will not fund programs in which health-care professionals are fired, penalized or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of their ethical stance related to performing or referring for abortion, and other morally controversial issues.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Abortion advocates are misrepresenting the HHS Regulations as threatening the lives of women who will die because they can't get emergency abortions, and arguing that women won't be able to get contraception. These are absurd arguments, and have nothing to do with the actual statues cited, or with the wording of the HHS Regulations.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocates are also arguing that if doctors and other health-care professionals are not forced to perform or refer for abortions, access to health-care services for women will be restricted. In reality, many health-care providers will leave the industry altogether if forced to violate their moral convictions, thereby reducing access to health-care services across the board.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In addition, without the conscience protection regulation, providers opposed to participating in abortion remain susceptible to intolerance and coercion from employers with conflicting beliefs, and to possible lawsuits from outside organizations.<br /><br />

font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Portions reprinted from “Understanding Stem Cell Science” by Peter Hollands, Ph.D. which first appeared in the January/February 2008 issue of <em>Celebrate Life</em></font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Stem cells appear in the news on a regular basis, but the debate seems to be continually fogged by a general lack of understanding about the technology under discussion.&#160; In terms of current and future potential human therapeutic applications, stem cell technology is basically split into two areas:&#160; embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Human embryonic stem cells are derived from human embryos using a technique first developed in mice by Martin Evans, for which he received the 2007 Nobel Prize for Medicine.&#160; This technology basically involves taking a human egg and fertilizing it in vitro.&#160; The resultant embryo grows for the next five days to a blastocyst, which is a hollow ball of around 120 cells with a concentration of cells at one pole called the inner cell mass.&#160; It is the inner cell mass which, if left alone, would go on to form the human fetus and it is the inner cell mass from which embryonic stem cells are derived.&#160; The embryologist uses micro-instruments to dissect the inner cell mass from the rest of the embryo and the cells are then disaggregated and placed on top of further “feeder cells” (usually of animal origin) in another dish.&#160; The dissected inner-cell-mass cells then grow on and form embryonic stem cells capable, in theory, of making every tissue in the body.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">This process clearly requires the creation and destruction of a human embryo, so all of the associated moral ethical, legal and religious objections apply.&#160; In the early days, it was claimed that “spare” embryos frozen in IVF clinics around the world would provide enough embryos for this technology.&#160; It rapidly became clear that this was not the case and alternative technologies began to develop in attempts to minimize objections and create more embryonic stem cells.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In therapeutic cloning, an adult stem cell (like a skin cell, for example) is placed inside a human egg which has had the nucleus removed.&#160; It is artificially stimulated to divide, resulting in a growing embryo.&#160; The embryonic stem cells are then extracted from this embryo as previously described.&#160; The first stumbling block to this technology is obtaining human eggs and that has proved far more difficult than first imagined.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">In an attempt to solve the problem of obtaining human eggs for therapeutic cloning, it has been suggested to use animal eggs instead.&#160; Here the animal egg’s nucleus is removed and an adult stem cell added, stimulated to divide and develop.&#160; The problem with this method is that, even after removal of the animal nucleus, there still remains animal DNA within the animal egg (inside mitochondria).&#160; These means that a therapeutic clone produced this way is part animal!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Parthenogenesis is the artificial activation of an egg to begin developing as an embryo without any fertilization or the introduction of an adult cell.&#160; The problems here are again the availability of eggs for such a procedure, but, more importantly, scientists worry about the safety and stability of cells created in such a way.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Embryonic stem cells are therefore derived from the developing embryo and, in their creation, the embryonic human is destroyed.&#160; Embryonic stem cells are currently being created, frozen and banked at various centers around the world.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 signed last week by our president included what is known as the Dickey-Wicker Amendment and states that federal funds may not be used for the “creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes.”&#160; Neither can federal funds be used to conduct “research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded or knowingly subjected to risk of injury.” </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">However, because the president, two days earlier, signed an executive order lifting restrictions placed on embryonic stem cell research in 2001, federal funds may still be used to conduct human embryonic stem cell research as long as those stem cells were taken from human embryos killed by private sources and/or with private funding.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The pro-life community must speak up to put a halt to this sanctioned killing. There are viable and effective alternatives to human embryonic stem cell research that must be expanded. Stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood and adult tissues are but two of the morally acceptable avenues that have shown great promise. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Any person who considers himself pro-life must recognize the inhumanity of human embryonic stem cell research and persuade lawmakers to bring this practice to an end. We can never build a true culture of life when we allow the most vulnerable and innocent of our society to be sacrificed. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><em>FDA approves Female Health's women's condom</em><br />

Why? I have not explained this in a while, so for the record let me explain it now. Catholics recognize, through our faith, the true body, blood, soul and divinity of Christ present in the sacrament of Holy Communion. When we receive Communion, we are literally receiving Christ into our bodies, our souls, and our hearts … every fiber of our being. We do so with reverence and humility to the extent that our sinful state permits.<br /><br />
We cannot SEE Christ, but we believe He is with us in this most holy Sacrament. In the books of Catholic Church Law, the Code of Canon Law, Volume IV, which is dedicated to the Sacraments and how they are to be administered, you will find </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=277&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Canon 915</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, which states </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Those who have been excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty and others obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">We have focused our attention specifically on the second part of the Church law that states that "others obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to Holy Communion." We know that the act of abortion is a manifest grave sin, and we know that as recently as 2004, Pope Benedict XVI, then </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=278&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, told all of the American Catholic bishops in a memorandum addressed to them </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">4. Apart from an individual's judgment about his worthiness to present himself to receive the Holy Eucharist, the minister of Holy Communion may find himself in the situation where he must refuse to distribute Holy Communion to someone, such as in cases of a declared excommunication, a declared interdict, or an obstinate persistence in manifest grave sin (cf. can. 915). <br /><br />
5. Regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia, when a person's formal cooperation becomes manifest (understood, in the case of a Catholic politician, as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws), his Pastor should meet with him, instructing him about the Church's teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin, and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist. <br /><br />
6. When "these precautionary measures have not had their effect or in which they were not possible," and the person in question, with obstinate persistence, still presents himself to receive the Holy Eucharist, "the minister of Holy Communion must refuse to distribute it" (cf. Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts Declaration "Holy Communion and Divorced, Civilly Remarried Catholics" [2002], nos. 3-4). This decision, properly speaking, is not a sanction or a penalty. Nor is the minister of Holy Communion passing judgment on the person's subjective guilt, but rather is reacting to the person's public unworthiness to receive Holy Communion due to an objective situation of sin. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">We are not brashly accusing bishops or attacking them when we ask them, therefore, to enforce Church law, for our understanding of this particular law is the same as that of Cardinal Ratzinger. Those in public life who display "obstinate persistence" do not deserve to receive the body and blood of Christ because giving them the sacrament is exposing Christ to sacrilege and compounding the sinful nature of the individual pro-abortion public figure's soul. Of that, there is no doubt.<br /><br />
So why haven't the American Catholic bishops understood this in the same way we do? Why haven't they, not to mention every Catholic priest, and Catholic deacon, and extraordinary minister enforced this clear and succinct Church Law? We do not know, but we do not intend to cease our efforts to see that this law is enforced.<br /><br />
Having said that, I also want to add that we are eternally grateful to the sixteen American Catholic bishops who have stood up and acted in defense of Christ. We applaud their courage and praise God for their actions.<br /><br />
The sad reality is, however, that the vast majority of Catholic bishops have not made the commitment to protect Christ from sacrilege by enforcing Canon 915. This is the main reason why we are grateful to our fellow Catholics at the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=279&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">PewSitter web site</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, for initiating an outstanding petition, focused on this specific Canon Law and addressing it to the bishops of the United States.<br /><br />//
American Life League encourages you to read the Petition to Withhold Holy Communion, posted below. Go to the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=40&amp;L=280&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">web site location of the petition</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, and add your name to the growing number of Catholics who are making it perfectly clear that the following two fundamental teachings of the Catholic Church inspire us to stand up and proclaim the truth: Christ is truly present in Holy Communion and must be protected from sacrilege. And, the act of abortion is an act of murder; it takes the life of an innocent human being.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">In the United States there has been, and continues to be, an ongoing disregard, by prominent Catholics in public life, of the Church's teaching on a variety of serious moral issues including abortion, euthanasia, human cloning, homosexual "marriage", and human embryonic stem cell research to name a few. <br /><br />
Whereas, many of these prominent Catholics not only disregard the Church's teachings on these issues, but also actively and publicly promote policies and legislation that undermines, opposes and contradicts the Church on these serious moral issues.<br /><br />
Whereas, the Catholic Church has given the local bishop, every ordained Catholic priest and deacon the authority to deal with such manifestations of public disobedience to the Church's teachings.<br /><br />
Whereas, Catholics understand, support and respect the behind-the-scenes dialogue and diplomacy that goes on by our bishops and their priests, with prominent Catholics, to reconcile them with the Church and further recognize that as a Church, it is our strong preference to resolve such issues in private.<br /><br />
However, when prominent Catholics persevere in public, manifest grave sin – it becomes obligatory for a bishop, an ordained priest and/or deacon to take decisive public action and enforce Canon 915 by denying Holy Communion.<br /><br />
The bishop's, ordained Catholic priest's, deacon's, or extraordinary Eucharistic minister's obligation to withhold Communion not only protects the Holy Eucharist from sacrilege, but in addition it is an act of charity intended to protect the prominent Catholic's soul from the possibility of grave sin.<br /><br />
Whereas, bishops, ordained Catholic priests, deacons or extraordinary Eucharistic ministers who do not withhold Communion from such prominent Catholics that obstinately persevere in manifest grave sin, leave the impression such actions are condoned, or at least tolerated, and thereby perpetuate this scandal. <br /><br />
Whereas I, YOUR NAME, a faithful Catholic residing within the diocese of YOUR DIOCESE do find the reception of Holy Communion by these prominent Catholics to be scandalous; that it sets an example that will undoubtedly mislead others into participating, condoning and justifying these same immoral activities.<br /><br />
Whereas I fear for the souls of prominent Catholics in public office who risk further grave sin by receiving the Eucharist unworthily.<br /><br />

I am not talking about faithful Catholics who love their faith and their Church. I am specifically referring to those who insist on defining their religious identity as Catholic, while backing away from, or passionately supporting, the act of abortion.

Most recently, </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=37&amp;L=213&amp;F=H"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Archbishop Charles Chaput</strong></font></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong> of Denver, Colorado, addressed the problem of pro-abortion Catholics in public life.

History teaches us that there is a simple explanation for this current problem, which is not really that current and frankly, not really that difficult to analyze.

For as American Life League's Katie Walker pointed out in a statement given to </strong></font><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=37&amp;L=249&amp;F=H"><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3"><em>Politico's </em>Ben Smith</font></strong></font></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>, "Brownback's support for Sebelius doesn't undercut pro-lifers one bit.

That is precisely my point. Whether it is a frontal attack on the Catholic Church and her teachings, or a public example of putting politics before principle, Matthews and his ilk are being crass. The message America is getting is that Catholics can pretty much do or say whatever they want, flaunt it in public, and then receive the body and blood of Christ in Holy Communion, without batting an eye or receiving a reprimand from a bishop, priest or deacon.<br /><br />
And you wonder why the Church is facing an identity meltdown in America? I think there is an answer in all this that does not come from me, but from a profoundly holy priest, Father Alfonso Galvez, SICP whose writing was excerpted in the winter 2009 edition of the magazine, <em>Latin Mass</em>.</strong></font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Turning one's back on the truth is, therefore, nothing less than turning one's back on God… If the Truth is God, and God is Love, rejection of the truth is rejection of love. So no matter what anyone may say, contempt for the truth is not so much a matter of the understanding as something to do with the option of the will. Truth is not rejected because one fails to see it, but rather because one does not want it….<br /><br />
It is not surprising, therefore, that man becomes a liar as soon as he turns his back on God.</strong></font></p><p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>This is indeed the problem the Catholic Church is facing today.

Kathleen Sebelius. "The American people will not stand for Sebelius' disturbing and radical record of promoting abortion on demand," said Judie Brown, president of American Life League. "Sebelius, governor of Kansas - the late-term abortion capital of the world - is a threat to the health and well-being of our country and her appointment must be stopped." American Life League's supporters are being activated to fight the Sebelius confirmation. Sebelius' record of unflinching support for abortion on demand has even led her to defend and even entertain notorious Kansas abortionist Dr. George Tiller - now on trial for performing illegal late-term abortions - at the governor's mansion. "Sebelius, Obama's latest appointee has been using her high office to defend and promote one of the bloodiest, most lawless abortionists in the nation. Yet Obama thinks this woman should be in charge of American health and human services! What an insult to the people of this great nation, born and preborn," Brown said.<br />

Applauds Vitter Amendment To Eliminate Planned Parenthood Funding From Omnibus Bill<br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=231&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.all.org/article.php?id=11843</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><font color="#808080">American Life League</font><br />
American Life League applauded today the historic introduction of the Vitter Amendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 1105). “For the first time in the nation’s history an amendment seeking to take money away from Planned Parenthood, by name, has been introduced in the United States Senate,” said Jim Sedlak, vice president of American Life League. The Amendment ensures no Title X funding for the nation’s largest abortion provider will be made available in the Omnibus bill. Title X funding is a "family planning" appropriations program under the Public Health Service Act. Planned Parenthood receives millions of Title X dollars each year for the distribution of birth control and other sex products. Introduced by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, the Vitter Amendment reads: Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be made available to Planned Parenthood for any purpose under title X of the Public Health Service Act. “The denial of Title X funds to Planned Parenthood will save thousands of babies lives," Sedlak said, "and return control of taxpayer funding of organizations to the taxpayers themselves. The majority of US taxpayers have repeatedly shown - they do not want any money going to Planned Parenthood."<br /><br />
Denver Archbishop: "Very Bad Period of Catechesis" in Church "Bearing Bad Fruit in Our Time"<br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=213&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/mar/09030212.html</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">Life Site News<br /></font></span>During a LifeSiteNews interview last week, Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput stressed that "not nearly enough" US Catholic bishops have been speaking out strongly on the current state of the culture. He also noted that the poor instruction of Catholics over the past 40 years has to a large degree been responsible for many of today's serious problems within US Catholicism, especially the lack of "understanding of the horror of abortion." Asked what could be done to get Catholic pro-abortion politicians to comprehend their faith obligations on the abortion issue, Chaput did not give a reassuring response. He stated, "Apparently, very little can be done because so little seems to have been accomplished." He conjectured a likely reason for the current situation has been negligence on the part of the Church leadership in the U.S. "I don't know if it's because we've let it go on for such a long time and haven't challenged it before now, but this attitude of being comfortable with being pro-choice and Catholic at the same time seems to be deeply set in the lives of these folks."&#160; Chaput expanded, "It seems like there has been a very bad period of catechesis of people in the Church, not only catechesis of the laity but also catechesis of the clergy and it's bearing bad fruit in our time."<br /><br />

PPFA was founded with the establishment of the nation's first birth-control clinic in 1916 by Margaret Sanger. The clinic was located in Brownsville, New York, a poor neighborhood of mostly Jews and Italians, establishing a pattern of targeting poor and minority populations for family planning. The organization went through various name changes -- the American Birth Control League (ABCL), the Clinical Research Bureau, the National Committee for Federal Legislation for Birth Control (NCFLBC), the Birth Control Federation of America -- before becoming Planned Parenthood in 1942. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Washington state to allow `dignity' deaths <br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=215&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gEOj2lhkuVJCGiPp-q1UD2ehPnEAD96LDB1O0</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">AP<br /></font></span>Terminally ill patients with less than six months to live will soon be able to ask their doctors to prescribe them lethal medication in Washington state.

Most disturbing among them is her long-held support for the act of abortion. It is this single attribute that perhaps makes her attractive to President Obama, as he sets his sights on her as his nominee for the post of secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. <br /><br />
By the way, those words, "health" and "human services" have a whole lot to do with the defining characteristics of the Sebelius era in Kansas.<br /><br />
For example, out of a sincerely held, very deep belief in the jaundiced view that abortion is nothing more than an aspect of reproductive health services, she has gone out of her way to embrace the culture of death. Her opinion, based on her statements and actions, is that every mother should have the right to choose to end the life of her own preborn child. <br /><br />
Sebelius has explained that though she is "personally opposed to abortion," she is "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=227&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">obligated to uphold state and federal laws and court decisions related to abortion</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">." <br /><br />
When Sebelius vetoed the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=218&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Comprehensive Abortion Reform Act</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> last year, she explained in her veto message,&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">I am concerned about a number of provisions in SB 389. The United States Supreme Court decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. However, SB 389 allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even where it may be necessary to save her life. I am concerned that the bill is likely unconstitutional or even worse, endangers the lives of women...<br /><br />
As Governor, nothing is more important to me than the safety, health and privacy rights of our citizens. I am vetoing SB 389 because it endangers the health of women and is likely to be found in violation [of] the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Kansas.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The governor issued this statement with a straight face, though the message she received from her archbishop should have given her pause, since Sebelius is a so-called Catholic who has supported abortion for more than 20 years. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=219&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Archbishop Joseph Naumann</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> reacted immediately, upon receiving word of the Sebelius veto, and issued this stinging rebuke:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">What makes the governor's actions and advocacy for legalized abortion, throughout her public career, even more painful for me is that she is Catholic. Sadly, Governor Sebelius is not unique in being a Catholic politician supporting legalized abortion. <br /><br />
Since becoming archbishop, I have met with Governor Sebelius several times over many months to discuss with her the grave spiritual and moral consequences of her public actions by which she has cooperated in the procurement of abortions performed in Kansas. My concern has been, as a pastor, both for the spiritual well-being of the governor but also for those who have been misled (scandalized) by her very public support for legalized abortion…<br /><br />
Having made every effort to inform and to persuade Governor Sebelius and after consultation with Bishop Ron Gilmore (Dodge City), Bishop Paul Coakley (Salina) and Bishop Michael Jackels (Wichita), I wrote the governor last August requesting that she refrain from presenting herself for reception of the Eucharist until she had acknowledged the error of her past positions, made a worthy sacramental confession and taken the necessary steps for amendment of her life which would include a public repudiation of her previous efforts and actions in support of laws and policies sanctioning abortion.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The archbishop stopped short, however, of stating that if Sebelius approached a priest, deacon or extraordinary minister of Holy Communion to receive the Eucharist, she would be denied. Pity! Sebelius ignored him in the same way she has been ignoring archbishops for years.<br /><br />
Since the archbishop's initial reprimand, things have clearly gotten worse. During the presidential election campaign, then-Senator Barack Obama had Governor Sebelius on his </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=228&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">team of advisors </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">regarding Catholic matters, and the archbishop explained in an interview,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">What I found out after I took the pastoral action with Governor Sebelius is that Senator Obama had her on his advisory committee for Catholics...<br /><br />
I wasn't aware of that [beforehand] but I hope that it alerted Senator Obama that this is not probably somebody that can really counsel you in terms of the mind and the heart of the Church on this very critical and important area.<br /><br />
So I think it would be a bad judgment on Senator Obama's part to select someone who was in conflict with the Church.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">By now, we all realize that now President Obama had no concern whatsoever for authentic Catholic doctrine, nor was he about to take advice from a Catholic who follows what the Church teaches. Quite the contrary, he surrounded himself both then and now with dissenters … Catholics who defied Church teaching and got away with it … and still get away with it!<br /><br />
To this very moment, no firm order has been given that the governor should be denied the sacrament, should she approach for the reception of Holy Communion.<br /><br />
The sad fact is that Sebelius will be making her way through the various government hearings held to ascertain whether or not she could be confirmed as the new HHS secretary under Obama. And during these hearings, she will probably be held to a higher standard by her political peers than she has been by Catholic bishops.&#160;Sebelius has been at the forefront of the abortion rights debate in Kansas for more than 20 years, and has yet to be clearly and resoundingly rebuked.<br /><br />
Bill O'Reilly has claimed that Sebelius is </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=230&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">"not fit to serve"</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">; he based this comment on her public alliance with the infamous late-term abortionist George Tiller. But, sadly, the Catholic bishops have not suggested that she is not fit to call herself Catholic.<br /><br />
Robert Novak labeled Sebelius "</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=226&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">the national pro-choice poster girl</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">" in May of last year. However, Catholic bishops have not taken definitive action to make sure she knows she is not authentically Catholic and must cease her public claims to the contrary!<br /><br />
I will give but one example of her long history of carrying the water for the pro-aborts. In Kansas in the 1980s, a mother and her preborn child were murdered in a case similar to the Scott Peterson case. In 1989, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=32&amp;L=229&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Sebelius </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">was a state Kansas representative.&#160;A state law was proposed to define preborn babies killed in such ways as persons. But Sebelius opposed it, stating, "I think for me and a lot of other people there are certain inalienable rights established for a person, but those are not applied in utero."<br /><br />
In other words, in 1989, Sebelius refused to acknowledge the fact that a baby exists in his mother's womb prior to birth. That was 20 years ago … the archbishop took no corrective action.<br /><br />
The sad fact is that over these many years, no Catholic bishop has taken steps to correct Sebelius in a meaningful way. She has repeatedly ignored the public statements of her bishops. Over time, Sebelius has become recalcitrant in her support for abortion, which she clearly believes is but another aspect of health care. Sebelius represents all that is despicable about the movement that strives to protect abortion rights at all costs, as though abortion itself were a sacrament.<br /><br />
So now, we come to the present moment and the prospect of having this woman preside over a department concerned with public "health" and the provision of "human services." What an oxymoron that is!<br /><br /></font></strong><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>What kind of health care is it that provides for murdering&#160;an innocent preborn child as a solution to a perceived problem? And what kind of human service is it to discard, on the garbage piles of America, the bodies, bones and blood of little babies who never had a chance to live?<br /><br />
Macabre, is it not, that we are facing the prospect of having an advocate of human butchery in one of the most pivotal positions in our nation's government? It is disturbing as well that a so-called Catholic may assume this role with nary a word of genuine repudiation from Catholic shepherds.</strong></font></p></div><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><font size="4">ALL ASSOCIATES</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Volume 6,</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Number 9&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">March 2,&#160;&#160;2009</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">National Pro-life T-shirt Week!&#160; April 28-May 4<br />
