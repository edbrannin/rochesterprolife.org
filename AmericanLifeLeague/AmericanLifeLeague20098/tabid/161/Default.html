From <em>Handbook on Population</em> by Robert Sassone</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">World population growth is caused by more people being born than are dying. Before 1800, there was slow population growth with high birth rates but also high death rates. After 1800, the death rate declined and people lived longer in more developed countries. After about 1945, the technologies that had previously helped people in the developed countries (like antibiotics and DDT) spread throughout the world helping people on all of the continents to live longer. Even though fertility (the average number of children born to each woman) declined, substantial population growth occurred due to the greater number of older people. Population growth peaked about 1979 then grew at a lesser rate as fertility continued to decline.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Substantial population decline usually follows a fertility decline that has fallen below replacement level by about twenty to thirty years. That is the time it takes for the earlier fertility decline to substantially reduce the number of women of child bearing years in the next generation. Replacement level is 2.1 children born per woman, so that the average woman has one daughter.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Fertility in developed countries began to fall around 1960 and fell below replacement level about 1975. Births in the developed countries began declining about 1965 and throughout the world about 1985.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Every two years, the UN Population Division publishes World Population Prospects which projects population levels throughout the world in the coming years. During the early 1990’s, the UNPD assumed that the fertility rate in countries having below replacement fertility rates would somehow increase them. This has not happened.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">There are about 25 factors that substantially influence fertility rates. During recent decades, each and every one of these factors has acted to reduce fertility rates.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Some of the factors caused by modern life that reduce fertility include:</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Urbanization – children cannot work at early ages and do not make the family more prosperous as they would in the countryside, so the fertility rate declines.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Female education – women who pursue advanced education have their first child at an older age and, because of competing priorities, have fewer children after beginning child bearing.&#160; Additionally, a higher percentage of more educated women never marry.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Lower child mortality – in most countries, there is no old age income so most elderly must be supported by their children, typically sons. To ensure that one has a son who survives, it is prudent to actually have two or three. As child mortality declines, it becomes less necessary to have several sons.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Female job opportunities outside the home – women employed outside the home tend to have responsibilities, opportunities and distractions that decrease factors that might otherwise lead them to have more children.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;A desire for more material things – more people opt for the material rewards that more money brings instead of the non-material and emotional rewards of parenthood.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Government programs – many developing country governments act to reduce births because of a fear of runaway population growth or pressure from the World Bank, UN agencies (UNFPA), the US Government, well-funded pressure groups such as Planned Parenthood, media manipulation and others. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Despite having spent billions of dollars in research, studies, subsidies to parents and even legislation, no country has been unable to increase its fertility permanently to replacement level.&#160; These massive failed efforts show that, at the present time, it is either impossible to increase fertility back to replacement level or that we do not know how.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The new UNPD system of projecting has reduced the world population projection for the year 2050 by about 400 million people.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Next month:&#160; Species extinction</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>American health care reform - A good end does not justify evil means<br /></em>All persons of good will need to understand the clear and present danger with which the U.S. is being menaced by the health reform proposed by the Obama Administration.

From <span style="font-style: italic">Parent Power!!</span> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Last month we began a look at the basic philosophies of Planned Parenthood as they relate to the subjects taught in typical Family Life Education programs.&#160; Our source for determining these philosophies is a book entitled <span style="font-style: italic">How to Talk with Your Child About Sexuality</span> which was written by Faye Wattleton while she was president of Planned Parenthood (Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., Garden City, New York; copyright 1986 Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.).</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">As previously noted, the stated intent of this book (page 5) is to provide parents with information on the subject of sexuality so that parents can become “the best source” of information for their children. The book then proceeds to offer information on a variety topics concerning sexuality. Of particular interest is some of the information provided in Chapter 7, “The Top Seven Questions.”&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">In addition to puberty, intercourse and pregnancy which we discussed earlier, no sane person would expect Planned Parenthood to write a book about sexuality without a strong pitch for birth control. After all, it is their main business. The title of this section of the book is very revealing, however, because the chief aim of Planned Parenthood is to control births, not prevent pregnancies. This is illustrated on page 180 of the Appendix where abortion is listed along with the IUD, the pill and other forms of birth control as a method of “fertility control.” The book strongly recommends that parents talk to their teenagers and help them acquire birth control devices.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Planned Parenthood gives lip service to the real problem of sending confusing messages to the children. The confusing message comes from saying that they should not engage in sexual intercourse but then giving them birth control devices “in case they do.”&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Planned Parenthood always rejects any discussion of morals and you will find none in this book. God is never mentioned and religious values are only given passing mention on the way to making Planned Parenthood’s own case. On page 86, the reader will find the following statement:</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">“If parents do not want their children to become pregnant or to make someone pregnant while they are teenagers, they must give them information about contraception and, by so doing, give them permission to use it when they have sex.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Notice, it’s not “if” they have sex, but “when” they have sex. This illustrates the basic philosophy of Planned Parenthood, which is that all kids are going to have sex anyway, so we might as well accept that fact and stop them from getting pregnant. According to Planned Parenthood, it’s getting pregnant that is the major problem, not engaging in promiscuous sexual behavior at 15 years of age!&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Another of Planned Parenthood’s “Top Seven” involves sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This section of the book gives a basic description of STDs and some of the effects. Along with the appendix, it contains some good scientific information on the diseases. Not once in this section, however, is it ever mentioned that the existence of STDs and their prevalence among sexually active teens is a strong case for remaining chaste. Parents are not encouraged to use this information in an attempt to dissuade their teens from having sex. Rather, parents are encouraged to talk about STDs with their kids and to let them know that “it is easy to get medical treatment for STDs.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">What does one expect from an organization that makes a great deal of money from the sale of birth control devices – and from an organization whose president was quoted in the <span style="font-style: italic">Los Angeles Times</span> in 1987 as stating that Planned Parenthood “will not be an organization that promotes chastity”?&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">It is not in Planned Parenthood’s financial interest to encourage children not to have sex and this is seen repeatedly throughout all of its programs. As soon as the general public grasps this one fact, Planned Parenthood’s days will be numbered.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">And that is why we fight …</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Next month:&#160; School Districts 4 and 5</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="5">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4"><em>The Pill and the debt<br /></em>It was probably a Freudian slip.

And in this case, despite the denials and personal attacks on upstanding Americans such as Sarah Palin, the truth is getting out, and then some.<br /><br />
Obamacare's Trojan horse, known in some circles, as the â€œdeath panel provision, is Obama's Achilles heel. Even though those pesky â€œdeath panel discussions have taken a turn, not all of us are convinced. Some Americans actually think that just because the Senate has announced that the panels are coming out of its version of </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2354&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obamacare</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;we should all heave a sigh of relief and go on about our business. After all, folks, they would argue, don't we all know how sincerely these men and women in the U.S. Congress care about the views of average Americans like you and me and how they are always looking out for us? Well â€¦<br /><br />
For those of us who live in the real world, the news out of Washington that those panels are allegedly gone is nothing to get excited about. What the Senate took out is a reference to advance care planning consultations. The Senate has not removed references to the Independent Medicare Advisory Commission, nor has it finalized any piece of legislation. As we have learned over the years, what was there yesterday and appears to be gone today could come back in a different form tomorrow. It's sort of like a chameleon; the lizard changes color to adapt to its surroundings.<br /><br />
But there's a little more to this story than a </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2356&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sarah Palin</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> versus Barack Obama debate.

And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their â€œlevel of productivity in society,whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2348&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sowell</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">, to whom Palin refers, is a wise man who opined,&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">An old advertising slogan said, "Progress is our most important product." With politicians, confusion is their most important product. They confuse bringing down the price of medical care with bringing down the cost.

Nothing is easier than for governments to impose price controls. They have been doing this, off and on, for thousands of years â€“ repeatedly resulting in (1) shortages, (2) quality deterioration and (3) black markets. Why would anyone want any of those things when it comes to medical care?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">And this is precisely where Palin is going with her reference to â€œdeath panels and the vulnerable.

But don't take my word for it. Just yesterday, the <em>Washington Times</em> published an article written by attorney Robert W. Painter, who handles medical malpractice matters and testified before the Texas legislature on that state's </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2359&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Advance Directives</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> Act of 1999. In Death Panels exist already, Painter writes about what has occurred as a direct result of the Act becoming law. And he warns that what has happened in Texas is a harbinger of what could happen nationwide if the Obama proposal moves forward. The results in Texas have been devastating for families.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The end-of-life provisions of the Obama health care plan would upset the balance of power in health care decision-making in favor of doctors and hospitals and against individuals and families. The federal legislation provides an economic incentive for doctors and hospital administrators to use Medicare funds to start hastening certain patient deaths a bit sooner under existing state laws. In Texas, that balance already is tipped in favor of the health care providers, and the proposed federal legislation would only make matters worse by placing more Medicare dollars on that side of the scale.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican, is rightly concerned that the end-of-life provisions in the proposed federal law could be "misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly." Federal lawmakers interested in protecting individual and patient rights need to study carefully the end-of-life provisions with the understanding that the law will be implemented in health care settings governed under 50 different sets of state law.<br /><br />
Admittedly, the warning of "death panels" is a shocking claim. But when I inform people of the effect of the Texas law and how it has trampled on individual rights, they are understandably shocked. If the Texas Advance Directives Act has shown us anything, it is that governments should leave end-of-life decisions to patients and their families.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">It occurs to me that President Obama's rush to impose his prescription for health care reform on the nation is riddled through and through with problems. But at the core of it all, the real question is why should the federal government be regulating medical practices as a way of cutting costs?&#160;<br /><br />

The relationship at issue, then, was doctor-patient, not husband-wife. Yet Douglas framed his opinion around a presumed right to marital privacy. He expounded at length about the sanctity of marriage but used vague phrasing to describe the rights at issue, never explicitly stating that married couples have a right to use contraceptives. He even raised the ugly specter of sex police, though no police had intruded into anyone's bedroom. â€œWould we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?

The urban legends he has told to garner support for the march towards socialism are finally losing their traction.<br /><br />
You could hear the sound of screeching brakes all over America at the collision between an elite Harvard professor and a president making a racial incident out of a police officer's response to a 911 call&#160; and the government takeover of health care. America is coming out of the trance.<br /><br />
As a warrior in the trenches, I couldn't count the number of times prayer mercenaries have transformed a blunder into a period of grace. Catholics had better take full advantage of the reprieve. We have a lot to lose in the ethical conundrums of rationing treatment and mercy in a government-controlled HMO.<br /><br />
The mission of providing ethical, compassionate, quality health care to the sick and poor is about to be reformed into setting criteria that determine the value of the patient's life measured against the cost of treating their illness.<br /><br />
The Church's teachings<br /><br />
Denying medical care to the poor, elderly and catastrophically ill to benefit the government is diametrically opposed to Catholic ethics and the Catholic animus. Pope Benedict XVI expounded on [t]he inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual as a <em>constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation</em> (<em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2284&amp;F=H">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></em>,&#160;Section 2273, emphasis in original) in his recently published encyclical, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=1724&amp;F=H">Caritas in Veritate</a></em>:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4"><em>Openness to life is at the centre of true development.</em> When a society moves towards the denial or suppression of life, it ends up no longer finding the necessary motivation and energy to strive for man's true good (Section 28, emphasis in original)<br /><br />
In order to protect nature, it is not enough to intervene with economic incentives or deterrents; not even an apposite education is sufficient. These are important steps, but <em>the decisive issue is the overall moral tenor of society</em>. If there is a lack of respect for the right to life and to a natural death, if human conception, gestation and birth are made artificial, if human embryos are sacrificed to research, the conscience of society ends up losing the concept of human ecology (Section 51, emphasis in original)<br /><br />
To the tragic and widespread scourge of abortion we may well have to add in the future indeed it is already surreptitiously present&#160; the systematic eugenic programming of births. At the other end of the spectrum, a pro-euthanasia mindset is making inroads as an equally damaging assertion of control over life that under certain circumstances is deemed no longer worth living. Underlying these scenarios are cultural viewpoints that deny human dignity. These practices in turn foster a materialistic and mechanistic understanding of human life. Who could measure the negative effects of this kind of mentality for development?... While the poor of the world continue knocking on the doors of the rich, the world of affluence runs the risk of no longer hearing those knocks, on account of a conscience that can no longer distinguish what is human. (Section 75)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Obama projects that giving access to our health care system to 50 million more people will cost Americans less money than it does now. In fact, at the breaking point, Obama claims his health care program will start paying for itself. Like his projections about the economy, writing off the debt of irresponsible people who caused the mortgage crisis, cash for clunkers and â€œracial profiling, Obama is, once again, way off the mark. <br />
You don't have to be a mathematician to figure out that giving access to 50 million more people in an already burdened health care system and spending less means the patients currently in the system will be sacrificing their present level of care and services. There have been negative impacts&#160;on health care access, cancer survival rates, and the quality of life for the elderly, learning disabled and sick in every country where there has been a government takeover of health care. Obama can't escape the laws of supply and demand. Supporting laws destined to place life-threatening hardships upon the disadvantaged and suffering is fundamentally immoral.<br /><br />
We've got to digest the threats to the sanctity of life and Catholic conscience protections, educate grassroots Catholics and make a lot of noise in the public square in the next several weeks.

Stand up and fight.<br /><br />
The threat to the elderly<br /><br />
Reading the proposals, there is no doubt that seniors would pay a heavy price. The White House has proposed the creation of an independent panel to recommend Medicare and Medicaid cuts. Seniors would not only be losing benefits. From all indications, it appears that they would be losing control over life-and-death decisions and care. This is inhumane.<br /><br />
Last week, EWTN's </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2296&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Raymond Arroyo</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;put up a must-read post on his blog, raising the same concerns many have over disturbing references in the bill:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The elderly or people with catastrophic diseases are clearly in the sights of the administration and the congressional leadership for the simple reason that they cost too much. A quarter of all Medicare payments occur in the last year of life, costing the government more than 100 billion dollars a year, according to <em>Forbes Magazine</em>.<br /><br />
One troubling provision of the House bill compels seniors to submit to a counseling session every five years (and more often if they become sick or go into a nursing home) about alternatives for end-of-life care (House bill, p. 425-430). The sessions cover highly sensitive matters such as whether to receive antibiotics and the use of artificially administered nutrition and hydration.â€™ This mandate invites abuse, and seniors could easily be pushed to refuse care. [interview with Betsy McCaughey, patient advocate and former lieutenant governor of New York]<br /><br />
This Advance Care Planning Consultation would encourage all of us, but especially those with severe illnesses to submit to hospices rather than pursue expensive therapies that might extend life (and cost a bundle). The bill also establishes a tracking system to insure that doctors are advocating â€œadvance care directives where you predetermine what type of care you would accept or refuse at the end of life. The problem with all of this is it assigns a utilitarian value to human life. If you are too old or disabled, there will be a built-in incentive to push you into hospice and palliative care rather than work to beat the disease.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">This isn't hype and hysteria from the fringe. Calm, credible people reading the bills are drawing these same conclusions across the board. Arm yourself with citations from the bill, go to senior centers in your hometown and educate them about the contents of the reforms. The mainstream media is not going to publish the truth, but there is nothing holding us back from doing a little â€œcommunity organizing of our own.<br /><br />

The president has surrounded himself with radical pro-abortionists, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who will have a heavy hand of influence in shaping and executing policies. Catholics, other Christians and other decent people can't ignore the dangers of giving such people power over life, death and health. Educate your priests and those in your parish. With enlightenment on Obama's trajectory, the health care bill will take on a new patina.<br /><br />
The Massachusetts experience<br /><br />
Catholics should be outraged that the poor are being used and exploited by the White House to swindle them out of benefits and life itself. Catholics United, Catholic Charities and other social pirates who are propagating the myth that this type of health care reform is about service to the poor should be vigorously castigated. The poor already have health coverage in combined federal- and state- subsidized programs. (For example, in Massachusetts, there is </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2290&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">MassHealth</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160; Medicaid and SCHIP.)<br /><br />

For a family of eight, the household income can be up to $111,080. But families earning $30,000, previously eligible for free health care, are burdened with premiums and co-payments costing nearly $10,000 for the least expensive plan.<br /><br />
In fact, in early July, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2287&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Boston Medical Center</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;(formerly known as Boston City Hospital, serving the poorest of the poor in Boston) filed a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The suit says the hospital will lose more than $100 million next year because the state has lowered Medicaid reimbursement rates and stopped paying Boston Medical â€œreasonable costs for treating other poor patients.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">We filed this suit more in sorrow than in anger, said Elaine Ullian, the hospital's chief executive. â€œWe believe in health care reform to the bottom of our toes, but it was never, ever supposed to be financed on the backs of the poor, and that's what has happened in Massachusetts.<br /><br />

There are valuable lessons to be learned from the Catholic trenches in Boston in terms of what lies ahead nationally. In late February of this year, the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=1174&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Caritas Christi</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;health care delivery network sought and was awarded a contract that includes providing abortions, family planning services and other moral evils to the uncatechized, the unsuspecting poor and women emotionally distraught due to an unplanned pregnancy.<br /><br />
With the advice and public consent of Boston's Cardinal Sean O'Malley, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=1141&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Caritas</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;gave the Commonwealth written assurances that Catholic medical staff would inform women of health care options, including abortions. They appointed NARAL members to serve as advisors and agreed to give them access to monitor Catholic health care workers to ensure compliance.<br /><br />
Caritas set up a corporation, sought out and signed contracts with abortionists, set up a 24-hour family planning/abortion hotline number and hired employees to direct women to the abortionists with whom it contracted and took a 49-percent interest in the operation. A handful of Catholics relentlessly exposed the arrangement and, with some assistance from American Life League, we were able to get&#160;Cardinal </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2285&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">O'Malley</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> to retreat from ownership in the operation.&#160;However, the arrangement marched forward with all the abortion contracts, the 24-hour hotline, written assurances and NARAL oversight of Caritas employees intact.<br /><br />
It should be noted that Cardinal O'Malley tried to generate support for the arrangement by purporting that Catholic theology permitted entering into a contract that binds a Catholic in the performance of moral evils; in effect, he claimed that even though we realize the sinful nature of performing those moral evils, so long as we recruit others to perform the evils, it does not violate Catholic ethics. Theologically, spiritually and ethically, nothing could be more unsound. Knowing something is wrong and sinful, and then baiting somebody else into doing it who doesn't know, compounds the sin.

So this thought came to mind one day.&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
A young woman finds herself living the typical college life: excited about her life to come and fearful of things that can go wrong. In school, she unexpectedly finds the man of her dreams and, although much in love, is panicked and fearful when she finds herself with child.&#160;She consults one of the many â€œfamily planning businesses, and its advice seems reasonable: Protect your college education; protect your future: </font></strong><strong><font size="4"><em>Have an abortion.<br /></em>&#160;<br />
The young woman pauses and again her family planning counselor says, <em>It's in your best interest; it's merely a fetus and of no consequence. </em>As she ponders such assurances from a counselor who seems so caring, a date is set. And then the procedure is performed.<br />
&#160;<br />
Years have now passed, guilt has faded and love has blossomed. The woman now finds herself in the deepest of love with the man of her dreams. They have a beautiful wedding with everyone there, their careers couldn't be better and their life is grand. A great surprise has come to the newly married couple: They have now conceived a child. The young married couple could never have guessed what joy there would be in planning for a first child. A room is chosen and furnished with love. An ultrasound suggests a blue room, and joy is the order of the day.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">One day, the couple decides that a slow walk in the park would be nice. But a thief lurks there in the shadows, waiting to carry out a robbery. Under a shady elm tree, he strikes. At gunpoint, he shouts, Give me your money! They pause; he becomes angry. Her young husband is heroic at heart, but is thrown to the ground. His young bride, still standing, bears the brunt of the thief's anger as a single, surreal pop sounds under the elm tree. The young bride stands there, desperately clutching her stomach.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;&#160;<br />
I end this short story here because here is where humanity takes control of the abortion debate. In life, a person chooses to be honest or not. They choose to follow the natural law "or not".</font></strong></p><p><em><strong><font size="4">Are you an honest person?</font></strong></em></p><p><strong><font size="4">When the young woman was in college, she was told that what was growing inside of her was just a piece of flesh a fetus of no consequence.<br />
&#160;<br /></font></strong><strong><font size="4"><em>When she was struck by the thief's bullet, did she cry out, My fetus, my fetus! or My baby, my baby!?<br /></em>&#160;<br />
Our Creator has endowed us with certain undeniable attributes, chief of which is that the truth is written in every human heart.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The vast majority of women will immediately respond that this&#160;woman cried out, My baby, my baby! Due to political conditioning, some will hesitate to answer this question. However, the truth remains: Our God-given nature tells all of us that what grows within a woman, regardless of her economic, social or political condition, is simply a baby.<br />
&#160;<br />

In its <em>Monday Update</em> last week, Pro-Life Wisconsin published a timely reminder of exactly what the “no exceptions pro-life philosophy” means. It is our pleasure to reprint it here for you:</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Compassionate and Consistent:&#160; The “No-Exceptions” Pro-Life Philosophy</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Totally banning abortion makes some people uncomfortable. We’ve been told time and again there are unique situations for which abortion is the best option. If a lie is repeated often enough, people begin to accept it as truth. Such is the case with the erroneous notion that abortion must be permitted in cases of rape, incest, fetal deformity, or a perceived threat to the mother’s life. A principled commitment to the protection of innocent human life, in all circumstances and at all stages of development, is compassionate and consistent.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Not even in the case of rape or incest? Rape and incest are both criminal acts, and in our system of justice we punish the criminal. We do not punish the victim, nor do we punish the criminal’s children. We are told that if a pregnancy results from an act of rape or incest, the compassionate response is to offer the traumatized woman an abortion. No woman should be “forced to carry that monster’s child,” we are told. The trauma of sexual assault is very real. But why compound such severe trauma with the additional trauma of abortion? The compassionate response to rape and incest is to meet the real needs of the mother. Providing life-affirming medical, financial, and emotional care meets these needs.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Not even in cases of fetal deformity? When abortion is used to solve the problem of a disability, it is discrimination of the most severe kind. These children are not merely discriminated against for their disability; they are killed because of it. Abortions in these cases raise frightening prospects, for if it is right to kill a disabled person in the womb, could it not someday be permissible to kill a disabled infant? A disabled adult? The answer is clearly “no” in those cases; why is there any question when the victim is a child in the womb? Preborn children diagnosed with disabilities deserve to be treated with the same respect as people born with or without a disability.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Not even in the case of a perceived threat to the mother’s life? Medical operations such as the removal of a cancerous uterus or the removal of an ectopic pregnancy are moral even under Catholic teaching and are not considered abortions. Such operations are justified by the “principle of double effect,” because the death of the child is an unintended effect of an operation independently justified to save the mother’s life. They do not involve the intentional and willful destruction of an unborn child. Physicians must make their best effort to save both patients, giving equal care to mother and child. They should never be given a license to intentionally kill either of them. Finally, many abortionists believe the very condition of pregnancy itself is a life-threatening condition. Consequently, a “life of the mother” exception can become a massive statutory loophole through which to drive abortion on demand.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">When those in the pro-life movement support abortion in exceptional cases, it is destructive to the whole movement. The point is to end ALL abortion. The child is ALWAYS an innocent victim. Once pro-lifers say there can be a “good reason” to kill a preborn baby, the foundation of the pro-life movement crumbles. The argument is lost. Either the preborn child is a person, or the child is not a person. Since the preborn child is a person, there can be no exceptions for abortion.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4">Fast Facts and Frequently Asked Questions</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><em><strong><font size="4">Editor's note: In addition to our ongoing monthly features addressing specific topics of interest to the pro-life community (the culture of life, Planned Parenthood, population control, etc.), our new feature, "Fast Facts and Frequently Asked Questions," will highlight some of the most frequently quoted and sought-after facts and statistics pertaining to pro-life matters, as well as answer some of the questions most frequently asked of our office (and probably yours too).

It is extremely dishonest to promote the theory that the pill curtails abortion per se when, in fact, the pill can and does work in three different ways, one of which is abortion. When the pill works by thinning the lining of the uterus, the embryonic child dies and this is known as an early chemical abortion. Therefore, to suggest that the pill "keeps abortions from happening" is not accurate.<br />
&#160;<br />
Further, the birth control pill is known to be carcinogenic and can cause a series of health problems for women and their future children. It has been linked to cancer, heart conditions, thromboembolisms and more. Moreover, it has now been found to have negative effects on the environment, particularly oceans and rivers.<br />
&#160;<br />
There is a great deal of research available on this subject, and we strongly recommend that individuals conduct an independent study of the literature on the pill. A good starting point is The Pill Kills web site (</font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=324&amp;L=1035&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">www.thepillkills.com</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">). The material that we cite is of exactly the same nature as the material cited by pill advocates. Obviously, each side emphasizes the facts according to its own perspective, so we are not guilty of anything unique when it comes to discussing or debating the birth control pill.&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
We have never believed it is compassionate to deceive people by only telling them what they want to hear. There are cruel facts about the birth control pill that rarely see the light of day. It is our responsibility to make sure we provide this information through our educational outreach, so that, regardless of one’s opinion, he or she has all the facts before making a decision one way or the other about the birth control pill.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font style="background-color: #ffffff" color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>Personhood amendment making inroads in Colorado<br /></em>Personhood Colorado is preparing for a major effort to get a proposed pro-life amendment on an upcoming ballot.&#160; <br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=324&amp;L=2212&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">http://www.onenewsnow.com/Culture/Default.aspx?id=638268</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4"><em>Denver archbishop: "Common ground" claim will be tested in details of health care reform<br /></em>Whether or not the White House and Congress are really seeking to find common ground on health care reform legislation will be discovered in the details of the plan put forth, Archbishop Charles Chaput said, warning against any attempts to place an abortion mandate in the reform bills.<br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=324&amp;L=2220&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=97074</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4"><em>Obama on abortion: Unclear now, quite clear then<br /></em>The White House unveiled its new Reality Check webpage, attempting to realign facts in its favor about the proposed nationalized health care plan.

This bill creates a platform for assisted suicide for the elderly, infirm and disabled at times they are most vulnerable, depressed and open to suggestions of ending their lives early. Compassion &amp; Choices, the former Hemlock Society, wants to get into the end-of-life counseling business, and it looks like the health-care bill will open the door for them to become government contractors as purveyors of the culture of death.<br /><br />
The legislative language of the bill regarding counseling is vague and open to interpretation. I'm a lawyer, and I find this language incomprehensible, stated Wesley J. Smith, associate director of the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide. â€œI believe it is done maliciously. What is clear is that seniors will receive counseling&#160; read re-education every five years or whenever their health status changes. The point is to reduce cost. While the language doesn't require it, these mandatory sessions will often be directed towards not wanting care, in much the same way that genetic counseling of a mother carrying a Down [syndrome] fetus often is directed toward abortion.<br /><br />
Smith said patients could be referred to organizations like the assisted suicide advocacy group Compassion &amp; Choices to help sort out their choices. â€œIn practice, if not in law, counseling will usually be a one-way street, he said.<br /><br />

Concerns about Obama's health-care reform adversely affecting older Americans are not new. Earlier this year, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Stimulus Bill) appropriated $1.1 billion for research into comparative effectiveness, which compares clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medical treatments, procedures and strategies. One aspect of this comparison is a concept called Quality Adjusted Life Years, where the value assigned to life varies with the health state of the person. This method is controversial because it means that some people will not receive treatment if the calculated cost is not warranted by the benefit to their quality of life.<br /><br />
Burke Balch, director of the Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics at the National Right to Life Committee, explained that a person's Quality of Adjusted Life Years determines if a procedure is allowed. Of significant concern is the phrase comparative effectiveness, he said. This becomes [how] you end up discriminating against a disability. The language in the health-care bills being considered by the House and reported out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee can be used for wide-open interpretation of cost-effectiveness leading to denial of treatment based on quality of life.

Thank you for taking a moment to read my e-mail.<br /><br />
I listened to your conversation last Friday evening with Raymond Arroyo and Judie Brown. There is one aspect of your argument regarding health care for pregnant women that I would like to address. It concerns an implied generalization that free prenatal care would greatly diminish abortions in our country.<br /><br />
I am a volunteer consultant at a crisis pregnancy center in Columbus, Ohio. Since 2001, I have talked with hundreds of abortion-minded women concerning their pregnancy and their options. It has been my experience that women do not choose to have an abortion because of lack of prenatal care. In our state, we have a generous, free health insurance program (called Healthy Start/Healthy Families) for women without insurance. The guidelines for eligibility are well above the Medicaid guidelines given by the federal government. In fact, any women in our state ineligible for state insurance can receive quality prenatal care for free (or at a substantially reduced rate) because there are other programs available to these women through grant money.<br /><br />
My experience has been that women choose abortion because they do not want to be pregnant. This might sound overly simplified, but let me explain. Many teens and adults are engaging in premarital sex. Most of them do not want children with that partner or at that moment in their life. Consequently, when they do get pregnant, they seek an abortion. Since abortion is legal and easy to acquire, it is a choice so often made. Many women choose to abort in the first trimester because they are not showing yet. Trust me, if all they needed were health care, we would have very few abortions in our state. (We have approximately 31,000 elective abortions each year.)<br /><br />
I can state at least 10 reasons that are given as to why they choose an abortion (notice that health care is <em>not</em> on the list):</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 80px"><strong><font size="4">&#160;1. Birth control failed&#160; pill, patch, shot, condom<br />
&#160;2. Wants to finish high school/college baby messes up their future plans<br />
&#160;3. No longer in a relationship with the father of the baby<br />
&#160;4. Parents would be unsupportive afraid of what they might think&#160; doesn't want&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;them to&#160;find out.&#160;<br />
&#160;5. Has enough kids<br />
&#160;6. Pregnant through an extramarital affair<br />
&#160;7. Not ready to parent no particular reason given<br />
&#160;8. Does not know who the father is casual sex (hooking&#160; up)&#160;with multiple partners<br />
&#160;9. Pressure from someone else to abort (family, boyfriend, employer)<br />
10. Sex is purely recreational I never thought I'd get pregnant!</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Women never tell us, Gee, I wouldn't have an abortion if I could get free health care. They know they can get free health care. <em>It's not about health care it's about the devaluing of human life in our culture, and most of the responsibility lies in the fact that abortions have been legal since 1973</em> [emphasis added]. Please do not be duped into this lie about abortion and health care. The only way to stop it is to make it illegal and teach â€œabstinence-only in our homes, our churches and our schools.<br /><br />
Now I must say that some of the poorest of the poor do not get abortions, because they cannot pay for them (a first-trimester abortion runs about $350 in our city). So, if health care passes that includes free abortions (a.k.a. family planning services), then even these women will succumb to the culture of death.<br /><br />
If you have any independent studies (not by Planned Parenthood) that corroborate your claim, please send them to me, so that I can read them.<br /><br />
If abortion were illegal, then the choice to abort would change to the choice of an adoption and occasionally to parenting. In our current climate, abortion is an easy option for now (or so they think!) because no one will know that I was ever pregnant.<br /><br />
If it were just as simple as giving them free health care, there would be no use for crisis pregnancy centers. I would happily give up my position here if it were all true, but I know better. I encourage you to visit a crisis center in your state and talk one-on-one with the consultants for more in-depth conversation.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">There it is, from an expert. This woman has given us a window into the world of the expectant mother who does not wish to be the mother of a living child. I would hasten to add that most of these mothers do not consider themselves to be the mother of a preborn child, but prefer to think of themselves as a woman with a problem requiring a quick solution. I also believe that this counselor is correct to point out that if abortion is covered in any health care reform plan, abortion numbers will go through the roof. So why hasn't this been made clear?<br /><br />
First and foremost, pro-life America <em>is</em> making the case, and we are not going to shut up. And it is my opinion that, after all these weeks of debate, perhaps the truth is sinking in. Perhaps Americans are finally beginning to think beyond the Obamacare marketing phrases, gobbledygook and false promises making their way through town-hall meetings and other such venues. <br /><br />
On this subject the facts about abortion-minded mothers it is my sincere hope that people across this nation will spread the words of this wise pro-life pregnancy counselor, and help their ministers, priests, bishops and others see that Obamacare is going to increase the killing of the preborn, not ameliorate the situation.<br /><br />

From <em>Handbook on Population</em> by Robert Sassone</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">World population growth is caused by more people being born than are dying. Before 1800, there was slow population growth with high birth rates but also high death rates. After 1800, the death rate declined and people lived longer in more developed countries. After about 1945, the technologies that had previously helped people in the developed countries (like antibiotics and DDT) spread throughout the world helping people on all of the continents to live longer. Even though fertility (the average number of children born to each woman) declined, substantial population growth occurred due to the greater number of older people. Population growth peaked about 1979 then grew at a lesser rate as fertility continued to decline.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Substantial population decline usually follows a fertility decline that has fallen below replacement level by about twenty to thirty years. That is the time it takes for the earlier fertility decline to substantially reduce the number of women of child bearing years in the next generation. Replacement level is 2.1 children born per woman, so that the average woman has one daughter.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Fertility in developed countries began to fall around 1960 and fell below replacement level about 1975. Births in the developed countries began declining about 1965 and throughout the world about 1985.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Every two years, the UN Population Division publishes World Population Prospects which projects population levels throughout the world in the coming years. During the early 1990’s, the UNPD assumed that the fertility rate in countries having below replacement fertility rates would somehow increase them. This has not happened.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">There are about 25 factors that substantially influence fertility rates. During recent decades, each and every one of these factors has acted to reduce fertility rates.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Some of the factors caused by modern life that reduce fertility include:</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Urbanization – children cannot work at early ages and do not make the family more prosperous as they would in the countryside, so the fertility rate declines.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Female education – women who pursue advanced education have their first child at an older age and, because of competing priorities, have fewer children after beginning child bearing.&#160; Additionally, a higher percentage of more educated women never marry.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Lower child mortality – in most countries, there is no old age income so most elderly must be supported by their children, typically sons. To ensure that one has a son who survives, it is prudent to actually have two or three. As child mortality declines, it becomes less necessary to have several sons.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Female job opportunities outside the home – women employed outside the home tend to have responsibilities, opportunities and distractions that decrease factors that might otherwise lead them to have more children.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;A desire for more material things – more people opt for the material rewards that more money brings instead of the non-material and emotional rewards of parenthood.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">•&#160;Government programs – many developing country governments act to reduce births because of a fear of runaway population growth or pressure from the World Bank, UN agencies (UNFPA), the US Government, well-funded pressure groups such as Planned Parenthood, media manipulation and others. </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Despite having spent billions of dollars in research, studies, subsidies to parents and even legislation, no country has been unable to increase its fertility permanently to replacement level.&#160; These massive failed efforts show that, at the present time, it is either impossible to increase fertility back to replacement level or that we do not know how.&#160; </font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The new UNPD system of projecting has reduced the world population projection for the year 2050 by about 400 million people.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Next month:&#160; Species extinction</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>American health care reform - A good end does not justify evil means<br /></em>All persons of good will need to understand the clear and present danger with which the U.S. is being menaced by the health reform proposed by the Obama Administration.

From <span style="font-style: italic">Parent Power!!</span> By Jim Sedlak</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Last month we began a look at the basic philosophies of Planned Parenthood as they relate to the subjects taught in typical Family Life Education programs.&#160; Our source for determining these philosophies is a book entitled <span style="font-style: italic">How to Talk with Your Child About Sexuality</span> which was written by Faye Wattleton while she was president of Planned Parenthood (Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., Garden City, New York; copyright 1986 Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.).</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">As previously noted, the stated intent of this book (page 5) is to provide parents with information on the subject of sexuality so that parents can become “the best source” of information for their children. The book then proceeds to offer information on a variety topics concerning sexuality. Of particular interest is some of the information provided in Chapter 7, “The Top Seven Questions.”&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">In addition to puberty, intercourse and pregnancy which we discussed earlier, no sane person would expect Planned Parenthood to write a book about sexuality without a strong pitch for birth control. After all, it is their main business. The title of this section of the book is very revealing, however, because the chief aim of Planned Parenthood is to control births, not prevent pregnancies. This is illustrated on page 180 of the Appendix where abortion is listed along with the IUD, the pill and other forms of birth control as a method of “fertility control.” The book strongly recommends that parents talk to their teenagers and help them acquire birth control devices.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Planned Parenthood gives lip service to the real problem of sending confusing messages to the children. The confusing message comes from saying that they should not engage in sexual intercourse but then giving them birth control devices “in case they do.”&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Planned Parenthood always rejects any discussion of morals and you will find none in this book. God is never mentioned and religious values are only given passing mention on the way to making Planned Parenthood’s own case. On page 86, the reader will find the following statement:</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">“If parents do not want their children to become pregnant or to make someone pregnant while they are teenagers, they must give them information about contraception and, by so doing, give them permission to use it when they have sex.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Notice, it’s not “if” they have sex, but “when” they have sex. This illustrates the basic philosophy of Planned Parenthood, which is that all kids are going to have sex anyway, so we might as well accept that fact and stop them from getting pregnant. According to Planned Parenthood, it’s getting pregnant that is the major problem, not engaging in promiscuous sexual behavior at 15 years of age!&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Another of Planned Parenthood’s “Top Seven” involves sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This section of the book gives a basic description of STDs and some of the effects. Along with the appendix, it contains some good scientific information on the diseases. Not once in this section, however, is it ever mentioned that the existence of STDs and their prevalence among sexually active teens is a strong case for remaining chaste. Parents are not encouraged to use this information in an attempt to dissuade their teens from having sex. Rather, parents are encouraged to talk about STDs with their kids and to let them know that “it is easy to get medical treatment for STDs.”</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">What does one expect from an organization that makes a great deal of money from the sale of birth control devices – and from an organization whose president was quoted in the <span style="font-style: italic">Los Angeles Times</span> in 1987 as stating that Planned Parenthood “will not be an organization that promotes chastity”?&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">It is not in Planned Parenthood’s financial interest to encourage children not to have sex and this is seen repeatedly throughout all of its programs. As soon as the general public grasps this one fact, Planned Parenthood’s days will be numbered.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">And that is why we fight …</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4">Next month:&#160; School Districts 4 and 5</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="5">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="4"><em>The Pill and the debt<br /></em>It was probably a Freudian slip.

But when it comes to Obamacare, I'm afraid a 10-pound bag full of sugar isn't really going to matter.

And in this case, despite the denials and personal attacks on upstanding Americans such as Sarah Palin, the truth is getting out, and then some.<br /><br />
Obamacare's Trojan horse, known in some circles, as the â€œdeath panel provision, is Obama's Achilles heel. Even though those pesky â€œdeath panel discussions have taken a turn, not all of us are convinced. Some Americans actually think that just because the Senate has announced that the panels are coming out of its version of </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2354&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obamacare</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;we should all heave a sigh of relief and go on about our business. After all, folks, they would argue, don't we all know how sincerely these men and women in the U.S. Congress care about the views of average Americans like you and me and how they are always looking out for us? Well â€¦<br /><br />
For those of us who live in the real world, the news out of Washington that those panels are allegedly gone is nothing to get excited about. What the Senate took out is a reference to advance care planning consultations. The Senate has not removed references to the Independent Medicare Advisory Commission, nor has it finalized any piece of legislation. As we have learned over the years, what was there yesterday and appears to be gone today could come back in a different form tomorrow. It's sort of like a chameleon; the lizard changes color to adapt to its surroundings.<br /><br />
But there's a little more to this story than a </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2356&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sarah Palin</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> versus Barack Obama debate. As Palin wrote on her Facebook page,&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their â€œlevel of productivity in society,whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2348&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Sowell</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">, to whom Palin refers, is a wise man who opined,&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">An old advertising slogan said, "Progress is our most important product." With politicians, confusion is their most important product. They confuse bringing down the price of medical care with bringing down the cost. And they confuse medical care with health care.<br /><br />
Nothing is easier than for governments to impose price controls. They have been doing this, off and on, for thousands of years â€“ repeatedly resulting in (1) shortages, (2) quality deterioration and (3) black markets. Why would anyone want any of those things when it comes to medical care?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">And this is precisely where Palin is going with her reference to â€œdeath panels and the vulnerable.

But don't take my word for it. Just yesterday, the <em>Washington Times</em> published an article written by attorney Robert W. Painter, who handles medical malpractice matters and testified before the Texas legislature on that state's </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=332&amp;L=2359&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Advance Directives</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> Act of 1999. In Death Panels exist already, Painter writes about what has occurred as a direct result of the Act becoming law. And he warns that what has happened in Texas is a harbinger of what could happen nationwide if the Obama proposal moves forward. The results in Texas have been devastating for families.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The end-of-life provisions of the Obama health care plan would upset the balance of power in health care decision-making in favor of doctors and hospitals and against individuals and families. The federal legislation provides an economic incentive for doctors and hospital administrators to use Medicare funds to start hastening certain patient deaths a bit sooner under existing state laws. In Texas, that balance already is tipped in favor of the health care providers, and the proposed federal legislation would only make matters worse by placing more Medicare dollars on that side of the scale.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican, is rightly concerned that the end-of-life provisions in the proposed federal law could be "misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly." Federal lawmakers interested in protecting individual and patient rights need to study carefully the end-of-life provisions with the understanding that the law will be implemented in health care settings governed under 50 different sets of state law.<br /><br />
Admittedly, the warning of "death panels" is a shocking claim. But when I inform people of the effect of the Texas law and how it has trampled on individual rights, they are understandably shocked. If the Texas Advance Directives Act has shown us anything, it is that governments should leave end-of-life decisions to patients and their families.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">It occurs to me that President Obama's rush to impose his prescription for health care reform on the nation is riddled through and through with problems. But at the core of it all, the real question is why should the federal government be regulating medical practices as a way of cutting costs?&#160;<br /><br />

The relationship at issue, then, was doctor-patient, not husband-wife. Yet Douglas framed his opinion around a presumed right to marital privacy. He expounded at length about the sanctity of marriage but used vague phrasing to describe the rights at issue, never explicitly stating that married couples have a right to use contraceptives. He even raised the ugly specter of sex police, though no police had intruded into anyone's bedroom. â€œWould we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?

The urban legends he has told to garner support for the march towards socialism are finally losing their traction.<br /><br />
You could hear the sound of screeching brakes all over America at the collision between an elite Harvard professor and a president making a racial incident out of a police officer's response to a 911 call&#160; and the government takeover of health care. America is coming out of the trance.<br /><br />
As a warrior in the trenches, I couldn't count the number of times prayer mercenaries have transformed a blunder into a period of grace. Catholics had better take full advantage of the reprieve. We have a lot to lose in the ethical conundrums of rationing treatment and mercy in a government-controlled HMO.<br /><br />
The mission of providing ethical, compassionate, quality health care to the sick and poor is about to be reformed into setting criteria that determine the value of the patient's life measured against the cost of treating their illness.<br /><br />
The Church's teachings<br /><br />
Denying medical care to the poor, elderly and catastrophically ill to benefit the government is diametrically opposed to Catholic ethics and the Catholic animus. Pope Benedict XVI expounded on [t]he inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual as a <em>constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation</em> (<em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2284&amp;F=H">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></em>,&#160;Section 2273, emphasis in original) in his recently published encyclical, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=1724&amp;F=H">Caritas in Veritate</a></em>:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4"><em>Openness to life is at the centre of true development.</em> When a society moves towards the denial or suppression of life, it ends up no longer finding the necessary motivation and energy to strive for man's true good (Section 28, emphasis in original)<br /><br />
In order to protect nature, it is not enough to intervene with economic incentives or deterrents; not even an apposite education is sufficient. These are important steps, but <em>the decisive issue is the overall moral tenor of society</em>. If there is a lack of respect for the right to life and to a natural death, if human conception, gestation and birth are made artificial, if human embryos are sacrificed to research, the conscience of society ends up losing the concept of human ecology (Section 51, emphasis in original)<br /><br />
To the tragic and widespread scourge of abortion we may well have to add in the future indeed it is already surreptitiously present&#160; the systematic eugenic programming of births. At the other end of the spectrum, a pro-euthanasia mindset is making inroads as an equally damaging assertion of control over life that under certain circumstances is deemed no longer worth living. Underlying these scenarios are cultural viewpoints that deny human dignity. These practices in turn foster a materialistic and mechanistic understanding of human life. Who could measure the negative effects of this kind of mentality for development?... While the poor of the world continue knocking on the doors of the rich, the world of affluence runs the risk of no longer hearing those knocks, on account of a conscience that can no longer distinguish what is human. (Section 75)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Obama projects that giving access to our health care system to 50 million more people will cost Americans less money than it does now. In fact, at the breaking point, Obama claims his health care program will start paying for itself. Like his projections about the economy, writing off the debt of irresponsible people who caused the mortgage crisis, cash for clunkers and â€œracial profiling, Obama is, once again, way off the mark. <br />
You don't have to be a mathematician to figure out that giving access to 50 million more people in an already burdened health care system and spending less means the patients currently in the system will be sacrificing their present level of care and services. There have been negative impacts&#160;on health care access, cancer survival rates, and the quality of life for the elderly, learning disabled and sick in every country where there has been a government takeover of health care. Obama can't escape the laws of supply and demand. Supporting laws destined to place life-threatening hardships upon the disadvantaged and suffering is fundamentally immoral.<br /><br />
We've got to digest the threats to the sanctity of life and Catholic conscience protections, educate grassroots Catholics and make a lot of noise in the public square in the next several weeks. We're going to see Obama infomercials pushing overhaul in the mainstream media in the month of August, ad nauseam.

Stand up and fight.<br /><br />
The threat to the elderly<br /><br />
Reading the proposals, there is no doubt that seniors would pay a heavy price. The White House has proposed the creation of an independent panel to recommend Medicare and Medicaid cuts. Seniors would not only be losing benefits. From all indications, it appears that they would be losing control over life-and-death decisions and care. This is inhumane.<br /><br />
Last week, EWTN's </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2296&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Raymond Arroyo</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;put up a must-read post on his blog, raising the same concerns many have over disturbing references in the bill:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The elderly or people with catastrophic diseases are clearly in the sights of the administration and the congressional leadership for the simple reason that they cost too much. A quarter of all Medicare payments occur in the last year of life, costing the government more than 100 billion dollars a year, according to <em>Forbes Magazine</em>.<br /><br />
One troubling provision of the House bill compels seniors to submit to a counseling session every five years (and more often if they become sick or go into a nursing home) about alternatives for end-of-life care (House bill, p. 425-430). The sessions cover highly sensitive matters such as whether to receive antibiotics and the use of artificially administered nutrition and hydration.â€™ This mandate invites abuse, and seniors could easily be pushed to refuse care. [interview with Betsy McCaughey, patient advocate and former lieutenant governor of New York]<br /><br />
This Advance Care Planning Consultation would encourage all of us, but especially those with severe illnesses to submit to hospices rather than pursue expensive therapies that might extend life (and cost a bundle). The bill also establishes a tracking system to insure that doctors are advocating â€œadvance care directives where you predetermine what type of care you would accept or refuse at the end of life. The problem with all of this is it assigns a utilitarian value to human life. If you are too old or disabled, there will be a built-in incentive to push you into hospice and palliative care rather than work to beat the disease.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">This isn't hype and hysteria from the fringe. Calm, credible people reading the bills are drawing these same conclusions across the board. Arm yourself with citations from the bill, go to senior centers in your hometown and educate them about the contents of the reforms. The mainstream media is not going to publish the truth, but there is nothing holding us back from doing a little â€œcommunity organizing of our own.<br /><br />
By their fruits, you will know them<br /><br />

The president has surrounded himself with radical pro-abortionists, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who will have a heavy hand of influence in shaping and executing policies. Catholics, other Christians and other decent people can't ignore the dangers of giving such people power over life, death and health. Educate your priests and those in your parish. With enlightenment on Obama's trajectory, the health care bill will take on a new patina.<br /><br />
The Massachusetts experience<br /><br />
Catholics should be outraged that the poor are being used and exploited by the White House to swindle them out of benefits and life itself. Catholics United, Catholic Charities and other social pirates who are propagating the myth that this type of health care reform is about service to the poor should be vigorously castigated. The poor already have health coverage in combined federal- and state- subsidized programs. (For example, in Massachusetts, there is </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2290&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">MassHealth</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160; Medicaid and SCHIP.)<br /><br />
In </font></strong><a target="_top" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2289&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Massachusetts</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">,&#160;where health care reform was instituted in 2007, benefits have been siphoned off from the indigent and transferred to households earning $77,400 for a family of five. For a family of eight, the household income can be up to $111,080. But families earning $30,000, previously eligible for free health care, are burdened with premiums and co-payments costing nearly $10,000 for the least expensive plan.<br /><br />
In fact, in early July, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2287&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Boston Medical Center</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;(formerly known as Boston City Hospital, serving the poorest of the poor in Boston) filed a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The suit says the hospital will lose more than $100 million next year because the state has lowered Medicaid reimbursement rates and stopped paying Boston Medical â€œreasonable costs for treating other poor patients.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">We filed this suit more in sorrow than in anger, said Elaine Ullian, the hospital's chief executive. â€œWe believe in health care reform to the bottom of our toes, but it was never, ever supposed to be financed on the backs of the poor, and that's what has happened in Massachusetts.<br /><br />
The central charge in the suit is that the state has siphoned money away from Boston Medical to help pay the considerable cost of insuring all but a small percentage of residents.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">According to the suit, Massachusetts is now reimbursing Boston Medical only 64 cents for every dollar it spends treating the poor. About 10 percent of the hospital's patients are uninsured down from about 20 percent before the law's passage in 2006. But many more are on Medicaid or Commonwealth Care, the state-subsidized insurance program for low-income residents.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Astoundingly, with all the rancor and rhetoric from Democrats about the compassionate immigration policies absent in the Republican agenda, when the cost of operating â€œ</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2288&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">health care reform</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;produced an ever-growing deficit, 30,000 legal immigrants were the first people thrown under the bus by the Democrat-controlled Massachusetts legislature: 30,000 of them received letters of health care termination.<br /><br />

A vote on July 29 restored $40 million of the budget, leaving uncertainty about the effect of eliminating $90 million in coverage for permanent residents&#160;who have had green cards for less than five years.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's former senior adviser, provided an informed analysis of the siphoning off of funds from the poor:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Mr. Obama's problem is that nine out of 10 Americans would likely get worse health care if </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2302&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">ObamaCare</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;goes through. Of those who do not have insurance â€“ and who therefore might be better off approximately one-fifth are illegal aliens, nearly three-fifths make $50,000 or more a year and can afford insurance, and just under a third are probably eligible for Medicaid or other government programs already.<br /><br />

There are valuable lessons to be learned from the Catholic trenches in Boston in terms of what lies ahead nationally. In late February of this year, the </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=1174&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Caritas Christi</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;health care delivery network sought and was awarded a contract that includes providing abortions, family planning services and other moral evils to the uncatechized, the unsuspecting poor and women emotionally distraught due to an unplanned pregnancy.<br /><br />
With the advice and public consent of Boston's Cardinal Sean O'Malley, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=1141&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Caritas</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;gave the Commonwealth written assurances that Catholic medical staff would inform women of health care options, including abortions. They appointed NARAL members to serve as advisors and agreed to give them access to monitor Catholic health care workers to ensure compliance.<br /><br />
Caritas set up a corporation, sought out and signed contracts with abortionists, set up a 24-hour family planning/abortion hotline number and hired employees to direct women to the abortionists with whom it contracted and took a 49-percent interest in the operation. A handful of Catholics relentlessly exposed the arrangement and, with some assistance from American Life League, we were able to get&#160;Cardinal </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2285&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">O'Malley</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> to retreat from ownership in the operation.&#160;However, the arrangement marched forward with all the abortion contracts, the 24-hour hotline, written assurances and NARAL oversight of Caritas employees intact.<br /><br />
It should be noted that Cardinal O'Malley tried to generate support for the arrangement by purporting that Catholic theology permitted entering into a contract that binds a Catholic in the performance of moral evils; in effect, he claimed that even though we realize the sinful nature of performing those moral evils, so long as we recruit others to perform the evils, it does not violate Catholic ethics. Theologically, spiritually and ethically, nothing could be more unsound. Knowing something is wrong and sinful, and then baiting somebody else into doing it who doesn't know, compounds the sin. The Caritas arrangement is as ethical as hiring Kevorkian to kill your elderly parents when they become a personal and financial burden.<br /><br />
The cardinal outsourced his conscience to the National Catholic Bioethics Center, which reportedly gave him a formal opinion stating the current arrangement is ethically sound. Repeated requests to the cardinal to release the opinion of the NCBC have been rebuffed.<br /><br />
The <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=325&amp;L=2283&amp;F=H">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></em>&#160;is clear about those who give scandal by becoming their neighbor's tempter (Sections 2284 &amp; 2287).

CRR asserts that abortion providers should be recognized as "human rights defenders" because the targeting of abortion providers directly infringes on womenâ€™s fundamental human rights by restricting "womenâ€™s ability to realize their right to reproductive healthcare, including safe abortion."<br /><br />

So this thought came to mind one day.&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
A young woman finds herself living the typical college life: excited about her life to come and fearful of things that can go wrong. In school, she unexpectedly finds the man of her dreams and, although much in love, is panicked and fearful when she finds herself with child.&#160;She consults one of the many â€œfamily planning businesses, and its advice seems reasonable: Protect your college education; protect your future: </font></strong><strong><font size="4"><em>Have an abortion.<br /></em>&#160;<br />
The young woman pauses and again her family planning counselor says, <em>It's in your best interest; it's merely a fetus and of no consequence. </em>As she ponders such assurances from a counselor who seems so caring, a date is set. And then the procedure is performed.<br />
&#160;<br />
Years have now passed, guilt has faded and love has blossomed. The woman now finds herself in the deepest of love with the man of her dreams. They have a beautiful wedding with everyone there, their careers couldn't be better and their life is grand. A great surprise has come to the newly married couple: They have now conceived a child. The young married couple could never have guessed what joy there would be in planning for a first child. A room is chosen and furnished with love. An ultrasound suggests a blue room, and joy is the order of the day.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">One day, the couple decides that a slow walk in the park would be nice. But a thief lurks there in the shadows, waiting to carry out a robbery. Under a shady elm tree, he strikes. At gunpoint, he shouts, Give me your money! They pause; he becomes angry. Her young husband is heroic at heart, but is thrown to the ground. His young bride, still standing, bears the brunt of the thief's anger as a single, surreal pop sounds under the elm tree. The young bride stands there, desperately clutching her stomach.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;&#160;<br />
I end this short story here because here is where humanity takes control of the abortion debate. In life, a person chooses to be honest or not. They choose to follow the natural law "or not".</font></strong></p><p><em><strong><font size="4">Are you an honest person?</font></strong></em></p><p><strong><font size="4">When the young woman was in college, she was told that what was growing inside of her was just a piece of flesh a fetus of no consequence.<br />
&#160;<br /></font></strong><strong><font size="4"><em>When she was struck by the thief's bullet, did she cry out, My fetus, my fetus! or My baby, my baby!?<br /></em>&#160;<br />

In its <em>Monday Update</em> last week, Pro-Life Wisconsin published a timely reminder of exactly what the “no exceptions pro-life philosophy” means. It is our pleasure to reprint it here for you:</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Compassionate and Consistent:&#160; The “No-Exceptions” Pro-Life Philosophy</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Totally banning abortion makes some people uncomfortable. We’ve been told time and again there are unique situations for which abortion is the best option. If a lie is repeated often enough, people begin to accept it as truth. Such is the case with the erroneous notion that abortion must be permitted in cases of rape, incest, fetal deformity, or a perceived threat to the mother’s life. A principled commitment to the protection of innocent human life, in all circumstances and at all stages of development, is compassionate and consistent.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Not even in the case of rape or incest? Rape and incest are both criminal acts, and in our system of justice we punish the criminal. We do not punish the victim, nor do we punish the criminal’s children. We are told that if a pregnancy results from an act of rape or incest, the compassionate response is to offer the traumatized woman an abortion. No woman should be “forced to carry that monster’s child,” we are told. The trauma of sexual assault is very real. But why compound such severe trauma with the additional trauma of abortion? The compassionate response to rape and incest is to meet the real needs of the mother. Providing life-affirming medical, financial, and emotional care meets these needs.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Not even in cases of fetal deformity? When abortion is used to solve the problem of a disability, it is discrimination of the most severe kind. These children are not merely discriminated against for their disability; they are killed because of it. Abortions in these cases raise frightening prospects, for if it is right to kill a disabled person in the womb, could it not someday be permissible to kill a disabled infant? A disabled adult? The answer is clearly “no” in those cases; why is there any question when the victim is a child in the womb? Preborn children diagnosed with disabilities deserve to be treated with the same respect as people born with or without a disability.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Not even in the case of a perceived threat to the mother’s life? Medical operations such as the removal of a cancerous uterus or the removal of an ectopic pregnancy are moral even under Catholic teaching and are not considered abortions. Such operations are justified by the “principle of double effect,” because the death of the child is an unintended effect of an operation independently justified to save the mother’s life. They do not involve the intentional and willful destruction of an unborn child. Physicians must make their best effort to save both patients, giving equal care to mother and child. They should never be given a license to intentionally kill either of them. Finally, many abortionists believe the very condition of pregnancy itself is a life-threatening condition. Consequently, a “life of the mother” exception can become a massive statutory loophole through which to drive abortion on demand.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">When those in the pro-life movement support abortion in exceptional cases, it is destructive to the whole movement. The point is to end ALL abortion. The child is ALWAYS an innocent victim. Once pro-lifers say there can be a “good reason” to kill a preborn baby, the foundation of the pro-life movement crumbles. The argument is lost. Either the preborn child is a person, or the child is not a person. Since the preborn child is a person, there can be no exceptions for abortion.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4">Fast Facts and Frequently Asked Questions</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><em><strong><font size="4">Editor's note: In addition to our ongoing monthly features addressing specific topics of interest to the pro-life community (the culture of life, Planned Parenthood, population control, etc.), our new feature, "Fast Facts and Frequently Asked Questions," will highlight some of the most frequently quoted and sought-after facts and statistics pertaining to pro-life matters, as well as answer some of the questions most frequently asked of our office (and probably yours too).

It is extremely dishonest to promote the theory that the pill curtails abortion per se when, in fact, the pill can and does work in three different ways, one of which is abortion. When the pill works by thinning the lining of the uterus, the embryonic child dies and this is known as an early chemical abortion. Therefore, to suggest that the pill "keeps abortions from happening" is not accurate.<br />
&#160;<br />
Further, the birth control pill is known to be carcinogenic and can cause a series of health problems for women and their future children. It has been linked to cancer, heart conditions, thromboembolisms and more. Moreover, it has now been found to have negative effects on the environment, particularly oceans and rivers.<br />
&#160;<br />
There is a great deal of research available on this subject, and we strongly recommend that individuals conduct an independent study of the literature on the pill. A good starting point is The Pill Kills web site (</font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=324&amp;L=1035&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">www.thepillkills.com</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">). The material that we cite is of exactly the same nature as the material cited by pill advocates. Obviously, each side emphasizes the facts according to its own perspective, so we are not guilty of anything unique when it comes to discussing or debating the birth control pill.&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
We have never believed it is compassionate to deceive people by only telling them what they want to hear. There are cruel facts about the birth control pill that rarely see the light of day. It is our responsibility to make sure we provide this information through our educational outreach, so that, regardless of one’s opinion, he or she has all the facts before making a decision one way or the other about the birth control pill.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font style="background-color: #ffffff" color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>Personhood amendment making inroads in Colorado<br /></em>Personhood Colorado is preparing for a major effort to get a proposed pro-life amendment on an upcoming ballot.&#160; <br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=324&amp;L=2212&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">http://www.onenewsnow.com/Culture/Default.aspx?id=638268</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4"><em>Denver archbishop: "Common ground" claim will be tested in details of health care reform<br /></em>Whether or not the White House and Congress are really seeking to find common ground on health care reform legislation will be discovered in the details of the plan put forth, Archbishop Charles Chaput said, warning against any attempts to place an abortion mandate in the reform bills.<br /></font></strong><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=324&amp;L=2220&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=97074</font></strong></a></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font size="4"><em>Obama on abortion: Unclear now, quite clear then<br /></em>The White House unveiled its new Reality Check webpage, attempting to realign facts in its favor about the proposed nationalized health care plan.

At issue is a provision that calls for end-of-life counseling of senior citizens every five years. That counseling can include topics such as how to decline nutrition and hydration, antibiotics and basic care treatments for specific conditions such as flu or pneumonia, and how to choose palliative and hospice care for the terminally ill.<br /><br />
I've read about a third of HR 3200 and the counseling parts are designed to encourage euthanasia, claimed Dr. Katherine Schlaerth, an associate professor of family medicine at Loma Linda University School of Medicine. Seniors will be counseled every five years, and more often if they get sicker.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Schlaerth, who emphasized that she does not speak for Loma Linda University, said that a frail, elderly, ill and depressed patient or that patient's family â€œmay easily agree to withhold antibiotics or fluid without realizing the full implication.<br /><br />
Patients who have a worsening of their chronic condition, but who may not even be pre-terminal, are included in this strong-arm counseling, and their respect for authority figures could pave the way for agreement with cessation of care not in their interest at all, Schlaerth said. Health-care providers, meanwhile, may be forced to give counseling directly opposed to their religious or moral beliefs.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Key lawmakers are in agreement with Schlaerth. Section 1233 encourages health-care providers to provide their Medicare patients with counseling on the use of artificially administered nutrition and hydration and other end-of-life treatments and may place seniors in situations where they feel pressure to sign an end-of-life directive they would not otherwise sign, said the House Republican leader, John Boehner, R-Ohio, and the Republican Policy Committee chairman, Thaddeus McCotter, R-Mich., in a July 23 statement. â€œThis provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Death as Cost Savings<br />
At first glance, the counseling of elders for care options seems like an innocuous requirement. But Schlaerth says the purpose of the counseling has darker roots.<br /><br />
The real reason for these draconian provisions directed against elders who are not terminal, I believe, is to save on Social Security payments as well as Medicare payments, Schlaerth said. The math is obvious. If you kill the disabled and give quality preventive care to the well, your health-care statistics will look excellent.<br /><br />
Bill May, chairman of Catholics for the Common Good, also views the mandatory counseling sessions as an outrageous cover to introduce assisted suicide.<br /><br />
We need to pay attention to issues related to shortening the lives and hastening death for the elderly, infirm and disabled another way of getting rid of undesirable, non-useful and costly people, he said. This bill creates a platform for assisted suicide for the elderly, infirm and disabled at times they are most vulnerable, depressed and open to suggestions of ending their lives early. Compassion &amp; Choices, the former Hemlock Society, wants to get into the end-of-life counseling business, and it looks like the health-care bill will open the door for them to become government contractors as purveyors of the culture of death.<br /><br />
The legislative language of the bill regarding counseling is vague and open to interpretation. I'm a lawyer, and I find this language incomprehensible, stated Wesley J. Smith, associate director of the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide. â€œI believe it is done maliciously. What is clear is that seniors will receive counseling&#160; read re-education every five years or whenever their health status changes. The point is to reduce cost. While the language doesn't require it, these mandatory sessions will often be directed towards not wanting care, in much the same way that genetic counseling of a mother carrying a Down [syndrome] fetus often is directed toward abortion.<br /><br />
Smith said patients could be referred to organizations like the assisted suicide advocacy group Compassion &amp; Choices to help sort out their choices. â€œIn practice, if not in law, counseling will usually be a one-way street, he said.<br /><br />
Compassion &amp; Choices is an organization that describes itself as working to improve care and expand choice at the end of life. Wesley J. Smith says the bill is˜incomprehensible, which may explain why he repeatedly misstates what the bill does, said Steve Hopcraft, a spokesman for Compassion &amp; Choices. It's a myth that C&amp;C or any organization [would] be the counselor. The bill specifically says M.D. or nurse practitioner.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Section 1233 does state the consultation will be performed by a medical provider; however, included in the topics to be discussed is direction to provide suggested people to talk to and a list of national and state-specific resources.<br /></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Rationed Care <br />
Concerns about Obama's health-care reform adversely affecting older Americans are not new. Earlier this year, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Stimulus Bill) appropriated $1.1 billion for research into comparative effectiveness, which compares clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medical treatments, procedures and strategies. One aspect of this comparison is a concept called Quality Adjusted Life Years, where the value assigned to life varies with the health state of the person. This method is controversial because it means that some people will not receive treatment if the calculated cost is not warranted by the benefit to their quality of life.<br /><br />
Burke Balch, director of the Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics at the National Right to Life Committee, explained that a person's Quality of Adjusted Life Years determines if a procedure is allowed. Of significant concern is the phrase comparative effectiveness, he said. This becomes [how] you end up discriminating against a disability. The language in the health-care bills being considered by the House and reported out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee can be used for wide-open interpretation of cost-effectiveness leading to denial of treatment based on quality of life. The funding for the promises made in these bills cannot be sustained, and that will create the atmosphere for rationing.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">May agrees and says that health-care rationing takes place in Oregon, one of two states where physician-assisted suicide is legal.

At issue is a provision that calls for end-of-life counseling of senior citizens every five years. That counseling can include topics such as how to decline nutrition and hydration, antibiotics and basic care treatments for specific conditions such as flu or pneumonia, and how to choose palliative and hospice care for the terminally ill.<br /><br />
I've read about a third of HR 3200 and the counseling parts are designed to encourage euthanasia, claimed Dr. Katherine Schlaerth, an associate professor of family medicine at Loma Linda University School of Medicine. Seniors will be counseled every five years, and more often if they get sicker.<br /><br />
Schlaerth, who emphasized that she does not speak for Loma Linda University, said that a frail, elderly, ill and depressed patient or that patient's family may easily agree to withhold antibiotics or fluid without realizing the full implication.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><br />
Patients who have a worsening of their chronic condition, but who may not even be pre-terminal, are included in this strong-arm counseling, and their respect for authority figures could pave the way for agreement with cessation of care not in their interest at all, Schlaerth said. Health-care providers, meanwhile, may be forced to give counseling directly opposed to their religious or moral beliefs.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Key lawmakers are in agreement with Schlaerth. Section 1233 encourages health-care providers to provide their Medicare patients with counseling on the use of artificially administered nutrition and hydration and other end-of-life treatments and may place seniors in situations where they feel pressure to sign an end-of-life directive they would not otherwise sign, said the House Republican leader, John Boehner, R-Ohio, and the Republican Policy Committee chairman, Thaddeus McCotter, R-Mich., in a July 23 statement. â€œThis provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><br />
Death as Cost Savings<br />
At first glance, the counseling of elders for care options seems like an innocuous requirement. But Schlaerth says the purpose of the counseling has darker roots.<br /><br />
The real reason for these draconian provisions directed against elders who are not terminal, I believe, is to save on Social Security payments as well as Medicare payments, Schlaerth said. The math is obvious. If you kill the disabled and give quality preventive careâ€™ to the well, your health-care statistics will look excellent.<br />
Bill May, chairman of Catholics for the Common Good, also views the mandatory counseling sessions as an outrageous cover to introduce assisted suicide.<br /><br />
We need to pay attention to issues related to shortening the lives and hastening death for the elderly, infirm and disabled another way of getting rid of undesirable, non-useful and costly people, he said. This bill creates a platform for assisted suicide for the elderly, infirm and disabled at times they are most vulnerable, depressed and open to suggestions of ending their lives early. Compassion &amp; Choices, the former Hemlock Society, wants to get into the end-of-life counseling business, and it looks like the health-care bill will open the door for them to become government contractors as purveyors of the culture of death.<br />
The legislative language of the bill regarding counseling is vague and open to interpretation. I'm a lawyer, and I find this language incomprehensible, stated Wesley J. Smith, associate director of the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide. â€œI believe it is done maliciously. What is clear is that seniors will receive counseling&#160; read re-educationâ every five years or whenever their health status changes. The point is to reduce cost. While the language doesn't require it, these mandatory sessions will often be directed towards not wanting care, in much the same way that genetic counseling of a mother carrying a Down [syndrome] fetus often is directed toward abortion.<br /><br />
Smith said patients could be referred to organizations like the assisted suicide advocacy group Compassion &amp; Choices to help sort out their choices. In practice, if not in law, ˜counseling will usually be a one-way street, he said.<br /><br />
Compassion &amp; Choices is an organization that describes itself as working to improve care and expand choice at the end of life. Wesley J. Smith says the bill is incomprehensible, which may explain why he repeatedly misstates what the bill does, said Steve Hopcraft, a spokesman for Compassion &amp; Choices. It's a myth that C&amp;C or any organization [would] be the counselor. The bill specifically says M.D. or nurse practitioner.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Section 1233 does state the consultation will be performed by a medical provider; however, included in the topics to be discussed is direction to provide suggested people to talk to and â€œa list of national and state-specific resources.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><br /></font></strong><strong><font size="4">Rationed Care <br />
Concerns about Obama's health-care reform adversely affecting older Americans are not new. Earlier this year, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the â€œStimulus Bill) appropriated $1.1 billion for research into comparative effectiveness, which compares clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medical treatments, procedures and strategies. One aspect of this comparison is a concept called Quality Adjusted Life Years, where the value assigned to life varies with the health state of the person. This method is controversial because it means that some people will not receive treatment if the calculated cost is not warranted by the benefit to their quality of life.<br /><br />
Burke Balch, director of the Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics at the National Right to Life Committee, explained that a person's Quality of Adjusted Life Years determines if a procedure is allowed. Of significant concern is the phrase comparative effectiveness, he said. This becomes [how] you end up discriminating against a disability. The language in the health-care bills being considered by the House and reported out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee can be used for wide-open interpretation of cost-effectiveness leading to denial of treatment based on quality of life. The funding for the promises made in these bills cannot be sustained, and that will create the atmosphere for rationing.<br />
May agrees and says that health-care rationing takes place in Oregon, one of two states where physician-assisted suicide is legal. People fighting life-threatening illnesses there regularly receive letters saying that the state insurance plan would not cover their medication but would pay for a lethal prescription to end their lives, he said.<br /><br />
Boehner and McCotter also warn that with Oregon and Washington having legalized assisted suicide, Section 1233 could create a slippery slope for a more permissive environment for euthanasia, mercy killing and physician-assisted suicide because it does not clearly exclude counseling about the supposed benefits of killing oneself.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Robin Rohr is a <em>National Catholic Register</em> correspondent and writes from Willits, California.</font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><font size="5">Pro-Life Today | 05 August 2009</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><u><font color="#ff0000">HEADLINES</font><br /></u></span><br />

Thank you for taking a moment to read my e-mail.<br /><br />
I listened to your conversation last Friday evening with Raymond Arroyo and Judie Brown. There is one aspect of your argument regarding health care for pregnant women that I would like to address. It concerns an implied generalization that free prenatal care would greatly diminish abortions in our country.<br /><br />
I am a volunteer consultant at a crisis pregnancy center in Columbus, Ohio. Since 2001, I have talked with hundreds of abortion-minded women concerning their pregnancy and their options. It has been my experience that women do not choose to have an abortion because of lack of prenatal care. In our state, we have a generous, free health insurance program (called Healthy Start/Healthy Families) for women without insurance. The guidelines for eligibility are well above the Medicaid guidelines given by the federal government. In fact, any women in our state ineligible for state insurance can receive quality prenatal care for free (or at a substantially reduced rate) because there are other programs available to these women through grant money.<br /><br />
My experience has been that women choose abortion because they do not want to be pregnant. This might sound overly simplified, but let me explain. Many teens and adults are engaging in premarital sex. Most of them do not want children with that partner or at that moment in their life. Consequently, when they do get pregnant, they seek an abortion. Since abortion is legal and easy to acquire, it is a choice so often made. Many women choose to abort in the first trimester because they are not showing yet. Trust me, if all they needed were health care, we would have very few abortions in our state. (We have approximately 31,000 elective abortions each year.)<br /><br />
I can state at least 10 reasons that are given as to why they choose an abortion (notice that health care is <em>not</em> on the list):</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 80px"><strong><font size="4">&#160;1. Birth control failed&#160; pill, patch, shot, condom<br />
&#160;2. Wants to finish high school/college baby messes up their future plans<br />
&#160;3. No longer in a relationship with the father of the baby<br />
&#160;4. Parents would be unsupportive afraid of what they might think&#160; doesn't want&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;them to&#160;find out.&#160;<br />
&#160;5. Has enough kids<br />
&#160;6. Pregnant through an extramarital affair<br />
&#160;7. Not ready to parent no particular reason given<br />
&#160;8. Does not know who the father is casual sex (hooking&#160; up)&#160;with multiple partners<br />
&#160;9. Pressure from someone else to abort (family, boyfriend, employer)<br />
10. Sex is purely recreational I never thought I'd get pregnant!</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Women never tell us, Gee, I wouldn't have an abortion if I could get free health care. They know they can get free health care. <em>It's not about health care it's about the devaluing of human life in our culture, and most of the responsibility lies in the fact that abortions have been legal since 1973</em> [emphasis added]. Please do not be duped into this lie about abortion and health care. The only way to stop it is to make it illegal and teach â€œabstinence-only in our homes, our churches and our schools.<br /><br />
Now I must say that some of the poorest of the poor do not get abortions, because they cannot pay for them (a first-trimester abortion runs about $350 in our city). So, if health care passes that includes free abortions (a.k.a. family planning services), then even these women will succumb to the culture of death.<br /><br />
If you have any independent studies (not by Planned Parenthood) that corroborate your claim, please send them to me, so that I can read them.<br /><br />
If abortion were illegal, then the choice to abort would change to the choice of an adoption and occasionally to parenting. In our current climate, abortion is an easy option for now (or so they think!) because no one will know that I was ever pregnant.<br /><br />
If it were just as simple as giving them free health care, there would be no use for crisis pregnancy centers. I would happily give up my position here if it were all true, but I know better. I encourage you to visit a crisis center in your state and talk one-on-one with the consultants for more in-depth conversation.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">There it is, from an expert. This woman has given us a window into the world of the expectant mother who does not wish to be the mother of a living child. I would hasten to add that most of these mothers do not consider themselves to be the mother of a preborn child, but prefer to think of themselves as a woman with a problem requiring a quick solution. I also believe that this counselor is correct to point out that if abortion is covered in any health care reform plan, abortion numbers will go through the roof. So why hasn't this been made clear?<br /><br />
First and foremost, pro-life America <em>is</em> making the case, and we are not going to shut up. And it is my opinion that, after all these weeks of debate, perhaps the truth is sinking in. Perhaps Americans are finally beginning to think beyond the Obamacare marketing phrases, gobbledygook and false promises making their way through town-hall meetings and other such venues. <br /><br />
On this subject the facts about abortion-minded mothers it is my sincere hope that people across this nation will spread the words of this wise pro-life pregnancy counselor, and help their ministers, priests, bishops and others see that Obamacare is going to increase the killing of the preborn, not ameliorate the situation.<br /><br />
