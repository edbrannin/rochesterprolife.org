Linda died peacefully knowing that she had a choice in controlling her suffering and time of death from pancreatic cancer. â€œI am a very spiritual person, and it was very important to me to be conscious, clear-minded and alert at the time of my death. The powerful pain medications were making it difficult to maintain the state of mind I wanted to have at my death. And I knew I would have to increase them. I am grateful that the Death with Dignity law provides me the choice of a death that fits my own personal beliefs.â€<br /><br />
â€œWhen a cure is no longer possible, the Death With Dignity Act adds another option for patients dying from a terminal illness. The prescribed medication gives patients peace of mind that they can use to take control of their dying if suffering becomes intolerable,â€ said Dr. Tom Preston, MD, a cardiologist and C&amp;Câ€™s medical director, â€œMost dying patients experience suffering. The Death With Dignity Act allows a physician to help his patients maintain as much control and dignity as they can at the end of life. Last night, the Death With Dignity Act provided a way to honor this patientâ€™s final decision.â€</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Note the clever use of language.&#160; Apparently, the public is supposed to buy into the argument that it is better to know you are going to take your own life so that your â€œpeace of mindâ€ is restored.&#160; While I am not sure how that equates with oneâ€™s eternal happiness, it is obvious that the twisted logic of these proponents of death knows no bounds.<br /><br />

Obviously she had not done adequate research or she did the research and did not like what she found. It doesn't play well for euthanasia supporters.â€<br /><br />
Clearly, as Pickup reports, when â€œpain medications are properly administered by medical professionals with current and up-to-date understanding of pain management medications and techniques â€“ complete pain relief can be achieved without the loss of lucidity or confusion to the patient.â€<br /><br />
But of course even if this were not so, the state should never be in the unconscionable position of facilitating direct or indirect killing because it is the antithesis of all Anglo-American historical legal traditions, usually referred to as the common law.&#160; <br /><br />
From a </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=180&amp;L=1293&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">historical </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">perspective, the Anglo-American common law tradition has punished or otherwise disapproved of both suicide and assisting suicide for over 700 years.&#160; Over time, the â€œpunishmentâ€ aspect of the law went away because it became clear that suicidal individuals needed therapeutic treatment for their disorder rather than severe legal punishment.&#160; However, that did not translate into permitting assisted suicide under law until recently.<br /><br />
As a matter of fact, Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, who delivered the Supreme Court opinion in the 1997 </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=180&amp;L=1275&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Washington v.

Swift, in his early 19th century treatise on the laws of Connecticut, stated that "[i]f one counsels another to commit suicide, and the other by reason of the advice kills himself, the advisor is guilty of murder as principal." â€¦ ("`The right to life and to personal security is not only sacred in the estimation of the common law, but it is inalienable'"). And the prohibitions against assisting suicide never contained exceptions for those who were near death. Rather, "[t]he life of those to whom life ha[d] become a burden-of those who [were] hopelessly diseased or fatally wounded-nay, even the lives of criminals condemned to death, [were] under the protection of law, equally as the lives of those who [were] in the full tide of life's enjoyment, and anxious to continue to live."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Things have certainly changed in the intervening twelve years, and not for the better.&#160; Now the United States has two states that have legitimized the act in law.

Back in 1956, large-scale human clinical trials of the birth control pill were begun in order to gain approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Gregory Pincus, a biologist who worked closely with Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood’s founder, chose Puerto Rico as the location for the human trials because it provided a large pool of poor, uneducated women who could be easily monitored. The local doctor in charge of the study told Pincus that the pill caused "too many side reactions to be generally acceptable." However, Pincus and Dr. John Rock, a Catholic ob-gyn who violated Church teachings by advocating contraception, dismissed her findings and did not investigate what caused the side effects, nor did they investigate the causes of the deaths that took place during the trials.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The pill killed women back before the pill was even "approved" in the U.S., and the pill continues to kill today.&#160; Why aren’t we hearing more about this?&#160; Could it be because of the millions of dollars invested in contraception?

When foreign petroleum is relatively inexpensive and world petroleum prices are low because of vast inexpensive foreign reserves, there is little incentive to develop slightly more expensive U.S. petroleum, as it would not be able to compete.&#160; However, there is still plenty of U.S. petroleum, if the need to drill in the U.S. arises.&#160; The many coastal areas known to contain petroleum, as well as the giant extension adjacent to the Prudhoe Bay petroleum field in Alaska, are simply off limits to drilling by current law.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Technological advances are slashing the costs of finding, producing and refining oil, creating a new economic calculus for the oil industry.&#160; The new alchemy runs from three-dimensional seismology to exotic wells that sit on the ocean floor, in some cases eliminating the need for billion-dollar offshore production platforms.&#160; Technology always drives down cost and always overwhelms depletion!&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">When one looks at a petroleum industry map of oil fields, it appears that less than 10 percent of the earth’s land surface has been well explored for oil fields.&#160; According to the most popular theory, oil has been formed from the remains of tiny marine plants and animals.&#160; If so, substantially all the petroleum should be in the ocean which is largely unexplored.&#160; Based on historical tables, U.S. Government predictions since 1866 of future oil production and reserves have always been inaccurate.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Next month:&#160; Other natural resources</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3"><u><em>Last Day Today - Open public comment period on NIH embryonic stem cell research draft guidelines<br /></em></u>The NIH officially posted draft guidelines on ESC, which open the floodgates for the destruction of embryos at taxpayers' expense.

Dr. Wortmanâ€™s professional background shocked me into wondering how he could possibly be involved on one level with a project designed to remind America of the horror of the German Holocaust, while at the same time participating in the American holocaust, which has, by far, robbed many more innocent people of their lives.<br /><br />

First of all, the presentation was part of a series of talks that has been spearheaded by Morris Wortman, one of Rochesterâ€™s most prominent abortionists. Wortman is not exactly shy and retiring when it comes to his advocacy for abortion. He has come out publicly a number of times in support of taking the lives of the unborn.

Many pro-life activists have characterized the taking of innocent life in the womb as the â€œabortion holocaust.â€ How unfortunate that these two deacons fail to see the irony of their collaboration with Dr. Wortman on this project.</strong></font></p><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>Sadly, I agree with every word that Mr. Michael has written, but I also feel strongly that if Deacon Sciolino truly wants to understand the tragedy of the first Holocaust, he should become familiar with the full body of facts required to support a credible presentation. As a Catholic, it is hard for me to see how Sciolino could blame Christianity for anything at all when millions of Christians were murdered during the Nazi atrocities as well.<br /><br />
At the same time, it is in the paradox of the collaboration between the abortionist and the Catholic deacons that the answer to this unexplainable association occurs. Their joint project is designed to raise awareness about the ugliness of murdering innocent people while avoiding the obvious contradiction that is occurring in their midst. <br /><br />
Sciolino, by deferring attention away from Wortmanâ€™s everyday practice and focusing in on the disconnect between Christian belief and Christian behavior, probably feels comfortable working side by side with a man who perpetrates the very same crimes against innocents that he is exposing in a partnership focused on the German Holocaust. Perhaps this same therapy of denial provides a healing salve to the conscience of the abortionist who can look the other way when confronted with the reality of what he does every day as he begs America to learn from the lessons of history and remember those who died more than 50 years ago.<br /><br />
Obviously, there are deep-seated reasons why some do not want to compare the Holocaust of yesterday with the Holocaust of today.<br /><br />

The case being handled by the Alliance Defense Fund was brought on behalf of nurse Toni Lemly who had worked in the St. Tammany Parish Hospital, but sued when she objected to dispensing the "morning after" abortion pill because of her religious beliefs and was demoted. The hospital's lawyers sought to have her case dismissed out of hand, and when that attempt failed, went to the state Supreme Court to try to obtain that ruling.

But something else occurred at the </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1163&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">UW Hospital</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> that has gone practically unnoticed by the wider community, and it is as troubling and depraved as the idea of approving late term abortions.&#160; According to recent reports,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">an advocacy group is alleging that doctors at UW Hospital broke the law by withholding treatment from two developmentally disabled patients with apparent cases of pneumonia.<br /><br />
The guardian of one patient, who survived, at first went along with and then later disagreed with the decision to withhold care, the lawsuit by Disability Rights Wisconsin alleges. The parents of the other patient, who died, pushed for the withdrawal of treatment, according to the groupâ€™s complaint filed Thursday in Dane County Circuit Court.<br /><br />
But a spokeswoman for UW Hospital said the hospital acted in the best interests of both patients and tried to follow the wishes of their familiesâ€¦.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The â€œtreatmentâ€ being discussed in these cases, by the way, is food and water!&#160; In other words, the patient was not dying from a condition, but would, and in one case did, die of starvation.&#160; What sort of medical care is that?<br /><br />
As the disability rights group </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1164&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Not Dead Yet</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> has pointed out, with this case and another in Pennsylvania of the same type, one has to wonder just how many such cases occur in hospitals around the nation but never come to the attention of advocates who might be able to help the helpless patient survive!&#160;&#160; <br /><br />
So what is going on at the University of Wisconsin-Madison?&#160; Is this a coincidence and nothing more than a fluke that the same university appears dedicated to the principle that vulnerable human beings, whether born or preborn, are frequently better off dead?&#160; <br /><br />
Clearly, the mentality that fosters a culture of death has taken hold at the university and, just like cancer, has spread from the expectant mothers in their care to the needy patients in their care who are helpless, and in some cases, have no one to defend their human dignity and their human rights.<br /><br />
The common denominator that links the disability rights case to the late term abortion facility is obvious.&#160; Disregard for the human person takes on all sorts of identities and excuses depending on who is setting the policies.&#160; If it is acceptable to kill the preborn, why not the already born who are in need of special care?&#160; As one </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1163&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">medical ethicist</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> put it, â€œHow much power do families and guardians have to make medical decisions for vulnerable patients such as children and the developmentally disabled?â€ <br /><br />
The answer is that if the vulnerable individual is a resident of his motherâ€™s womb, then that mother has total power to choose life or death for the child according to the law.&#160; And very soon the law that sanctions death at the beginning of life could well sanction it at any point during anotherâ€™s life, depending on whether or not the patient can speak up and defend himself.&#160; Such acts of course, will not, be defined as murder, but rather simply as exercises of a right to choose what is best for everyone involved.<br /><br />

This reality is characterized by the emergence of a culture which denies solidarity and in many cases takes the form of a veritable "culture of death". This culture is actively fostered by powerful cultural, economic and political currents which encourage an idea of society excessively concerned with efficiency. Looking at the situation from this point of view, it is possible to speak in a certain sense of a war of the powerful against the weak: a life which would require greater acceptance, love and care is considered useless, or held to be an intolerable burden, and is therefore rejected in one way or another. A person who, because of illness, handicap or, more simply, just by existing, compromises the well-being or life-style of those who are more favored tends to be looked upon as an enemy to be resisted or eliminated.

"Not only is the University of Notre Dame no longer Catholic, but a recent survey conducted by one of the nation’s most respected polling organizations shows that the school now recognizes as legitimate the pro-abortion position, which places it at odds with the majority of Americans.<br /><br />

While Notre Dame graduates sat listening to the president expound his ideology of relativism and absence of truth, Catholics outside Notre Dame upheld the timeless truths of a faith that the leadership of Our Lady’s University no longer upholds.<br /><br />
Catholics outside Notre Dame stood for the human rights and personhood of all human beings from their biological beginning.<br /><br />
Catholics outside Notre Dame upheld the root of Catholic social teaching: the sanctity of human life.<br /><br />
Catholics outside Notre Dame were a witness to the truth that Notre Dame is no longer Catholic.<br /><br />

This is usually because there are no facts to support their position, having said that, we know that we can always expect rants from such people. There have been a couple of doozies this week.<br /><br />
Both of those bellowing are female, both have a long record of pro-abortion fanaticism, but both, in my humble opinion have gone off the deep end. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1069&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Missouri State Senator Joan Bray</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, for example, took off after pro-life male politicians in a manner that I have not heard about in a very long time. <br /><br />
The debate that occurred in the state senate focused on a piece of legislation that was originally supposed to protect the expectant mother seeking an abortion from coercion by the abortion provider. The current bill is so weak that pro-life activist/lobbyist Sam Lee has asked legislators not to vote for it. But that has not deterred </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1068&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Senator Bray</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. Bray was incensed by the very idea that such a law would even be proposed. During the debate, Senator Bray said, "A vote for this bill is a vote for the state to lie to these women in print. I'm sick of women being treated like they're so stupid that they can't be responsible for their own reproductive decisions."<br /><br />
Note that Bray did not expound on the reasons why expectant mothers do not need to know the dangers of aborting a child, but rather focused her comments on gibberish. We've heard all this before; it only occurs when pro-abortion zealots cannot defend their position. <br /><br />
Let's see what else Bray had to say: "I'm sick of women having no options, and being coerced to give birth."<br /><br />
Coercing a mother to give birth to her own child is a ridiculous premise. If the woman in question does not wish to bear a child, then she can take steps to avoid the situation that brings about pregnancy. Bray is the one insulting women, at least in this case:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">"I'm sick of a bunch of men around here, year after year after year, piling up restriction after restriction after restriction on women who found themselves in a very unhappy, unpleasant circumstance of an unwanted pregnancy."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">How did these expectant mothers find themselves in this circumstance? I think we know exactly how it happened, and again, we know that people of both sexes know how to avoid it. The preborn child is not the cause of unhappiness, unpleasantness or unwantedness; he or she did not have a say in the matter. However the female and the male did, Senator Bray. Think about it. <br /><br />
Senator Bray again: "I am sick of the disrespect for women who come to the Capitol defending a woman's legal right to choose an abortion."<br /><br />
Aha! You see, we finally got to her point. Bray is not going to advocate abstinence until marriage, fidelity within marriage or any of the qualities that predispose self-respect and respect for the other person. No, Bray just wants unrestricted access to abortion on demand. <br /><br />
Yes, Senator Bray is sick, but not because of the defense of preborn children that she is hearing and not because of the sincere concerns some lawmakers have about expectant mothers whose health and well-being will be at risk if they decide to abort their children. In fact, it seems to me that Senator Bray is sick to death of the growing number of pro-life advocates in the state legislature and has chosen to lash out at them in a manner similar to a cat fight â€¦ though there is but one of the usual two feline contenders in this fight.<br /><br />
The idea of tying "responsibility" to the notion of solving a problem by killing a person has been around since the struggle between pro-life and pro-death forces began. But now that the pro-life movement is making appreciable gains in public sentiment and political commitment, things are looking bad for the Brays of the world. I think the poor lady needs a vacation.<br /><br />
Using a single speech to attack her peers, suggesting that they are disrespectful toward members of the opposite sex smacks of disingenuousness. <br /><br />
Perhaps Senator Bray's bigotry against pro-life men comes about because she is too committed to rhetorical zealotry and has lost her ability to be civil. I don't know, but it certainly appears that way.<br /><br />

they are urged, after careful examination of the situation with a particular pro-abortion public figure, to take proper action to deny Holy Communion to such people. </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1081&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Church law does not exist to be ignored</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">; it exists to be enforced and there are no exceptions.<br /><br />
Frances Kissling, like Senator Bray, is up in arms. She is all about name-calling, denigrating those with whom she disagrees and lobbing verbal cannon balls toward those of us who truly understand the difference between good and evil.&#160; Truth makes Frances uncomfortable in the same way it makes Senator Bray uncomfortable. <br /><br />
The truth about which I write does not belong to me; it belongs to no human being but is, rather, that truth that is </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1074&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">written on the heart</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> of every human being by God Himself. <br /><br />
This is the fundamental difference between these two ladies and those of us who are committed to that truth. Frances cannot articulate a strong, viable defense of Harry Knox in view of the documentation that was provided to President Obama. And so, like Bray, she resorts to vilifying the messengers so that she can ignore the message. <br /><br />
Disrespect, bias and twisted zealotry grow in a garden sown with seeds of deceit. Such language maligns, but never counters, intellectual honesty. The Kisslings and Brays of our world are sad figures, not only because they have resorted to tactics like those noted here, but because they are human beings who are loved by God and who have somehow lost their way. Let us pray for them and for those who accept what they say without questioning it.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Judie Brown is president of American Life League and a member of the Pontifical Academy for Life.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1082&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Respond to Judie<br /></font></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1082&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.all.org/newsroom_judieblog_response.php?id=2607</font></strong></a></p><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong>Volume 6, Number 19</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong> Monday May 11, 2009</strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">ASSOCIATES FROM THE AMERICAN LIFE LEAGUE</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Please join me in welcoming the newest addition to our Associate network – We the People for Life – currently directed by Karen Reynoso and located in Norco, California!&#160; We the People for Life was formed in February when a number of concerned pro-lifers who had gathered to participate in a very successful 40 Days for Life Campaign felt called to continue their work.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">During the 40 Days for Life campaign, almost 450 people from 50 different churches participated, seventeen women changed their minds and did not abort their children and one security guard quit working at the Planned Parenthood clinic.&#160; Several of the campaign participants were also able to facilitate post-abortion recovery.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">We the People for Life now plans to provide pro-life education and distribute pro-life materials throughout the community, provide a regular ongoing prayer presence at the clinic and provide sidewalk counseling training.&#160; We are very excited to have them in the Associate Program and we look forward to working with them in their future endeavors!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">National Pro-life T-shirt Week<br />

Often times the pill can cause a woman to develop deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in a vein. The blood clot can block the blood supply to the heart or brain, which could result in heart attack, stroke or death. The clot can also travel to the lungs, which could then result in pulmonary embolism or death. Women have died as a direct result of taking the pill.

Such communications, when properly composed, often have a surprisingly strong positive impact.&#160; On the other hand, poorly thought out, angry e-mails, letters and calls can, and do, have significant negative impact - much more than most realize.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><em><strong><font size="3">Do's and Don'ts for E-mails, Letters and Calls</font></strong></em></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts, calmly presented, can have the greatest impact in convincing persons in influential positions to change their views or actions. That is, above all, emphasize facts, not emotions.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Respectful communication opens up the door to consideration of your points. If you really do want to convince your listener of your views, or to have them at least think about them, you must communicate as you would want them to communicate with you - with respect - no matter how serious your disagreement might be. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Being respectful does not require softening or compromising your principles. It also does not require abandoning boldness or advocating a right course of action. Be insistent, be bold, if the circumstances call for this, but never demean, attack or demand. If you have recently done so, send a letter or e-mail of genuine apology. That will give you, and especially your views, renewed credibility with the recipient of your previous harsh communications.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Do not assume that the person you are communicating with fully understands or knows the facts about the matter concerned. Very often he or she is relying upon well known and trusted advisors who have presented a convincing alternative case. As well, your recipient’s personal experiences may consistently contradict what you are revealing and so it may genuinely be difficult for them to accept your assertions at first. It is often a serious mistake to send an e-mail or letter assuming that the person is acting in bad faith and/or knows what you know.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">5.&#160;&#160;&#160; Do not use capitalized words, phrases or sentences, colored text and exclamation marks in your communications. It conveys shouting, which it is presumed, is exactly what you want to communicate. It is a very ineffective way to attempt to convince someone to do what they should. In fact, it is far more likely to close minds, entrench a negative view of all persons who hold the position you are trying to convey and end up in the trash without having been read.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">6.&#160;&#160;&#160; Never respond in kind to harsh responses from those you communicate with. You do not know the circumstances that might have led to that kind of response. Patience, humility, time and continued respectful communication may yet produce a positive result.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">7.&#160;&#160;&#160; Try to place yourself in the shoes of the person you are communicating with as you compose your e-mail or letter. Most of the public has no comprehension of the heavy influences, difficulties and stresses experienced by elected public officials, religious leaders and others in leadership positions. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><em><strong><font size="3">Writing to bshops, cardinals and other clergy</font></strong></em></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">8.&#160;&#160;&#160; All of the above points apply.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">9.&#160;&#160; Do not tell a bishop what to do.

A bishop is a normal human being and usually likes to be talked to as such.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">11.&#160;&#160;&#160; With Church authorities, it is always crucial to communicate respectfully, charitably and in as few paragraphs as possible. That is the kind of communication that is the most likely to produce a positive response from these individuals who live in a culture that strongly requires such communications. Bishops are usually overwhelmed with correspondence and their daily duties. They have little time to read detailed, lengthy e-mails and letters. When more detail is required they will let you know.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">12.&#160;&#160;&#160; Where there is clearly a serious problem regarding a bishop's behavior or decision making and the bishop has become intransigent, it is best to communicate your factual concerns to relevant Vatican authorities.

Personally, I had the most remarkable mother that any human being could ever hope to have. My mom, Bertha, was a solidly faithful, courageous and loving woman who gave her all to her daughters and to her son. My brother was with us for such a brief period of time, but each day was so special for all of us. There is not a day that goes by that I do not reflect on how my mother cared for that special little boy, my brother Mark, who's Down syndrome weakened his small body and made it impossible for him to fight off a common cold. Even during his illness and death, my mother was a beacon of love in the midst of her sorrow and her pain. <br /><br />
I have fond memories of my mom, memories that have constantly reminded me that there is no better role model for me than her. So on this coming Mother's Day I will not only appreciate my own children in a special way, but once again my mom.<br /><br />
It is a sad commentary on our times that so many young mothers will never have the opportunity to be embraced by their children, or learn valuable lessons from their children, or appreciate the wonder of a child who grows up to become a fine, upstanding member of the human race. Such mothers will miss so much in their lives because they chose to end their child's life before birth rather than welcome and affirm the gift of that child.<br /><br />
While the acceptance and advocacy of abortion is, if nothing else, a testimony to our current cultural attitudes toward parenthood and the rejection of the blessing of giving of one's self for the benefit of another, there are movements afoot to change all that. More expectant mothers today are carrying their babies to term than ever before. Fewer of them are exercising their choice to </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=139&amp;L=975&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">kill</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. <br /><br />
But that does not mean that the abortion industry is asleep at the wheel. Far from it, as Planned Parenthood made perfectly clear in its most recent e-mail blast asking for money. The hook was </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=139&amp;L=974&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Judy Blume</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, an active supporter of PP and author of numerous children's books. Blume wrote, "</font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=139&amp;L=979&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">There is no organization that I know of that supports motherhood and all that it means more than PP</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">." <br /><br />
What a perfect example of society's disdain for what it really means to be a mother.<br /><br />

But this is nothing to laugh about. PP has murdered over 4,000,000 babies in the United States. PP has no clue as to what motherhood is all about.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Indeed! As is always the case, harbingers of gloom, doom and destruction never saw a special day they could not corrupt with their messages of death. Having said that, I have to admit it is my firm conviction that such organizations are on the way to defeat. They know it and thus find it necessary to use every opportunity they can to entice the uninformed into believing that there is something good and self-satisfying about killing your own child before he is born. As tragic as this is, we know that evil will not triumph at the end of the day. In the meantime, it is taking its toll and we need to not only be mindful of it, but prayerful about it. <br /><br />

We thank You for our mothers to whom You have entrusted the care of every precious human life from its very beginning in the womb.<br /><br />
You have given to woman the capacity of participating with You in the creation of new life. Grant that every woman may come to understand the full meaning of that blessing, which gives her an unlimited capacity for selfless love for every child she may be privileged to bear, and for all Your children.<br /><br />
Watch over every mother who is with child, strengthen her faith in Your fatherly care and love for her and for her unborn baby. Give her courage in times of fear or pain, understanding in times of uncertainty and doubt, and hope in times of trouble. Grant her joy in the birth of her child.<br /><br />
To mothers You have given the great privilege and responsibility of being a child's first teacher and spiritual guide. Grant that all mothers may worthily foster the faith of their children, following the example of Mary, Elizabeth, and other holy women who follow Christ. Help mothers to grow daily in knowledge and understanding of Your Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, and grant them the wisdom to impart this knowledge faithfully to their children, and to all who depend upon them.<br /><br />
Assist all "spiritual mothers", those who, though they may have no children of their own, nevertheless selflessly care for the children of others â€“ of every age and state in life. Grant that they may know the joy of fulfilling this motherly calling of women, whether in teaching, nursing, religious life, or in other work which recognizes and fosters the true dignity of every human being created in Your image and likeness.<br /><br />
We beseech You to send Your Holy Spirit, the Comforter, to all mothers who sorrow for children that have died, are ill or estranged from their families, or who are in trouble or danger of any kind.

American Life League's young leaders have experienced some of this firsthand in South Bend, but it has not deterred them. Many others, like us, who are also focused on this problem, have heard and seen more than could ever have been imagined, and not much of it is positive.<br /><br />
My favorite is the e-mail I received from a gentleman who said,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">What do you suggest Catholics do, bury their heads in the sand, and only talk and listen to those who agree with us? Shall we build an invisible wall around us, similar to what China really did? This is what you seem to be advocating in light of the Obama Notre Dame thing. Remember Cardinal Egan ate at table with Obama at the Al Smith Dinner.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In responding to him, I explained that we Catholics are not ostriches; but we are people who believe that there is a time and a place to expose the horror of an abortion-supporting politician's views. Having said that, we do not think a graduation ceremony at an identifiably Catholic institution is the place for this to occur. Notre Dame could have invited the president to debate his views with a pro-life politician, or they could have hosted a town-hall lecture during which those students who know that abortion is an act of murder could have voiced their position and perhaps helped the president understand the error of his ways. But graduation? <br /><br />
While I am not sure what the Great Wall of China has to do with this, I certainly do recall the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner at which Cardinal Egan was photographed while apparently mesmerized by Obama. It is not my favorite photo of a prince of the Church; that's for sure.

But he didn't give them a platform to preach to the faithful. That's the difference here."<br /><br />
Indeed, that is the difference and the specific reason why ALL is working with the Cardinal Newman Society and other like-minded organizations to expose this and press for even a last-minute cancellation of the invitation. But if that fails, then as our </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=842&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">petition to Bishop D'Arcy of Ft. Wayne-South Bend, Indiana</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, points out,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Any Catholic school that dissents from Catholic teaching to the degree that it would honor a man guilty of promoting an intrinsic evil of the magnitude of abortion has given up its Catholic identity and does not deserve to be listed in <em>The Official Catholic Directory</em>. <br /><br />
Notre Dame should be removed from the list of Catholic institutions, not only because its actions are discordant with the Catholic faith, but because it is scandalizing the very minds it is supposed to be molding and offering them â€“ instead of Catholic truth â€“ relativism, liberalism and a consistent pattern of behavior incompatible with Catholic teaching.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=923&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">ALL</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> is sponsoring an event this evening in South Bend at which we will focus on â€œthe sins of Notre Dame." As ALL's leadership director, Michael Barnett, explains, â€œNotre Dame is placing the souls of millions in jeopardy in exchange for their own prestige. The school has no right to sell itself as Catholic to donors and potential students while simultaneously working to undermine the Church and honor the most pro-abortion president in the nation's history.â€<br /><br />

These decisions have sent a shamefully ambiguous message concerning Notre Dame's fidelity to the Church's teaching on the sacredness of human life and the dignity of the human person. As an example of this, one does not need to look further than Notre Dame's decision last year to ignore Bishop D'Arcy's call to cancel the lewd "V-Monologues" with its mockery of Catholic teaching on human sexuality. <br /><br />
It is my intent not to support Catholic formation programs offered at Notre Dame until its leadership discontinues making decisions that are inconsistent with the promotion of the Catholic Church's teachings on the sacredness of human life.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">We are so very grateful for these profound words and for the outpouring of similar sentiments from nearly 60 princes of the Catholic Church. <br /><br />
Sadly, however, the Notre Dame scandal, while the most egregious I have seen at a supposedly Catholic institution, is not unique. As a matter of fact, the Obama invitation is simply the most horrific example of the decaying respect for Catholic truth that appears to have infected more than a few Catholic campuses. As we go to press today, for example, we learn that the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit institution, is hosting </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=927&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">South African Bishop Kevin Dowling</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, who has, according to a Cardinal Newman Society press release, "publicly criticized abstinence-only programs and supports condom use by those infected with or at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS."<br /><br />
Defiance has reared its ugly head in the Diocese of Scranton as well. Several months ago, </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=928&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Bishop Joseph Martino</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> reprimanded U.S. Senator Robert Casey, a pro-abortion Catholic Democrat, for his position on abortion. In what is clearly an affront to Bishop Martino's directive, the Catholic college, King's College invited </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=929&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Senator Casey</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> to deliver the commencement address to its graduates. <br /><br />
Responding to this, the ever-courageous Bishop Martino said,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">I do not believe he [Casey] has the moral stature to stand before the graduates of a Catholic college to address them about their futures and the challenges they will face when on the most important issue of the dayâ€”the sanctity of human life â€” he cannot muster the courage to oppose the pro-abortion agenda which is currently being promoted in Washington.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">While some so-called Catholics stand up and shout that efforts to get Obama disinvited or have the University of Notre Dame removed from <em>The Official Catholic Directory</em> are tantamount to crawling into a bunker and hiding from the real world, thousands of believing Catholics are calling for an end to the madness. We're not buried in the mind warp of dissent and dislike for all things Catholic; we are simply sick and tired of business as usual. Rather than being ensconced in political correctness, those of us who decry the Notre Dame scandal and similar debacles do so because we love Christ; we love the Church, and we are ready to surrender our very lives in defense of the Church. <br /><br />
We recognize that the unfaithful current leaders of institutions such as the University of Notre Dame and the University of San Francisco actually represent wolves in sheep's clothing, prowling the highways and byways seeking out souls that can be misguided and misled, all in the name of academic freedom. In this conflict between Catholic truth and the "</font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=934&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">father of lies</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">,"many of us are calling for an end to the madness.

The mainstream media may not get it, and perhaps they never will. But that is truly irrelevant at this time of crisis in the Church. As long as Catholic bishops, national organizations like the Cardinal Newman Society, American Life League and media sources with integrity such as Life Site News are shining a light in the darkness, we need not fear, tremble or become discouraged. No bunkers for us! </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=931&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Pope Benedict XVI</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> reminded us several years ago,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Life is not only given at the moment of death and not only in the manner of martyrdom.

Day by day I must learn to abandon myself; to keep myself available for whatever he, the Lord, needs of me at a given moment, even if other things seem more appealing and more important to me: it means giving life, not taking it. <br /><br />
It is in this very way that we experience freedom: freedom from ourselves, the vastness of being. In this very way, by being useful, in being a person whom the world needs, our life becomes important and beautiful.

Here are a few such arguments, followed by our response to each:<br /><br />
So-called personhood amendments do not seek to give more information to women or counsel them to seek alternatives to abortion. Instead, such bills challenge the U.S. Supreme Court â€˜s 1973 <em>Roe v. Wade</em> ruling.<br /><br />
This argument is not really an argument but an explanation of what opponents see as the major defect in proposed human personhood amendments. But it is erroneous. The effort to pursue human personhood challenges both of the 1973 Supreme Court decisions at their core, not the periphery. We are certain that if the Supreme Court took </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=129&amp;L=892&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Blackmun's</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> argument seriously, <em>Roe</em>, <em>Doe </em>and their progeny would fall. Therefore, giving more information to women or counseling them to seek alternatives to abortion is a need that is separate from defending human personhood. In fact, once human personhood is recognized in the law, abortion itself would be defined as a crime against human rights, civil rights and equal rights. It would, in fact, be recognized as the act of murder that it is.<br /><br />
A second argument against pursuing human personhood goes like this:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">As it stands, there is still a majority on the Court that would uphold decriminalized abortion. Not only would an unfavorable decision strengthen abortion-â€œrightsâ€ case law, but it also invites the Court to define when life begins, which they have not done to date.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">This argument is based on a total lack of understanding of the impact the Supreme Courtâ€™s post-1973 abortion decisions have had. After all, each such decision has recognized the legitimacy of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and <em>Doe v. Bolton</em> by recognizing the legal status of abortion. As the five Catholic Supreme Court justices said in the </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=129&amp;L=893&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Gonzales v. Carhart</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3">&#160; decision,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn. The Act's ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government's objectives. No one would dispute that, for many, D&amp;E is a procedure itself laden with the power to devalue human life. Congress could nonetheless conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obviously, the Supreme Court is strengthening abortion â€œrightsâ€ every time any case involving abortion comes its way! As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the legitimacy of abortion as long as the "undue burden" does not affect a mother's â€œrightâ€ to kill her preborn child. So, arguing that personhood proposals would somehow set the pro-life movement back is ridiculous!<br /><br />
Furthermore, the Supreme Court has not been asked to address the scientific evidence regarding when a human being begins since 1971, when it heard the oral arguments preceding its 1973 decisions. At that time, the Court simply refused to hear the facts. <br />
&#160;<br />
Here is a third argument against personhood proposals:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Ultimately, it will be public sentiment that will bring an end to abortion in the United States and not forced, untimely or imprudent legislation. The incrementalist strategy is sound, prudent and effective, and â€¦ it gives far more than it takes.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">To argue that focusing on the central fact that aborting a preborn child is wrong because that child is a human person is not forced, untimely or imprudent. It is accurate, hopeful and necessary. Arguments that suggest otherwise expose the sordid truth that at least a few pro-life leaders are repeatedly leading pro-life Americans to agree that abortion for rape, incest and the life of the mother is acceptable. Such an incrementalist position provides the Courts with additional reasons to affirm <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. <br /><br />
Those who oppose personhood proposals are lost in a rhetorical fog, and to that we say, please let us help you find your way!<br /><br />
The fourth argument comes from a Catholic priest who opposes the human personhood effort:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">The question we must ask ourselves is this: What is greater â€“ my uncompromised moral position or the innocent lives of the unborn?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">This is perhaps one of the most tired, self-serving statements I have seen. Oddly enough, it always comes from those who refuse to address the factual evidence regarding the personhood of the preborn child. If we as pro-life Americans are honest, and I think most of us are, we would take the time to examine what has contributed to the perpetuation of what the Supreme Court refers to as protecting abortion when an "undue burden" is imposed on expectant mothers. Clearly, the Court, like most culture-of -death proponents, finds it more "realistic" to continue the status quo than to bite the bullet and join with those of us who have changed course and do recognize that the past 36 years have delivered defeat after defeat for preborn human persons.<br /><br />
The "uncompromised moral position" is that our pro-life identity obligates us to do all we can to focus on the human person whose existence is acknowledged by so few, to recognize his individuality and humanize him for one and all. Regulating the murder of these preborn persons by employing flawed incrementalist propositions will not accomplish this goal. Such proposals actually contradict personhood and are designed to appease politicians, not save the preborn. How can a single one of us be satisfied with regulating what is, at its core, an act of murder? <br /><br />
So, while some will continue to argue against the pursuit of human personhood for any number of trumped-up reasons, the human personhood movement will be guided by the lessons it has learned from the failures of those who have surrendered to the Supreme Courtâ€™s version of what human beings should and should not be, based on a totally false "undue burden" argument.<br /><br />
May those who seek to undermine the human personhood movement recognize the facts and acknowledge the failures of the past. May they finally understand that merely regulating such a heinous crime has resulted in death and perpetuated the "undue burden" myth. May they examine their opposition and see what we see â€¦ a positive, proactive affirmation of human beings whose civil rights, human rights and equal rights are being violated at least 3,000 times a day, 365 days a year, by acts of murder â€¦ acts of abortion.<br /><br />

On June 6, 2009, men, women and men across the country will take a stand against the birth control pill at pharmacies, drug stores, Planned Parenthoods and other so-called family planning businesses nationwide.<br /><br />
“Research shows women using oral contraceptives have five times greater risk of death from cardiovascular causes,” said Marie Hahnenberg, a researcher for American Life League.<br /><br />
In 2004 alone, </strong></font><a href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=84904&amp;N=148&amp;L=1029&amp;F=H"><font size="3"><strong>21,813 females died in the United States from cardiac arrest and heart failure</strong></font></a><font size="3"><strong>, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. <br /><br />
&#160;“How many of these 21,813 women were on the pill, or at one point in their lives had been on the pill?”<br /><br />
“The federal government has a moral obligation to conduct research on this question and to modify the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death so that the right questions are asked,” Hahnenberg continued. ““We have reports of women who have died from the birth control pill and other birth control products and others are suffering terrible side effects which could lead to death. Women need to be informed about the truth behind this dangerous drug.” <br /><br />
Protest the Pill Day is the largest protest ever against the birth control pill and other birth control products. Last year, participants across the United States shared the facts on exactly how the pill kills babies. This year, the event will expose the sordid details surrounding the tragic effects these chemicals have on women.<br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942. <br />

Excerpts from <em>The Winning Side</em> by Charles E. Rice</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Is it possible to be unconditionally pro-life in the United States today?&#160; Since <span style="font-style: italic">Roe v. Wade</span>, in 1973, legalized abortion has delivered a body count of a least 49 million, not including deaths from uncountable abortions by hormonal contraception.&#160; And we have legalized euthanasia, notwithstanding the false optimism generated by the Supreme Court’s refusal to discover a “right to die” in the Constitution. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The immediate pro-life response to <span style="font-style: italic">Roe </span>was, properly, to undo that ruling by constitutional amendment or legislation.&#160; Those efforts have failed.&#160; And, in seeking incremental restrictions on abortion rather than its prohibition, the establishment pro-life movement has implicitly accepted the basic premise of <span style="font-style: italic">Roe</span>, that the unborn child is a nonperson whose execution can be legitimately tolerated by the state.&#160; In any event, technology is moving abortion and euthanasia beyond the effective reach of the law.&#160; They are truly becoming matters of private choice. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Legalized abortion and euthanasia, however, are symptoms.&#160; In a culture dominated by a relativist and utilitarian contraceptive ethic, it is predictable that man will make himself (or herself) the arbiter of the ending as well as the beginning of life.&#160; A national moral meltdown has accelerated the dominance of the culture of death.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Choosing to be unconditionally pro-life is difficult because of these cultural and constitutional developments.&#160; But the choice is inescapable.&#160; There appears to be an increasing return to a radical choice for humanity, not unlike the one represented in the first centuries of the Christian era.&#160; We can, even today, be unconditionally pro-life through the gift of self, in faith, to God and to others.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Mis-education has caused many to be unable or unwilling to distinguish objective wrong from subjective culpability.&#160; Many seem to think that nothing is wrong “for you” unless you “feel” it is wrong.&#160; But the intentional killing of an innocent human being is always objectively wrong.&#160; It is contrary to natural justice, the revealed law of God and the common good of society, regardless of the motive or other subjective dispositions of the killer.&#160; We do no favor to the person contemplating abortion when we encourage her to decide according to her feelings.&#160; It is a lie to pretend that abortion can ever be anything but an objective evil.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The natural law dictates that human law can never legitimately tolerate the intentional killing of innocent human beings.&#160; This principle, which allows no exception, also implies the law’s duty to protect all innocent life.&#160; If human laws are just, they bind in conscience.&#160; But if a human law “deflects from the law of nature,” it is unjust “and is no longer a law but a perversion of law.”&#160; Laws authorizing the intentional killing of the innocent are unjust because they withdraw from the potential victim the even-handed protection of the law to which he is entitled.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Confusion can also arise from a failure to distinguish the objective merits of pro-life legislative proposals from the motives of those who advocate them.&#160; Prominent leaders in the pro-life movement have spent at least two decades validating the pro-death premise that the law may legitimately allow the intentional killing of innocent human beings.&#160; They began by conceding the legality of abortion to save the life of the mother.&#160; They have ended by proposing only marginal restrictions on otherwise unlimited abortion.&#160; When the “pro-life” movement itself concedes that the intentional killing of the innocent is politically negotiable, how can we be surprised at the impotence of that movement in confronting euthanasia?&#160; The futility of the establishment pro-life movement arises basically from its refusal to condemn the objective wrong of contraception.&#160; In contraception man makes himself, rather than God, the arbiter of life’s beginning.&#160; Why is anyone surprised when he makes himself the arbiter also of its end?&#160; The elimination of the unwanted at both ends of life will be a predictable response to the problems caused by an excess of old people and a shortage of workers to support them, a shortage directly resulting from contraception and abortion.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The pro-life movement lost the war [when] it chose to fight on the enemy’s terms.&#160; Early abortifacient technology, however, signals a new war in which abortion and euthanasia will be a truly private choice.&#160; This war can be won only through a reconversion of the American people to respect for life as a gift of God.&#160; The pro-life movement can contribute to that reconversion only if it bears witness to the truth without compromise of principle.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial;

Linda died peacefully knowing that she had a choice in controlling her suffering and time of death from pancreatic cancer. â€œI am a very spiritual person, and it was very important to me to be conscious, clear-minded and alert at the time of my death. The powerful pain medications were making it difficult to maintain the state of mind I wanted to have at my death. And I knew I would have to increase them. I am grateful that the Death with Dignity law provides me the choice of a death that fits my own personal beliefs.â€<br /><br />
â€œWhen a cure is no longer possible, the Death With Dignity Act adds another option for patients dying from a terminal illness. The prescribed medication gives patients peace of mind that they can use to take control of their dying if suffering becomes intolerable,â€ said Dr. Tom Preston, MD, a cardiologist and C&amp;Câ€™s medical director, â€œMost dying patients experience suffering. The Death With Dignity Act allows a physician to help his patients maintain as much control and dignity as they can at the end of life. Last night, the Death With Dignity Act provided a way to honor this patientâ€™s final decision.â€</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Note the clever use of language.&#160; Apparently, the public is supposed to buy into the argument that it is better to know you are going to take your own life so that your â€œpeace of mindâ€ is restored.&#160; While I am not sure how that equates with oneâ€™s eternal happiness, it is obvious that the twisted logic of these proponents of death knows no bounds.<br /><br />

Obviously she had not done adequate research or she did the research and did not like what she found. It doesn't play well for euthanasia supporters.â€<br /><br />
Clearly, as Pickup reports, when â€œpain medications are properly administered by medical professionals with current and up-to-date understanding of pain management medications and techniques â€“ complete pain relief can be achieved without the loss of lucidity or confusion to the patient.â€<br /><br />
But of course even if this were not so, the state should never be in the unconscionable position of facilitating direct or indirect killing because it is the antithesis of all Anglo-American historical legal traditions, usually referred to as the common law.&#160; <br /><br />
From a </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=180&amp;L=1293&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">historical </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">perspective, the Anglo-American common law tradition has punished or otherwise disapproved of both suicide and assisting suicide for over 700 years.&#160; Over time, the â€œpunishmentâ€ aspect of the law went away because it became clear that suicidal individuals needed therapeutic treatment for their disorder rather than severe legal punishment.&#160; However, that did not translate into permitting assisted suicide under law until recently.<br /><br />
As a matter of fact, Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, who delivered the Supreme Court opinion in the 1997 </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=180&amp;L=1275&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Washington v.

Swift, in his early 19th century treatise on the laws of Connecticut, stated that "[i]f one counsels another to commit suicide, and the other by reason of the advice kills himself, the advisor is guilty of murder as principal." â€¦ ("`The right to life and to personal security is not only sacred in the estimation of the common law, but it is inalienable'"). And the prohibitions against assisting suicide never contained exceptions for those who were near death. Rather, "[t]he life of those to whom life ha[d] become a burden-of those who [were] hopelessly diseased or fatally wounded-nay, even the lives of criminals condemned to death, [were] under the protection of law, equally as the lives of those who [were] in the full tide of life's enjoyment, and anxious to continue to live."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Things have certainly changed in the intervening twelve years, and not for the better.&#160; Now the United States has two states that have legitimized the act in law.

Back in 1956, large-scale human clinical trials of the birth control pill were begun in order to gain approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Gregory Pincus, a biologist who worked closely with Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood’s founder, chose Puerto Rico as the location for the human trials because it provided a large pool of poor, uneducated women who could be easily monitored. The local doctor in charge of the study told Pincus that the pill caused "too many side reactions to be generally acceptable." However, Pincus and Dr. John Rock, a Catholic ob-gyn who violated Church teachings by advocating contraception, dismissed her findings and did not investigate what caused the side effects, nor did they investigate the causes of the deaths that took place during the trials.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The pill killed women back before the pill was even "approved" in the U.S., and the pill continues to kill today.&#160; Why aren’t we hearing more about this?&#160; Could it be because of the millions of dollars invested in contraception?

Wortmanâ€™s medical bio states, â€œDr. Morris Wortman at The Center for Menstrual Disorders and Reproductive Choice offers services such as endomyometrial resection, GYN services, and pregnancy termination.â€ <br /><br />
Dr. Wortmanâ€™s â€œ</strong></font><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=161&amp;L=1145&amp;F=H"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>Holocaust Road</strong></font></a><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>â€ bio states that he is a child of Holocaust survivors and the coordinator of The Holocaust Study Group.<br /><br />
Dr. Wortmanâ€™s professional background shocked me into wondering how he could possibly be involved on one level with a project designed to remind America of the horror of the German Holocaust, while at the same time participating in the American holocaust, which has, by far, robbed many more innocent people of their lives.<br /><br />
I further wondered how representatives of the Diocese of Rochester, New York, could possibly justify collaborating on a project with a man known to the community, not only as the child of Holocaust survivors, but as a doctor who makes his living killing innocent babies prior to birth.<br /><br />
The day that the <em>Democrat and Chronicleâ€™s</em> article appeared, Eugene Michael of the <em>Rochester Catholic</em> took note of the same ironies. In a commentary entitled â€œ</strong></font><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=161&amp;L=1151&amp;F=H"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>DOR [Diocese of Rochester] Officials have Strange Bedfellows</strong></font></a><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>,â€ he wrote, </strong></font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>Todayâ€™s D&amp;C has an article about yet another interfaith collaboration in the Rochester area. This latest one involved the presentation of a program called "The Two Thousand Year Road to the Holocaust." The presentation took place at Temple Bâ€™rith Kodesh in Brighton. There are several aspects of this presentation that bear examination.<br /><br />
First of all, the presentation was part of a series of talks that has been spearheaded by Morris Wortman, one of Rochesterâ€™s most prominent abortionists. Wortman is not exactly shy and retiring when it comes to his advocacy for abortion. He has come out publicly a number of times in support of taking the lives of the unborn. In fact, because he is such a notorious abortionist, there is a pro-life Rosary prayed every Friday in front of his clinic. His clinic is also the destination for the annual </strong></font><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=161&amp;L=1155&amp;F=H"><em><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>Good Friday Stations of the Cross in Reparation for Abortion</strong></font></em></a><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>. <br /><br />
What is especially galling about this latest interfaith gathering was the participation of two local Catholic deacons. Both Deacon Thomas Driscoll and Deacon Anthony Sciolino were presenters at this forum. Here is what Deacon Sciolino had to say about the event:</strong></font></p><p style="margin-left: 80px"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>Something then went terribly wrong for Christianity during the Holocaust. And what resulted from the obvious disconnect between Christian belief and Christian behavior was the worst catastrophe in human history. Jews ponder the Holocaust and rightly ask: Where was God? Christians must to do the same and, in addition, ask: Where was the Church?</strong></font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>So, there you have it: an interfaith event, spearheaded by Rochesterâ€™s most prominent abortionist, at which one of the DORâ€™s deacons seems to blame Christianity and the Catholic Church for the Holocaust.<br /><br />
Many pro-life activists have characterized the taking of innocent life in the womb as the â€œabortion holocaust.â€ How unfortunate that these two deacons fail to see the irony of their collaboration with Dr. Wortman on this project.</strong></font></p><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>Sadly, I agree with every word that Mr. Michael has written, but I also feel strongly that if Deacon Sciolino truly wants to understand the tragedy of the first Holocaust, he should become familiar with the full body of facts required to support a credible presentation. As a Catholic, it is hard for me to see how Sciolino could blame Christianity for anything at all when millions of Christians were murdered during the Nazi atrocities as well.<br /><br />
At the same time, it is in the paradox of the collaboration between the abortionist and the Catholic deacons that the answer to this unexplainable association occurs. Their joint project is designed to raise awareness about the ugliness of murdering innocent people while avoiding the obvious contradiction that is occurring in their midst. <br /><br />
Sciolino, by deferring attention away from Wortmanâ€™s everyday practice and focusing in on the disconnect between Christian belief and Christian behavior, probably feels comfortable working side by side with a man who perpetrates the very same crimes against innocents that he is exposing in a partnership focused on the German Holocaust. Perhaps this same therapy of denial provides a healing salve to the conscience of the abortionist who can look the other way when confronted with the reality of what he does every day as he begs America to learn from the lessons of history and remember those who died more than 50 years ago.<br /><br />
Obviously, there are deep-seated reasons why some do not want to compare the Holocaust of yesterday with the Holocaust of today.<br /><br />
â€œStrange bedfellowsâ€ indeed! If I had to ask questions about this Rochester, New York conundrum, it would be Bishop Matthew Clark, shepherd of the Catholics entrusted to his care, to whom I would go for answers. I would ask quite simply</strong></font></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><strong>Your Excellency,<br />

"There aren't going to be prosecutions in this case, but there need to be changes," he said in the ArizonaCentral.com interview. <br /><br /></font></strong></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt" lang="EN"><a title="Permalink" target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1158&amp;F=H"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none"><strong><font size="3">Tension mounts over possible abortion referral at Boston Catholic&#160;hospitals</font></strong></span></a></span><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1159&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/may/09052115.html</font></strong></a><br /><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#808080">Life Site News<br /></font></span>Pro-life and Catholic advocates are voicing concern that Boston Catholic hospitals may soon refer for abortions as part of a joint medical venture it won last week, and which reportedly requires access to "family planning" services including abortion, contraception, and sterilization.&#160; The archdiocesan-owned Caritas Christi Health Care network first raised questions in February after it was revealed that the networks' hospitals had joined with Centene Corp. to bid on a state-subsidized health insurance contract, called the Commonwealth Family Health Plan.&#160; According to joint statements by Caritas/Centene, the contract requires access to abortion, contraception and sterilization, or at least referral for such services.&#160; The joint venture is expected to take effect July 1.<br />

Pro-Life Wisconsin's Dane County affiliate, along with Madison's Vigil for Life, prays outside the Madison Surgery Center on a regular basis.

However, it is not clear that the University of Wisconsin and its allies are backing down, at least not yet.<br /><br />
But something else occurred at the </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1163&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">UW Hospital</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> that has gone practically unnoticed by the wider community, and it is as troubling and depraved as the idea of approving late term abortions.&#160; According to recent reports,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">an advocacy group is alleging that doctors at UW Hospital broke the law by withholding treatment from two developmentally disabled patients with apparent cases of pneumonia.<br /><br />
The guardian of one patient, who survived, at first went along with and then later disagreed with the decision to withhold care, the lawsuit by Disability Rights Wisconsin alleges. The parents of the other patient, who died, pushed for the withdrawal of treatment, according to the groupâ€™s complaint filed Thursday in Dane County Circuit Court.<br /><br />
But a spokeswoman for UW Hospital said the hospital acted in the best interests of both patients and tried to follow the wishes of their familiesâ€¦.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The â€œtreatmentâ€ being discussed in these cases, by the way, is food and water!&#160; In other words, the patient was not dying from a condition, but would, and in one case did, die of starvation.&#160; What sort of medical care is that?<br /><br />
As the disability rights group </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1164&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Not Dead Yet</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> has pointed out, with this case and another in Pennsylvania of the same type, one has to wonder just how many such cases occur in hospitals around the nation but never come to the attention of advocates who might be able to help the helpless patient survive!&#160;&#160; <br /><br />
So what is going on at the University of Wisconsin-Madison?&#160; Is this a coincidence and nothing more than a fluke that the same university appears dedicated to the principle that vulnerable human beings, whether born or preborn, are frequently better off dead?&#160; <br /><br />
Clearly, the mentality that fosters a culture of death has taken hold at the university and, just like cancer, has spread from the expectant mothers in their care to the needy patients in their care who are helpless, and in some cases, have no one to defend their human dignity and their human rights.<br /><br />
The common denominator that links the disability rights case to the late term abortion facility is obvious.&#160; Disregard for the human person takes on all sorts of identities and excuses depending on who is setting the policies.&#160; If it is acceptable to kill the preborn, why not the already born who are in need of special care?&#160; As one </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=162&amp;L=1163&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">medical ethicist</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> put it, â€œHow much power do families and guardians have to make medical decisions for vulnerable patients such as children and the developmentally disabled?â€ <br /><br />
The answer is that if the vulnerable individual is a resident of his motherâ€™s womb, then that mother has total power to choose life or death for the child according to the law.&#160; And very soon the law that sanctions death at the beginning of life could well sanction it at any point during anotherâ€™s life, depending on whether or not the patient can speak up and defend himself.&#160; Such acts of course, will not, be defined as murder, but rather simply as exercises of a right to choose what is best for everyone involved.<br /><br />

This reality is characterized by the emergence of a culture which denies solidarity and in many cases takes the form of a veritable "culture of death". This culture is actively fostered by powerful cultural, economic and political currents which encourage an idea of society excessively concerned with efficiency. Looking at the situation from this point of view, it is possible to speak in a certain sense of a war of the powerful against the weak: a life which would require greater acceptance, love and care is considered useless, or held to be an intolerable burden, and is therefore rejected in one way or another. A person who, because of illness, handicap or, more simply, just by existing, compromises the well-being or life-style of those who are more favored tends to be looked upon as an enemy to be resisted or eliminated. In this way a kind of "conspiracy against life" is unleashed.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">The University of Wisconsin Hospital: this weekâ€™s winner as the best example of the â€œConspiracy Against Life.â€ It is a macabre moniker, but an honest one</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px">&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p style="font-weight: bold" align="center"><font size="6"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt"><font color="#ff0000"><font size="6">A.L.L.: </font><font size="6">NOTRE </font><font size="6">DAME'S ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES MOST AMERICANS</font></font></span></font></p><p><strong><font size="3">Washington, DC (18 May 2009) – <span style="font-style: italic">The following is a statement from Judie Brown, president of American Life League, regarding President Barack Obama’s commencement speech yesterday at the University of Notre Dame and the recent Gallup poll announcing that the majority of Americans self-identify as “pro-life.”</span><br /><br />
"Not only is the University of Notre Dame no longer Catholic, but a recent survey conducted by one of the nation’s most respected polling organizations shows that the school now recognizes as legitimate the pro-abortion position, which places it at odds with the majority of Americans.<br /><br />
When Notre Dame honored the most radically pro-abortion president in U.S. history, it publicly sanctioned the radically pro-abortion ideology he stands for – an ideology 51 percent of Americans oppose, according to a landmark new Gallup poll.<br /><br />
While Notre Dame graduates sat listening to the president expound his ideology of relativism and absence of truth, Catholics outside Notre Dame upheld the timeless truths of a faith that the leadership of Our Lady’s University no longer upholds.<br /><br />
Catholics outside Notre Dame stood for the human rights and personhood of all human beings from their biological beginning.<br /><br />
Catholics outside Notre Dame upheld the root of Catholic social teaching: the sanctity of human life.<br /><br />
Catholics outside Notre Dame were a witness to the truth that Notre Dame is no longer Catholic.<br /><br />
Catholics outside Notre Dame will no longer tolerate a “Catholic” educational institution that promotes intrinsic evil and undermines Catholic truth by embracing radical feminist, pro-abortion faculty and staff members and offering a pro-abortion culture.<br /></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Americans outside Notre Dame and nationwide will no longer tolerate a country that does not protect and defend the equality and personhood of each and every human being.<br /><br />
This monumental shift in American public opinion could never have happened without the incessant emphasis, by American Life League and others, on a consistent, uncompromising, unapologetic devotion to the truth that every human being has inherent dignity, immeasurable value and deserves to be recognized as a person."<br /><br />
American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Judie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.&#160; For more information or press inquiries, please contact Katie Walker at 540.659.4942. <br />

This is usually because there are no facts to support their position, having said that, we know that we can always expect rants from such people. There have been a couple of doozies this week.<br /><br />
Both of those bellowing are female, both have a long record of pro-abortion fanaticism, but both, in my humble opinion have gone off the deep end. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1069&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Missouri State Senator Joan Bray</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, for example, took off after pro-life male politicians in a manner that I have not heard about in a very long time. <br /><br />
The debate that occurred in the state senate focused on a piece of legislation that was originally supposed to protect the expectant mother seeking an abortion from coercion by the abortion provider. The current bill is so weak that pro-life activist/lobbyist Sam Lee has asked legislators not to vote for it. But that has not deterred </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1068&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Senator Bray</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. Bray was incensed by the very idea that such a law would even be proposed. During the debate, Senator Bray said, "A vote for this bill is a vote for the state to lie to these women in print. I'm sick of women being treated like they're so stupid that they can't be responsible for their own reproductive decisions."<br /><br />
Note that Bray did not expound on the reasons why expectant mothers do not need to know the dangers of aborting a child, but rather focused her comments on gibberish. We've heard all this before; it only occurs when pro-abortion zealots cannot defend their position. <br /><br />
Let's see what else Bray had to say: "I'm sick of women having no options, and being coerced to give birth."<br /><br />
Coercing a mother to give birth to her own child is a ridiculous premise. If the woman in question does not wish to bear a child, then she can take steps to avoid the situation that brings about pregnancy. Bray is the one insulting women, at least in this case:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">"I'm sick of a bunch of men around here, year after year after year, piling up restriction after restriction after restriction on women who found themselves in a very unhappy, unpleasant circumstance of an unwanted pregnancy."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">How did these expectant mothers find themselves in this circumstance? I think we know exactly how it happened, and again, we know that people of both sexes know how to avoid it. The preborn child is not the cause of unhappiness, unpleasantness or unwantedness; he or she did not have a say in the matter. However the female and the male did, Senator Bray. Think about it. <br /><br />
Senator Bray again: "I am sick of the disrespect for women who come to the Capitol defending a woman's legal right to choose an abortion."<br /><br />
Aha! You see, we finally got to her point. Bray is not going to advocate abstinence until marriage, fidelity within marriage or any of the qualities that predispose self-respect and respect for the other person. No, Bray just wants unrestricted access to abortion on demand. <br /><br />
Yes, Senator Bray is sick, but not because of the defense of preborn children that she is hearing and not because of the sincere concerns some lawmakers have about expectant mothers whose health and well-being will be at risk if they decide to abort their children. In fact, it seems to me that Senator Bray is sick to death of the growing number of pro-life advocates in the state legislature and has chosen to lash out at them in a manner similar to a cat fight â€¦ though there is but one of the usual two feline contenders in this fight.<br /><br />
The idea of tying "responsibility" to the notion of solving a problem by killing a person has been around since the struggle between pro-life and pro-death forces began. But now that the pro-life movement is making appreciable gains in public sentiment and political commitment, things are looking bad for the Brays of the world. I think the poor lady needs a vacation.<br /><br />
Using a single speech to attack her peers, suggesting that they are disrespectful toward members of the opposite sex smacks of disingenuousness. <br /><br />
Perhaps Senator Bray's bigotry against pro-life men comes about because she is too committed to rhetorical zealotry and has lost her ability to be civil. I don't know, but it certainly appears that way.<br /><br />

In that memorandum <br />
they are urged, after careful examination of the situation with a particular pro-abortion public figure, to take proper action to deny Holy Communion to such people. </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1081&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Church law does not exist to be ignored</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">; it exists to be enforced and there are no exceptions.<br /><br />
Frances Kissling, like Senator Bray, is up in arms. She is all about name-calling, denigrating those with whom she disagrees and lobbing verbal cannon balls toward those of us who truly understand the difference between good and evil.&#160; Truth makes Frances uncomfortable in the same way it makes Senator Bray uncomfortable. <br /><br />
The truth about which I write does not belong to me; it belongs to no human being but is, rather, that truth that is </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1074&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">written on the heart</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> of every human being by God Himself. <br /><br />
This is the fundamental difference between these two ladies and those of us who are committed to that truth. Frances cannot articulate a strong, viable defense of Harry Knox in view of the documentation that was provided to President Obama. And so, like Bray, she resorts to vilifying the messengers so that she can ignore the message. <br /><br />
Disrespect, bias and twisted zealotry grow in a garden sown with seeds of deceit. Such language maligns, but never counters, intellectual honesty. The Kisslings and Brays of our world are sad figures, not only because they have resorted to tactics like those noted here, but because they are human beings who are loved by God and who have somehow lost their way. Let us pray for them and for those who accept what they say without questioning it.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Judie Brown is president of American Life League and a member of the Pontifical Academy for Life.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1082&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Respond to Judie<br /></font></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=152&amp;L=1082&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">http://www.all.org/newsroom_judieblog_response.php?id=2607</font></strong></a></p><p>&#160;&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong>Volume 6, Number 19</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong> Monday May 11, 2009</strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">ASSOCIATES FROM THE AMERICAN LIFE LEAGUE</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Please join me in welcoming the newest addition to our Associate network – We the People for Life – currently directed by Karen Reynoso and located in Norco, California!&#160; We the People for Life was formed in February when a number of concerned pro-lifers who had gathered to participate in a very successful 40 Days for Life Campaign felt called to continue their work.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">During the 40 Days for Life campaign, almost 450 people from 50 different churches participated, seventeen women changed their minds and did not abort their children and one security guard quit working at the Planned Parenthood clinic.&#160; Several of the campaign participants were also able to facilitate post-abortion recovery.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">We the People for Life now plans to provide pro-life education and distribute pro-life materials throughout the community, provide a regular ongoing prayer presence at the clinic and provide sidewalk counseling training.&#160; We are very excited to have them in the Associate Program and we look forward to working with them in their future endeavors!</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><br /><strong><font size="3">National Pro-life T-shirt Week<br />

Often times the pill can cause a woman to develop deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in a vein. The blood clot can block the blood supply to the heart or brain, which could result in heart attack, stroke or death. The clot can also travel to the lungs, which could then result in pulmonary embolism or death. Women have died as a direct result of taking the pill. That having been said, there are still many unanswered questions regarding whether or not the pill was at least partially responsible for more deaths than we can document. A thorough investigation should be done, not only because the pill has dangerous side effects, but because we should protect the health and wellbeing of women in general in the United States.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">We are encouraging people to protest outside of doctors’ offices, pharmacies, Planned Parenthood clinics and other family planning facilities, or even out on the sidewalk at a busy intersection.

Personally, I had the most remarkable mother that any human being could ever hope to have. My mom, Bertha, was a solidly faithful, courageous and loving woman who gave her all to her daughters and to her son. My brother was with us for such a brief period of time, but each day was so special for all of us. There is not a day that goes by that I do not reflect on how my mother cared for that special little boy, my brother Mark, who's Down syndrome weakened his small body and made it impossible for him to fight off a common cold. Even during his illness and death, my mother was a beacon of love in the midst of her sorrow and her pain. <br /><br />
I have fond memories of my mom, memories that have constantly reminded me that there is no better role model for me than her. So on this coming Mother's Day I will not only appreciate my own children in a special way, but once again my mom.<br /><br />
It is a sad commentary on our times that so many young mothers will never have the opportunity to be embraced by their children, or learn valuable lessons from their children, or appreciate the wonder of a child who grows up to become a fine, upstanding member of the human race. Such mothers will miss so much in their lives because they chose to end their child's life before birth rather than welcome and affirm the gift of that child.<br /><br />
While the acceptance and advocacy of abortion is, if nothing else, a testimony to our current cultural attitudes toward parenthood and the rejection of the blessing of giving of one's self for the benefit of another, there are movements afoot to change all that. More expectant mothers today are carrying their babies to term than ever before. Fewer of them are exercising their choice to </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=139&amp;L=975&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">kill</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">. <br /><br />
But that does not mean that the abortion industry is asleep at the wheel. Far from it, as Planned Parenthood made perfectly clear in its most recent e-mail blast asking for money. The hook was </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=139&amp;L=974&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Judy Blume</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, an active supporter of PP and author of numerous children's books. Blume wrote, "</font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=139&amp;L=979&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">There is no organization that I know of that supports motherhood and all that it means more than PP</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">." <br /><br />
What a perfect example of society's disdain for what it really means to be a mother.<br /><br />
Commenting on Blume's inane statement, </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=139&amp;L=977&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3"><em>Wednesday STOPP Report</em> </font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">editor Marie Hahnenberg writes, </font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Sure, we could just laugh when we read this, because we all know this is so far from the truth. But this is nothing to laugh about. PP has murdered over 4,000,000 babies in the United States. PP has no clue as to what motherhood is all about.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Indeed! As is always the case, harbingers of gloom, doom and destruction never saw a special day they could not corrupt with their messages of death. Having said that, I have to admit it is my firm conviction that such organizations are on the way to defeat. They know it and thus find it necessary to use every opportunity they can to entice the uninformed into believing that there is something good and self-satisfying about killing your own child before he is born. As tragic as this is, we know that evil will not triumph at the end of the day. In the meantime, it is taking its toll and we need to not only be mindful of it, but prayerful about it. <br /><br />

We thank You for our mothers to whom You have entrusted the care of every precious human life from its very beginning in the womb.<br /><br />
You have given to woman the capacity of participating with You in the creation of new life. Grant that every woman may come to understand the full meaning of that blessing, which gives her an unlimited capacity for selfless love for every child she may be privileged to bear, and for all Your children.<br /><br />
Watch over every mother who is with child, strengthen her faith in Your fatherly care and love for her and for her unborn baby. Give her courage in times of fear or pain, understanding in times of uncertainty and doubt, and hope in times of trouble. Grant her joy in the birth of her child.<br /><br />
To mothers You have given the great privilege and responsibility of being a child's first teacher and spiritual guide. Grant that all mothers may worthily foster the faith of their children, following the example of Mary, Elizabeth, and other holy women who follow Christ. Help mothers to grow daily in knowledge and understanding of Your Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, and grant them the wisdom to impart this knowledge faithfully to their children, and to all who depend upon them.<br /><br />
Assist all "spiritual mothers", those who, though they may have no children of their own, nevertheless selflessly care for the children of others â€“ of every age and state in life. Grant that they may know the joy of fulfilling this motherly calling of women, whether in teaching, nursing, religious life, or in other work which recognizes and fosters the true dignity of every human being created in Your image and likeness.<br /><br />
We beseech You to send Your Holy Spirit, the Comforter, to all mothers who sorrow for children that have died, are ill or estranged from their families, or who are in trouble or danger of any kind. Help grieving mothers to rely on Your tender mercy and fatherly love for all your children.<br /><br />
We ask your blessing on all those to whom You have entrusted motherhood. May Your Holy Spirit constantly inspire and strengthen them. May they ever follow the example of Mary, mother of Our Lord, and imitate her fidelity, her humility, and her self-giving love. May all mothers receive Your Grace abundantly in this earthly life, and may they look forward to eternal joy in Your presence in the life to come.<br /><br />
We ask this through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end.

Airman 1st Class Scott Boie (BOH'-ee) of Milton, Wis., had faced more than 26 years confinement at his sentencing Saturday. Beside his 9 1/2 year sentence, Boie also was dishonorably discharged. Master Sgt. Demetrius Lester says Boie was convicted in a court-martial Friday night of attempting to kill an unborn child. Boie was found not guilty of intentionally killing the unborn child. That charge carries a maximum sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Boie's attorneys have said his wife's history of smoking and troubled pregnancies may have caused last year's miscarriage. <br /><br /><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 18pt">Listen to </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 18pt">On the Edge</span></em></font></strong><span><strong><font size="3"> Tuesdays at 1:00 p.m. ET at </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=317&amp;N=71&amp;L=6&amp;F=H"><span><strong><font size="3">www.NPLR.net<br /></font></strong></span></a><u><br /></u></span><strong><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">Your host, </span><span style="font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">Eric Martin, and co-hosts&#160;Michael Hichborn and&#160;Katie Walker will educate, motivate, mobilize&#160;and often entertain you for&#160;60 minutes every Tuesday at 1:00&#160;p.m. ET on NPLR.net, as well as other Internet and&#160;AM radio stations&#160;that rebroadcast the show.</span></font></strong></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><strong><font size="3"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">On The Edge&#160;</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">is a fast-paced, roundtable discussion among the new generation of pro-life experts who work every day in the trenches of the movement, focus&#160;on current events, news, politics&#160;and dozens of American Life League programs.&#160; </span></font></strong></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">Each show features a rapid-fire rant from <em><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'">ALL Report</span></em>'<em><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'">s </span></em>Michael Hichborn called "On the Soapbox," as well as plain-English explanations and commentary on issues facing&#160;Americans as they confront the civil rights movement's last campaign: the establishment of personhood for the preborn.</font></strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><strong><font size="3"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">On The Edge</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt"> is brought to you by American Life League's generous supporters, without whom&#160;this show would not be possible.

American Life League's young leaders have experienced some of this firsthand in South Bend, but it has not deterred them. Many others, like us, who are also focused on this problem, have heard and seen more than could ever have been imagined, and not much of it is positive.<br /><br />
My favorite is the e-mail I received from a gentleman who said,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">What do you suggest Catholics do, bury their heads in the sand, and only talk and listen to those who agree with us?

Remember Cardinal Egan ate at table with Obama at the Al Smith Dinner.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">In responding to him, I explained that we Catholics are not ostriches; but we are people who believe that there is a time and a place to expose the horror of an abortion-supporting politician's views. Having said that, we do not think a graduation ceremony at an identifiably Catholic institution is the place for this to occur. Notre Dame could have invited the president to debate his views with a pro-life politician, or they could have hosted a town-hall lecture during which those students who know that abortion is an act of murder could have voiced their position and perhaps helped the president understand the error of his ways. But graduation? <br /><br />
While I am not sure what the Great Wall of China has to do with this, I certainly do recall the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner at which Cardinal Egan was photographed while apparently mesmerized by Obama. It is not my favorite photo of a prince of the Church; that's for sure.

But he didn't give them a platform to preach to the faithful. That's the difference here."<br /><br />
Indeed, that is the difference and the specific reason why ALL is working with the Cardinal Newman Society and other like-minded organizations to expose this and press for even a last-minute cancellation of the invitation. But if that fails, then as our </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=842&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">petition to Bishop D'Arcy of Ft.

Notre Dame should be removed from the list of Catholic institutions, not only because its actions are discordant with the Catholic faith, but because it is scandalizing the very minds it is supposed to be molding and offering them â€“ instead of Catholic truth â€“ relativism, liberalism and a consistent pattern of behavior incompatible with Catholic teaching.</font></strong></p><p><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=923&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">ALL</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> is sponsoring an event this evening in South Bend at which we will focus on â€œthe sins of Notre Dame." As ALL's leadership director, Michael Barnett, explains, â€œNotre Dame is placing the souls of millions in jeopardy in exchange for their own prestige. The school has no right to sell itself as Catholic to donors and potential students while simultaneously working to undermine the Church and honor the most pro-abortion president in the nation's history.â€<br /><br />

These decisions have sent a shamefully ambiguous message concerning Notre Dame's fidelity to the Church's teaching on the sacredness of human life and the dignity of the human person. As an example of this, one does not need to look further than Notre Dame's decision last year to ignore Bishop D'Arcy's call to cancel the lewd "V-Monologues" with its mockery of Catholic teaching on human sexuality. <br /><br />
It is my intent not to support Catholic formation programs offered at Notre Dame until its leadership discontinues making decisions that are inconsistent with the promotion of the Catholic Church's teachings on the sacredness of human life.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">We are so very grateful for these profound words and for the outpouring of similar sentiments from nearly 60 princes of the Catholic Church. <br /><br />
Sadly, however, the Notre Dame scandal, while the most egregious I have seen at a supposedly Catholic institution, is not unique. As a matter of fact, the Obama invitation is simply the most horrific example of the decaying respect for Catholic truth that appears to have infected more than a few Catholic campuses. As we go to press today, for example, we learn that the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit institution, is hosting </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=927&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">South African Bishop Kevin Dowling</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">, who has, according to a Cardinal Newman Society press release, "publicly criticized abstinence-only programs and supports condom use by those infected with or at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS."<br /><br />
Defiance has reared its ugly head in the Diocese of Scranton as well. Several months ago, </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=928&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Bishop Joseph Martino</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> reprimanded U.S. Senator Robert Casey, a pro-abortion Catholic Democrat, for his position on abortion. In what is clearly an affront to Bishop Martino's directive, the Catholic college, King's College invited </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=929&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Senator Casey</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> to deliver the commencement address to its graduates. <br /><br />
Responding to this, the ever-courageous Bishop Martino said,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">I do not believe he [Casey] has the moral stature to stand before the graduates of a Catholic college to address them about their futures and the challenges they will face when on the most important issue of the dayâ€”the sanctity of human life â€” he cannot muster the courage to oppose the pro-abortion agenda which is currently being promoted in Washington.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">While some so-called Catholics stand up and shout that efforts to get Obama disinvited or have the University of Notre Dame removed from <em>The Official Catholic Directory</em> are tantamount to crawling into a bunker and hiding from the real world, thousands of believing Catholics are calling for an end to the madness. We're not buried in the mind warp of dissent and dislike for all things Catholic; we are simply sick and tired of business as usual. Rather than being ensconced in political correctness, those of us who decry the Notre Dame scandal and similar debacles do so because we love Christ; we love the Church, and we are ready to surrender our very lives in defense of the Church. <br /><br />
We recognize that the unfaithful current leaders of institutions such as the University of Notre Dame and the University of San Francisco actually represent wolves in sheep's clothing, prowling the highways and byways seeking out souls that can be misguided and misled, all in the name of academic freedom. In this conflict between Catholic truth and the "</font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=934&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">father of lies</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3">,"many of us are calling for an end to the madness.

The mainstream media may not get it, and perhaps they never will. But that is truly irrelevant at this time of crisis in the Church. As long as Catholic bishops, national organizations like the Cardinal Newman Society, American Life League and media sources with integrity such as Life Site News are shining a light in the darkness, we need not fear, tremble or become discouraged. No bunkers for us! </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=134&amp;L=931&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Pope Benedict XVI</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> reminded us several years ago,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Life is not only given at the moment of death and not only in the manner of martyrdom.

Day by day I must learn to abandon myself; to keep myself available for whatever he, the Lord, needs of me at a given moment, even if other things seem more appealing and more important to me: it means giving life, not taking it. <br /><br />
It is in this very way that we experience freedom: freedom from ourselves, the vastness of being. In this very way, by being useful, in being a person whom the world needs, our life becomes important and beautiful.

So-called personhood amendments do not seek to give more information to women or counsel them to seek alternatives to abortion. Instead, such bills challenge the U.S. Supreme Court â€˜s 1973 <em>Roe v. Wade</em> ruling.<br /><br />
This argument is not really an argument but an explanation of what opponents see as the major defect in proposed human personhood amendments. But it is erroneous. The effort to pursue human personhood challenges both of the 1973 Supreme Court decisions at their core, not the periphery. We are certain that if the Supreme Court took </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=129&amp;L=892&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="3">Blackmun's</font></strong></a><strong><font size="3"> argument seriously, <em>Roe</em>, <em>Doe </em>and their progeny would fall. Therefore, giving more information to women or counseling them to seek alternatives to abortion is a need that is separate from defending human personhood. In fact, once human personhood is recognized in the law, abortion itself would be defined as a crime against human rights, civil rights and equal rights. It would, in fact, be recognized as the act of murder that it is.<br /><br />
A second argument against pursuing human personhood goes like this:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">As it stands, there is still a majority on the Court that would uphold decriminalized abortion. Not only would an unfavorable decision strengthen abortion-â€œrightsâ€ case law, but it also invites the Court to define when life begins, which they have not done to date.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">This argument is based on a total lack of understanding of the impact the Supreme Courtâ€™s post-1973 abortion decisions have had. After all, each such decision has recognized the legitimacy of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and <em>Doe v. Bolton</em> by recognizing the legal status of abortion. As the five Catholic Supreme Court justices said in the </font></strong><a target="_blank" xcomment="target=_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=129&amp;L=893&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="3">Gonzales v. Carhart</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="3">&#160; decision,</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn. The Act's ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government's objectives. No one would dispute that, for many, D&amp;E is a procedure itself laden with the power to devalue human life. Congress could nonetheless conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">Obviously, the Supreme Court is strengthening abortion â€œrightsâ€ every time any case involving abortion comes its way! As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the legitimacy of abortion as long as the "undue burden" does not affect a mother's â€œrightâ€ to kill her preborn child. So, arguing that personhood proposals would somehow set the pro-life movement back is ridiculous!<br /><br />
Furthermore, the Supreme Court has not been asked to address the scientific evidence regarding when a human being begins since 1971, when it heard the oral arguments preceding its 1973 decisions. At that time, the Court simply refused to hear the facts. <br />
&#160;<br />
Here is a third argument against personhood proposals:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">Ultimately, it will be public sentiment that will bring an end to abortion in the United States and not forced, untimely or imprudent legislation. The incrementalist strategy is sound, prudent and effective, and â€¦ it gives far more than it takes.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">To argue that focusing on the central fact that aborting a preborn child is wrong because that child is a human person is not forced, untimely or imprudent. It is accurate, hopeful and necessary. Arguments that suggest otherwise expose the sordid truth that at least a few pro-life leaders are repeatedly leading pro-life Americans to agree that abortion for rape, incest and the life of the mother is acceptable. Such an incrementalist position provides the Courts with additional reasons to affirm <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. <br /><br />
Those who oppose personhood proposals are lost in a rhetorical fog, and to that we say, please let us help you find your way!<br /><br />
The fourth argument comes from a Catholic priest who opposes the human personhood effort:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="3">The question we must ask ourselves is this: What is greater â€“ my uncompromised moral position or the innocent lives of the unborn?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">This is perhaps one of the most tired, self-serving statements I have seen. Oddly enough, it always comes from those who refuse to address the factual evidence regarding the personhood of the preborn child. If we as pro-life Americans are honest, and I think most of us are, we would take the time to examine what has contributed to the perpetuation of what the Supreme Court refers to as protecting abortion when an "undue burden" is imposed on expectant mothers. Clearly, the Court, like most culture-of -death proponents, finds it more "realistic" to continue the status quo than to bite the bullet and join with those of us who have changed course and do recognize that the past 36 years have delivered defeat after defeat for preborn human persons.<br /><br />
The "uncompromised moral position" is that our pro-life identity obligates us to do all we can to focus on the human person whose existence is acknowledged by so few, to recognize his individuality and humanize him for one and all. Regulating the murder of these preborn persons by employing flawed incrementalist propositions will not accomplish this goal. Such proposals actually contradict personhood and are designed to appease politicians, not save the preborn. How can a single one of us be satisfied with regulating what is, at its core, an act of murder? <br /><br />
So, while some will continue to argue against the pursuit of human personhood for any number of trumped-up reasons, the human personhood movement will be guided by the lessons it has learned from the failures of those who have surrendered to the Supreme Courtâ€™s version of what human beings should and should not be, based on a totally false "undue burden" argument.<br /><br />
May those who seek to undermine the human personhood movement recognize the facts and acknowledge the failures of the past. May they finally understand that merely regulating such a heinous crime has resulted in death and perpetuated the "undue burden" myth. May they examine their opposition and see what we see â€¦ a positive, proactive affirmation of human beings whose civil rights, human rights and equal rights are being violated at least 3,000 times a day, 365 days a year, by acts of murder â€¦ acts of abortion.<br /><br />

On June 6, 2009, men, women and men across the country will take a stand against the birth control pill at pharmacies, drug stores, Planned Parenthoods and other so-called family planning businesses nationwide.<br /><br />
“Research shows women using oral contraceptives have five times greater risk of death from cardiovascular causes,” said Marie Hahnenberg, a researcher for American Life League.<br /><br />

&#160;“How many of these 21,813 women were on the pill, or at one point in their lives had been on the pill?”<br /><br />
“The federal government has a moral obligation to conduct research on this question and to modify the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death so that the right questions are asked,” Hahnenberg continued. ““We have reports of women who have died from the birth control pill and other birth control products and others are suffering terrible side effects which could lead to death. Women need to be informed about the truth behind this dangerous drug.” <br /><br />
Protest the Pill Day is the largest protest ever against the birth control pill and other birth control products. Last year, participants across the United States shared the facts on exactly how the pill kills babies. This year, the event will expose the sordid details surrounding the tragic effects these chemicals have on women.<br /><br />

Excerpts from <em>The Winning Side</em> by Charles E. Rice</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Is it possible to be unconditionally pro-life in the United States today?&#160; Since <span style="font-style: italic">Roe v. Wade</span>, in 1973, legalized abortion has delivered a body count of a least 49 million, not including deaths from uncountable abortions by hormonal contraception.&#160; And we have legalized euthanasia, notwithstanding the false optimism generated by the Supreme Court’s refusal to discover a “right to die” in the Constitution. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The immediate pro-life response to <span style="font-style: italic">Roe </span>was, properly, to undo that ruling by constitutional amendment or legislation.&#160; Those efforts have failed.&#160; And, in seeking incremental restrictions on abortion rather than its prohibition, the establishment pro-life movement has implicitly accepted the basic premise of <span style="font-style: italic">Roe</span>, that the unborn child is a nonperson whose execution can be legitimately tolerated by the state.&#160; In any event, technology is moving abortion and euthanasia beyond the effective reach of the law.&#160; They are truly becoming matters of private choice. </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Legalized abortion and euthanasia, however, are symptoms.&#160; In a culture dominated by a relativist and utilitarian contraceptive ethic, it is predictable that man will make himself (or herself) the arbiter of the ending as well as the beginning of life.&#160; A national moral meltdown has accelerated the dominance of the culture of death.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Choosing to be unconditionally pro-life is difficult because of these cultural and constitutional developments.&#160; But the choice is inescapable.&#160; There appears to be an increasing return to a radical choice for humanity, not unlike the one represented in the first centuries of the Christian era.&#160; We can, even today, be unconditionally pro-life through the gift of self, in faith, to God and to others.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Mis-education has caused many to be unable or unwilling to distinguish objective wrong from subjective culpability.&#160; Many seem to think that nothing is wrong “for you” unless you “feel” it is wrong.&#160; But the intentional killing of an innocent human being is always objectively wrong.&#160; It is contrary to natural justice, the revealed law of God and the common good of society, regardless of the motive or other subjective dispositions of the killer.&#160; We do no favor to the person contemplating abortion when we encourage her to decide according to her feelings.&#160; It is a lie to pretend that abortion can ever be anything but an objective evil.&#160; </font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The natural law dictates that human law can never legitimately tolerate the intentional killing of innocent human beings.&#160; This principle, which allows no exception, also implies the law’s duty to protect all innocent life.&#160; If human laws are just, they bind in conscience.&#160; But if a human law “deflects from the law of nature,” it is unjust “and is no longer a law but a perversion of law.”&#160; Laws authorizing the intentional killing of the innocent are unjust because they withdraw from the potential victim the even-handed protection of the law to which he is entitled.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">Confusion can also arise from a failure to distinguish the objective merits of pro-life legislative proposals from the motives of those who advocate them.&#160; Prominent leaders in the pro-life movement have spent at least two decades validating the pro-death premise that the law may legitimately allow the intentional killing of innocent human beings.&#160; They began by conceding the legality of abortion to save the life of the mother.&#160; They have ended by proposing only marginal restrictions on otherwise unlimited abortion.&#160; When the “pro-life” movement itself concedes that the intentional killing of the innocent is politically negotiable, how can we be surprised at the impotence of that movement in confronting euthanasia?&#160; The futility of the establishment pro-life movement arises basically from its refusal to condemn the objective wrong of contraception.&#160; In contraception man makes himself, rather than God, the arbiter of life’s beginning.&#160; Why is anyone surprised when he makes himself the arbiter also of its end?&#160; The elimination of the unwanted at both ends of life will be a predictable response to the problems caused by an excess of old people and a shortage of workers to support them, a shortage directly resulting from contraception and abortion.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12px"><strong><font size="3">The pro-life movement lost the war [when] it chose to fight on the enemy’s terms.&#160; Early abortifacient technology, however, signals a new war in which abortion and euthanasia will be a truly private choice.&#160; This war can be won only through a reconversion of the American people to respect for life as a gift of God.&#160; The pro-life movement can contribute to that reconversion only if it bears witness to the truth without compromise of principle.</font></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial;
