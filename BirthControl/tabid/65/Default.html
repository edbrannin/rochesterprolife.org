<p align="center"><font color="#0000ff" size="5">"Birth Control Pills" cause early Abortions</font></p>
<p align="center">By J.T. Finn (updated April 23, 2005)</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Physicians across America -- and around the world -- are now confirming that the Pill, IUDs, Depo-Provera and Norplant cause early abortions.</strong></p>
<p align="center">First, a look at the Pill. Research shows that in many cases the Pill causes early abortions -- abortions the mother may not even know she's having. You may find this shocking, but the facts are clear after reading Randy Alcorn's book, titled;</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">"Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?"</font></p>
<p align="center">Here's what 11 physicians and medical professionals are saying about the book Randy Alcorn published in 1998:</p>
<p align="center">1. "From medical textbooks and pharmacy references, to statements from the Pill-manufacturers themselves, this book proves, beyond any doubt, the abortion-causing action of birth control pills. This book should be read by everyone interested in knowing the truth."</p>
<p align="center">~ Paul L. Hayes, M.D., Board Certified Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians/Gynecologists</p>
<p align="center">2. "Does the birth control pill cause abortions? Using research results from medical literature, Randy Alcorn has convincingly shown that the answer is `yes.' He has, with care and compassion, given us the truth. The question for us as Christians is how we will respond now that we know."</p>
<p align="center">~ Linda Martin, M.D., Pediatrician</p>
<p align="center">3. "By carefully detailing the available medical information concerning the abortifacient effects of oral contraceptives, Randy Alcorn has developed a logical and thoughtful challenge to every prolife person. The conclusions of this study are scientifically accurate. Birth control pills usually prevent pregnancy, but sometimes they cause an abortion. Questions? Objections? Randy has addressed them in a gentle but firm way. This is the manner in which the often fiery debate over prolife subjects should be carried out- unemotionally, intelligently and quietly. The evidence is before us . . . `How should we then live?'"</p>
<p align="center">~ Patrick D. Walker, M.D., Professor of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences</p>
<p align="center">4. "In this challenging book Randy Alcorn has the honesty to face a tough and uncomfortable question. This compelling evidence will make you rethink the question of birth control pills."</p>
<p align="center">~ John Brose, M.D., Surgeon</p>
<p align="center">5. "In this impeccably researched book, Randy Alcorn takes an unblinking look at what medical experts know about how birth control pills work. I painfully agree that birth control pills do in fact cause abortions. Our individual and collective Christian response to this heretofore varnished-over information will have profound consequences for time and eternity. This is a disturbing must-read for all who profess to be prolife."</p>
<p align="center">~ Beverly A. McMillan, M.D., Ob/Gyn</p>
<p align="center">6. "Randy Alcorn has done exceptional work. The facts in this book parallel much of my own research. I am delighted he would undertake such a work when others seek to avoid the subject. This book is a must for Christians, particularly those in medicine and Christian ministries."</p>
<p align="center">~ Karen D. Garnett, R.N.</p>
<p align="center">7. "No prolife physician can rightly prescribe BCPs [birth control pills] after reviewing this data. I have started circulating this information."</p>
<p align="center">~ Randall Martin, M.D., Chairman, Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia Willamette Valley Medical Center</p>
<p align="center">8. "Scientific papers suggest that escape ovulation occurs 4-15% of all cycles in patients taking birth control pills. Thus, as this booklet points out, early chemical abortions are a real and significant concern."</p>
<p align="center">~ Paddy Jim Baggot, M.D., Ob/Gyn, Fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics</p>
<p align="center">9. "Randy Alcorn has thoroughly studied and written on an area where little published scientific information exists. His responses to this issue, and his outstanding appendices, are must reading."</p>
<p align="center"><br />
~ William M. Petty, M.D., Surgeon, Gynecologic Oncology</p>
<p align="center">10. "Randy Alcorn has once again demonstrated his tenacity and integrity in pursuing the truth. He has exposed the abortifacient properties of so-called birth control agents. This booklet should be required reading for all discerning Christians who wish to fully live out their faith."</p>
<p align="center"><br />
~ William L. Toffler, M.D., Professor of Family Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University</p>

<p align="center">Again, if you're reading about CHEMICAL ABORTIONS for the first time, this may surprise, or even shock you. Most Americans are not aware that the Pill and other chemical "contraceptives" cause millions of "non-surgical" abortions each year in the early weeks of pregnancy. If you are using the Pill, Depo-Provera or Norplant, you need to know the truth about how these products work.</p>
<p align="center">Most women take these "contraceptives" because they don't want to have a baby. But how many women know they can have BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS and become pregnant while using these "contraceptives?" Very few! And how many of these women know that if they become pregnant after a BREAKTHROUGH OVULATION, these "contraceptives" will almost always kill any son or daughter they've conceived?</p>
<p align="center">Most people don't know the real facts about how "contraceptives" work. And because of this lack of knowledge, most women are not aware that they may be having BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS, and conceiving children that are killed very early in the pregnancy. Women using these "contraceptives" almost never perceive that they have become pregnant, or that chemicals have killed their tiny baby.</p>
<p align="center">&#160;</p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="4">What is Breakthrough Ovulation?</font></strong></p>
<p align="center">While using the Pill and other chemical "birth control" products, many women's ovaries continue to release eggs. This is called "Breakthrough Ovulation" and it occurs in millions of women each year. Once an egg has been released via ovulation, a woman can become pregnant.</p>
<p align="center">&#160;</p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="4">You can still conceive a child . . .</font></strong></p>
<p align="center">If you're using "birth control" products and you have a breakthrough ovulation that releases an egg, sperm can then reach and fertilize your egg. At that moment -- you would be pregnant! Fertilization means conception has taken place and you now have a brand new son or daughter who is as complete genetically as he or she will ever be throughout life.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="4">When Does Human Life Begin?</font></strong></p>
<p align="center">Internationally-known geneticists and biologists have testified that human life begins at conception. In 1981 (April 23-24) a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings on the question: When does human life begin? The following doctors testified:</p>
<p align="center">Dr. Hymie Gordon, Chairman of the Department of Genetics at the Mayo Clinic, said: "By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception."</p>
<p align="center">Dr. McCarthy de Mere, a medical doctor and law professor at the University of Tennessee, testified: "The exact moment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception."</p>
<p align="center">Dr. Jerome Lejeune, The Father of Modern Genetics, testified that, "Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon we call the DNA."</p>
<p align="center">The late Dr. Lejeune of Paris, France, discovered the genetic cause of Down Syndrome. He received the Kennedy Prize for this discovery, as well as the Memorial Allen Award Medal, the world's highest award for work in the field of Genetics.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="4">How does the Pill work?</font></strong></p>
<p align="center">The Pill has three mechanisms of action which can easily be looked up in the Physician's Desk Reference.</p>
<p align="center">1) Sometimes, the Pill suppresses ovulation. When this happens, an egg is not released and conception cannot occur. (It's important to read on and find out about the high rates of breakthrough ovulation. When ovulation is not suppressed, pregnancy can occur.)</p>
<p align="center"><br />
2) The Pill also works to thicken the woman's cervical mucus which can "restrict" sperm from moving up the reproductive tract toward the egg.</p>
<p align="center"><br />
3) One way the Pill causes early abortions is that it interfers with the flexing motions and the cilia movement of the fallopian tubes. These changes slow the transportation of newly conceived child from the fallopian tubes to the womb. Unfortunately, many small babies starve to death in the fallopian tubes because chemicals caused changes that prevented them from reaching the womb in time to be nourished.</p>
<p align="center">4) Another way the Pill causes early abortions: If your tiny baby survives the ride down the fallopian tube to your womb, the Pill will almost always cause the endometrium (the lining of your uterus) to reject your child. Chemical reactions often cause the lining of your womb to become thin, shriveled and unable to support implantation of your newly conceived child.</p>
<p align="center">This means that in almost every case, your new child will not be able to attach to the wall of your womb where he or she would normally live, grow and receive nourishment for 9 months. This means your tiny baby will starve to death and his or her remains will be passed along in your next bleeding cycle. (The "Study of Abortion Deaths Commission" estimates that this happens in women in America who use the Pill approximately 1 to 4 million times each year.)</p>
<p align="center">The chemicals that cause these early abortions are called abortifacients which is the medical term for any chemical agent that causes an abortion.</p>

<strong>Depo-Provera, Norplant and IUDs</strong></p>
<p>Depo-Provera and Norplant both use chemicals that work in very simlar ways on a woman's body and womb. Depo-Provera and Norplant are also considered chemical abortifacients.</p>
<p>IUDs or Intra-Uterine Devices, are small plastic devices that are inserted into the womb. Some IUDs contain copper or a time released hormone. It is believed that the IUD causes a low grade inflammation in the lining of the womb. As a result, the lining of the womb is imperfect and the fertilized egg will not implant. (Source: This paragraph on IUDs is quoted directly from the Calgary Regional Health Authority's web site.)</p>
<p>Because of the chemical effect an IUD has on a woman's womb, tiny babies are aborted. Therefore, IUDs are also considered abortifacients.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Breakthrough ovulation proved long ago . . .</strong></p>
<p>Birth control advocates and manufacturers of the Pill have known these facts for years. Have they done a very good job of informing women about how the Pill really works? (Please email us and let us know if you were aware of how the Pill worked before you read this.)</p>
<p>When chemists devised the Pill that debuted in 1960, they gave it a huge dose of a chemical that caused most women's ovaries to stop secreting eggs (i.e., to stop ovulation). The theory was "no egg, no pregnancy."</p>
<p>However, some women continued to release eggs and get pregnant while on the original Pill. (Studies have shown that an even higher percentage of women release eggs while using today's newer, re-formulated Pills. More about today's Pills in a moment.)</p>
<p>In her award winning study of women taking the earlier high dose Pills, Dutch gynecologist Dr. Nine Van der Vange showed "proof of ovulation based on ultrasound exams and hormonal indicators occurred in about 4.7% of the cycles studied." (Source: Sterns, Dr. David, "How the Pill and the IUD Work: Gambling with Life," American Life League, PO Box 1350, Stafford, VA 22555)</p>
<p>And the "Textbook of Contraceptive Practice" states that, "Among women who have been followed over a considerable number of cycles, breakthrough ovulations occur in 2 to 10 percent of cycles." (Source: Dr. J. Peel &amp; Dr. Malcolm Potts, Textbook of Contraceptive Practice, 1969, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press)</p>
<p>Please note that these references are to the lower breakthrough ovulation rates of the Pills of the 1960's. The new Pills of the 1990's work differently and have much higher breakthrough ovulation rates. This will be explained as you read on.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong><img height="82" alt="" width="123" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/Images1111.jpg" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why the big secret?</strong></p>
<p>Why aren't most women aware that the Pill causes early abortions? Let's look at the large pharmaceutical companies who advertise, market and sell the Pill. They make huge profits from the Pill -- and they'll continue to make mega-profits -- if women are convinced they're not getting pregnant and they keep buying and taking the Pill everyday. But are they being honest with you? Have they clearly explained that their products cause millions of early chemical abortions each year?</p>
<p><strong>The New Pills: Much Higher Rates of Breakthrough Ovulation . . .</strong></p>
<p>The original Pill of the 1960's had to be modified due to harmful side effects that women were experiencing because of the powerful chemicals. All versions of today's "Combination Pill" have a reduced hormonal content. When compared to the Pills of the 1960's and 1970's, this reduces the chance of harmful side effects for women, but it also increases their chances of ovulating and conceiving a son or daughter.</p>
<p>Dr. Ronald Chez, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), publicly stated that the new Pills of today, with their lower estrogen dose, allow ovulation up to 50% of the time! (Source: Sterns, David, M.D., Sterns, Gina, R.N., B.S.N., Yaksich, Pamela, "Gambling with Life, How the I.U.D. and 'The Pill' Work" (www.top.net/vitalsigns).</p>
<p>With these newer Pills, simply missing one tablet, or failing to take the Pill at the same time each day increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation. Reactions with other drugs increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation, especially with caffeine and nicotine, or some prescription medicine (Source: "Abortifacient Contraception: The Pharmaceutical Holocaust" by Dr. Rudolf Ehmann, Human Life Intl., 1993, p.15).</p>
<p>Makers of the new "mini-pill" claim it does not have the side effects of the combination pill. However, they don't tell you that scientific research shows the mini-pill does not stop ovulation at all in 67-81% of the women who use it, so the probability of conception is much higher. (Source: Tonti-Fillippini, Nicholas, Linacre Quarterly, 1995)</p>

<p><strong>Breakthrough Ovulation Estimates for other "Birth Control" Methods:</strong></p>
<p>1) Norplant has breakthrough ovulation 50-65% of the time.</p>
<p>2) Depo-Provera has breakthrough ovulation 40-60% of the time.</p>
<p>3) The IUD has breakthrough ovulation 100% of the time.</p>
<p>4) With over 17 million American women using the Pill and other chemical abortifacients, it is estimated that breakthough ovulation and pregnany occurs so often . . . that between 7 to 12 million newly conceived children are killed by chemical abortions in the womb each year. And most of these women never even knew they were pregnant.</p>
<p>(Sources for the four points listed under Breakthrough Ovulation Estimates above are as follows: 1) Hilgers, Dr. Thomas, "Norplant" Linacre Quarterly, 1993, p.64-69. 2) "Infant Homicides Through Contraceptives," 1994 by the Study of Abortion Deaths Ad Hoc Commission - Bardstown, KY.

<p><strong>Betrayed!</strong></p>
<p>If you are taking these products to avoid pregnancy (and abortion), now you know that the makers and promoters of "birth control" products have betrayed you and your children. It has been proven many times that these products do not completely stop ovulation and conception. In fact, depending upon the product you're using, you could be at risk of ending the life of a newly conceived son or daughter every month by birth control's chemical abortions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>More Proof . . .</strong></p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration stated in 1978 that:</p>
<p>Combination oral contraceptives . . . [make] alterations in the genital tract including changes in the . . . endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation) . . . but progestogen only contraceptives [re: mini-pills] are known to alter the cervical mucus, exert a progestational effect on the endometrium, interfering with implantation. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Medical Publications confirm the facts . . .</strong></p>
<p>"The Physicians' Desk Reference" quoted a Searle brochure (Searle is a major pharmaceutical manufacturer of the Pill) which states that the mini-pill: makes the womb (uterus) less receptive to any fertilized egg that reaches it. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>"Nursing '85 Drug Handbook" states: Progestogen...also caused endometrial changes that prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>"The Pill - How Does It Work?" By Albert D. Lorincz, M.D.: Cites a study of 1,200 women given a daily amount of progestogen equivalent to many birth control pills. 60% of them ovulated.</p>
<p>"Birth Control: Why Are They Lying to Women?" By J.C. Espinoza, M.D. (page 27) cites research which showed a 30% ovulation rate in women taking a combined Pill preparation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>From Birth Control Advocates</strong></p>
<p>Lawyers from organizations that promote abortion have admitted in print and in legal briefs that these products cause abortions. A Tulane Law School Professor wrote:</p>
<p>...nearly all birth control devices, except the diaphragm and the condom, operate between the time of conception and implantation... (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>Attorney Frank Sussman argued in the U.S. Supreme Court: ...IUDs [and] low dose birth control pills...act as abortifacients.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>The Big Lie</strong></p>
<p>Propoganda from many pharmaceutical companies promotes a new definition of CONCEPTION. Their new definition is absolutely untruthful and totally unscientific. They created this new definition of when a child is conceived to help them sell their products with the label "contraceptives." Their new definition says that conception occurs only when your baby successfully attaches to the lining of your uterus. THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>The real medical truth.</strong></p>
<p>It's very important to understand that when a sperm penetrates one of your eggs, you have conceived a child. Again, this is called fertilization or conception and from that point on, you have a brand new, genetically complete son or daughter.</p>
<p>Every conception is a very unique moment. For example, at your own conception, 46 chromosomes with 30,000 genes combined to determine all your physical characteristics; sex, facial features, body type, color of hair, eyes and skin. Even more amazing, intelligence and personality -- the way you think and feel -- were already in place within your genetic code. At the moment of conception, you were essentially and uniquely "you." This is the same for every human being at the moment of conception.</p>
<p>Remember, the pharmaceutical industry has a multi-billion dollar business selling these abortifacients. Unfortunately, many of the people who prescribe these products are not aware of their homicidal properties. They may have a sincere desire to help women, but their lack of knowledge makes them uninformed accomplices to these early abortions.</p>
<p>As recent as 25 years ago, most doctors took the Hippocratic Oath. They pledged never to perform an abortion. Tragically, many working in the medical profession today betray your trust by renouncing this ethic. Many know the truth but do not inform you that "birth control" devices are abortifacients which cause abortions.</p>
<p>Did you know abortion was defined in a Public Health Service document published by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare as follows:</p>
<p>"All the measures which impair the viability of the zygote anytime between the instant of fertilization and the completion of labor constitute, in the strict sense, procedures for inducing abortion" (source: Public Health Service Leaflet no. 1066, US Dept of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1963, 27). This includes chemical abortions like those caused by the Pill, Depo-Provera and Norplant.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Now That You Know The Truth . . .</strong></p>
<p>If you have used these products, this is very sobering news. Pharmaceutical companies and medical providers have made many parents unwitting accomplices to their own children's death by birth control abortion.</p>
<p>The Pill and its "cousins" kill children earlier in their life than surgical abortion. In America, chemical abortions are estimated to kill more than 7 million babies each year -- while surgical abortions kill about 1.5 million babies each year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p>
<p>Scientists agree that a new human life begins at the moment of conception. If you believe this, then you know that abortion is wrong no matter how early in the pregnancy.</p>
<p>Now that you know the facts, statistics show that if you continue using abortifacient products, you will be aborting (killing) your own children each year. Do more research if you need to, but please stop using abortifacient chemicals immediately. (If you want to investigate further, another web site that contains more research and much greater detail is listed at the end of this article. It is highly recommended that you go to that web site today or sometime soon.)</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Healing &amp; Forgiveness!</strong></p>
<p>If you have used these products -- there is a very real possibility that you unknowingly aborted one or more of your tiny sons or daughters. Please do not despair! Know that you may receive comfort in your sorrow. If you did not know these "birth control" products cause early abortions, then you are not "culpable." This means you're not morally responsible in God's eyes. And because you did not know the true consequences of chemical "birth control" products, you will not be held morally responsible for any harm they may have caused.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, for anyone to commit a sinful act, all three of the following circumstances must be present:</strong></p>
<p>1) The act must break one of God's Laws,</p>
<p>2) The person must know they are breaking God's Law, and</p>
<p>3) The person must freely choose to break God's Law with their own</p>
<p>free will.</p>
<p>Again, if you've used "birth control" pills and you were unaware of the consequences, God will not hold you morally accountable. Our God is a merciful, loving Father. He will only judge us based on our knowledge of right and wrong. And when we do wrong, He's always ready to forgive us -- no matter how serious the sin.</p>
<p>At the same time, He has given us guidelines to protect us and to help us be happy. And now that you know the truth about "birth control" pills -- if you're using them -- isn't it time to stop?</p>
<p>God calls on each of us to avoid and eliminate all sin from our lives. Please think about the day in the future when you will meet your Maker face to face. On that day, if you continue using chemical abortifacients after you read this information, He will ask you, "Why?"</p>
<p>Why not stop today? Why not purify your soul by receiving God's healing Grace? God will forgive us for our past sins, no matter how serious they are, but only if we sincerely ask for His forgiveness with a humble, repentant heart, while also being firmly resolved not to commit the sin again.</p>
<p>Our God is merciful, forgiving and gracious to all who repent. No problem is so great that the God who created us cannot solve it.</p>
<p>Saint Paul wrote about God's great mercy for sinners in a letter to Timothy. He said, "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners -- of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on Him and receive eternal life." (1st Timothy, 1:15-16)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Final Notes . . .</strong></p>
<p>It is important that you seek spiritual direction from your priest or pastor regarding decisions about your family and the dreadful effects of artificial contraception. Please feel free to print a copy of this article to bring with you when you go to meet with your pastor. Ask him if he understands the destructive and sinful nature of the Pill and other forms of artificial contraception. And please remember, if you are a Catholic, the Catholic Church offers God's mercy and forgiveness in a beautiful way through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession). If you've committed a serious sin, you should go to confession right away. Priests are very understanding and they are there to help you. Confession is a great place to begin the process of forgiveness and healing. Go ahead and go today -- you'll feel like a ton of bricks was lifted off your shoulders.</p>

<p><strong>Natural Family Planning . . .</strong></p>
<p><br />
<img height="125" alt="" width="125" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/3881920941.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />
Natural Family Planning (NFP) is a healthy alternative to artificial birth control. With NFP, there are no drugs, no devices, no surgical procedures, no threat of death, no side effects and no chemical abortions. NFP is not the old Rhythm Method that was developed in the 1930's. NFP has been thoroughly tested and is proven to be highly effective. NFP is only recommended for married couples who have some burden (financial, emotional, health or other) causing them to need to space or limit the size of their family. It is suggested that you speak with your pastor or a spiritual director for spiritual guidance in this area.</p>
<p>Reports show NFP to be about 99% effective in determining when a woman is at the stage where she will conceive. This can help with trying to get pregnant as well as trying to avoid pregnancy.</p>
<p>"Using NFP has been a blessing! We have found a greater appreciation for being able to make love. We also are learning other ways to express our love . . ." -- E.M., Ohio</p>
<p>". . . Wonderful for our marriage. We are comfortable using it . . ." -- L.L., Iowa</p>
<p>"My husband is not only my partner in life, he is my best friend. NFP has forced us to take time out to work on our friendship." -- K.S., Pennsylvania</p>
<p>"There is a season for everything, a time for every occupation under heaven . . . a time for embracing, a time to refrain from embracing." -- Ecclesiastes 3:1,5</p>
<p>To find out more about NFP, call The Couple to Couple League International and ask for their FREE brochures on NFP. The Couple to Couple League phone number is (513) 471-2000 and their web site is at: www.ccli.org for more information.</p>

<strong>Pro-Life Spokesperson Objects To FDA Action On Morning-After Pill</strong> Main Category: Women's Health / OBGYN News Article Date: 01 Aug 2006 - 0:00 PDT Article Also Appears In FertilitySexual Health / STDs</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><br />
Deirdre McQuade, pro-life spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, reacted strongly to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcement on July 31 moving toward over-the- counter (OTC) availability of Plan B for women eighteen and older.</p>
<p>"Making this powerful, abortifacient drug available without a doctor's oversight could place women and their newly-conceived children at risk," Ms. McQuade said.</p>
<p><strong>Plan B -- also known as the "morning-after pill" -- is essentially a megadose of prescription hormonal birth-control pills. "Plan B is marketed as a contraceptive but even its proponents admit that it works both before and after conception," Ms. McQuade said.</strong></p>
<p>"Over-the-counter availability would allow these drugs to be used routinely, despite the fact that they are not approved for such use. Studies presented to the FDA confirm that many women do not understand that the pills should not be used routinely," McQuade said. "Many are also unaware of their abortifacient action."</p>
<p>"Women for whom the drug is dangerous would not have the benefit of any clinical advice to alert them to the risks," McQuade said. One physician who supports OTC availability of Plan B concedes that "repeated use of [emergency contraception] wreaks havoc on a woman's cycle" with "resulting menstrual chaos."</p>
<p>"It would also place additional pressure on pharmacists who conscientiously object to dispensing drugs that can kill humans at their earliest stages of development," Ms. McQuade continued.</p>
<p>"As surprising as it may seem to proponents of Plan B, a 2005 study co- authored by a Planned Parenthood doctor in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that having Plan B on hand did nothing to reduce pregnancy rates compared to those who obtained the drug from a pharmacy," McQuade noted.</p>

<p>The Pill: Addressing the Scientific and Ethical Questions of the Abortifacient Issue</p>
<p>Edited by Linda K .Bevington, M.A. &amp; Russell DiSilvestro, M.A. Ph.D. (cand.)</p>
<p>This resource consists of a collection of articles addressing the complex question of whether the birth control pill sometimes act to cause the death of an early embryo. This question has caused some couples, physicians, and pastors to cease use, prescription, and/or advocacy of the pill, while others remain unconvinced of its alleged abortifacient effect.</p>
<p>Authored by physicians and other professionals, the packet's numerous articles outline the scientific evidence (or lack thereof) being pointed to in support of each position. The myriad of ethical questions raised by this issue are also reflected upon by those on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p>The packet's introduction goes beyond the abortifacient question, encouraging the reader to engage in thoughtful reflection on such matters as the use of contraception in general, God's design for marriage and the family, the purposes of sexuality, and the impact of the decision concerning pill use on the woman's lifestyle and health.</p>
<p>Also featured are FAQ's, position statements of major Christian organizations, and an annotated bibliography.</p>

This two-page summary was researched by Focus on the Family's Physicians Resource Council (24 members) and reflects Dr. Dobson's opinion regarding hormonal birth control. It says, in part, "The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs on the pill, that there is enough of a possibility for an abortifacient effect...to warrant informing women about it."

<p>This article reviews Randy Alcorn's booklet, "Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?" (Reference #3) The author asserts that the available evidence does not demonstrate that the pill acts by abortifacient mechanisms and concludes with the following statement about informed consent: "Perhaps we should tell our patients about this controversy. But what exactly do we tell them? Is there a high risk or low risk of causing abortion? I tell them that there is an unknown risk but that risk can be reduced to a tolerable level through responsible pill taking." Several later issues of Ethics and Medicine contained long responses which claimed Goodnough's analysis was lacking - references #8, 22 and 28.

<p>This systematic review evaluated the available evidence for the postfertilization effects of the birth control pill and concluded, "...good evidence exists to support the hypothesis that the effectiveness of the pill depends to some degree on postfertilization effects." However, the review also concluded, "...there are insufficient data to quantitate the relative contribution of postfertilization effects" Nevertheless, the authors suggest, "...the principles of informed consent suggest that patients who may object to any postfertilization loss should be made aware of this information so that they can give fully informed consent for the use of the pill." <a class="external free" title="http://archfami.ama-assn.org/issues/v9n2/ffull/fsa8035.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://archfami.ama-assn.org/issues/v9n2/ffull/fsa8035.html">http://archfami.ama-assn.org/issues/v9n2/ffull/fsa8035.html</a> (available online only for AMA members) Sherfey MA.

Priests for Life Announces Year-Long Preparation for 40th Anniversary of Humanae Vitae</p>
<p>July 25, 2008 will be the 40th anniversary of Pope Paul VIâs encyclical letter Humanae Vitae. Beginning on July 25 of 2007, Priests for Life will call attention to this special anniversary, and to the wisdom and insight of this important document. Respect for human life is the basis of civilization, and respect for life demands respect for the sources of life. We invite you to visit this page frequently during the year for updates and practical resources.</p>
<p>There is a close link between abortion and contraception. Natural Family Planning, furthermore, provides a solution to both. The Encyclical Humanae Vitae has been and will remain a prophetic voice in the Church bearing witness to these truths. Pope John Paul II's Evangelium Vitae likewise explains the connection between abortion and contraception as "fruits of the same tree."</p>
<p>In their 2001 revision of the Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities ("A Campaign in Support of Life"), the United States Catholic Bishops speak of the connection between abortion and contraception in the following paragraphs:</p>
<p><strong><a class="new" title="Abortion and Contraception" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion_and_Contraception&amp;action=edit">Abortion and Contraception</a></strong></p>
<p>The Church's teaching and pastoral efforts on responsible parenthood are appropriately treated more fully in other documents. However, we address the issue here, because some promote widespread use of contraception as a means to reduce abortions and even criticize the Church for not accepting this approach.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that as acceptance and use of contraception have increased in our society, so have acceptance and use of abortion. Couples who unintentionally conceive a child while using contraception are far more likely to resort to abortion than others. Tragically, our society has fallen into a mentality that views children as a burden and invites many to consider abortion as a "backup" to contraceptive failure. This is most obvious in efforts to promote as "emergency contraception" drugs that really act as early abortifacients.</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
With Pope John Paul II we affirm that contraception and abortion are "specifically different evils," because only "the latter destroys the life of a human being," but that they are also related (The Gospel of Life, no. 13). It is important to remember that means that are referred to as "contraceptive" are, in reality, sometimes also abortifacient. An end to abortion will not come from contraceptive campaigns but from a deeper understanding of our human sexuality, and of human life, as sacred gifts deserving our careful stewardship.</p>

Priests for Life is committed to assisting the clergy to proclaim these realities. We will provide an increasing amount of educational material on this page, as well as links to other web sites.</p>

While using a condom, you can still become pregnant. Condoms have an annual contraceptive failure rate of 18.4 percent for girls under age 18. (1) And among young, unmarried, minority women the annual failure rate is 36.3 percent; among unmarried Hispanic women it is as high as 44.5 percent.(2)</p>
<p>1)âContraceptive Failure Rate in the U.S.: Estimates From the 1982 Natl. Survey of Family Growth,â M.D. Hayward and J. Yogi, Family Planning Perspectives, Sept/Oct. 1986, p. 204</p>

<p><strong>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Condoms provide even less protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than they do against pregnancy.</p>
<p>Thatâs because a woman can get pregnant only at ovulation time (two to three days each month), but a sexually transmitted disease can pass from partner to partner at any time of the month.</p>
<p>Venereal diseases frequently spread through âskin to skinâ contact even when condoms are used. This can happen because the bacterial or viral germs that cause many serious STDs (such as human papilloma virus, chlamydia, herpes and syphilis) do not infect just one place on your body. They may infect anywhere in the male or female genital areas. So even if the virus or bacteria doesnât get through the condom itself, you can still get a disease, because condoms donât cover all areas necessary to prevent infection during sexual contact.</p>
<p><strong>Health Experts Say. . .</strong></p>
<p>Many leading health experts warn that you should not depend on condoms for protection against AIDS and other STDs:</p>
<p>âSimply put, condoms fail. And condoms fail at a rate unacceptable for me as a physician to endorse them as a strategy to be promoted as meaningful AIDS protection.â â Dr. Robert Renfield, chief of retro-viral research, Walter Reed Army Institute</p>
<p>Source: âCondom âCureâ Questioned by Top AIDS Researcher,â Russell Shaw,Our Sunday Visitor,1/23/94</p>
<p>âSaying that the use of condoms is âsafe sexâ is in fact playing Russian roulette. A lot of people will die in this dangerous game.â â Dr. Teresa Crenshaw, member of the U.S. Presidential AIDS Commission and past president of the American Association of Sex Educators</p>
<p>Source: âCondoms: Experts Fear False Sense of Security,â The New York Times, 8/18/87.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Are Condoms Really Safe?</strong></p>
<p>Fact: Latex condoms have tiny intrinsic holes called âvoids.â The AIDS virus is 50 times smaller than these tiny holes which makes it easy for the virus to pass through them, (1) about as easy as a dime passing through a basketball hoop.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Telling somebody to put a mere balloon between their health and a deadly disease is irresponsible. Itâs like telling someone itâs okay to drink and drive as long as they wear a seat belt.</p>

<p><strong><a class="new" title="People &amp; Events: The Catholic Church and Birth Control" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_%26_Events:_The_Catholic_Church_and_Birth_Control&amp;action=edit"><font size="5">&#160;The Catholic Church and Birth Control</font></a></strong></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Until the 1930s, the Catholic Church was not alone in its opposition to contraceptives. In the Christian tradition, birth control had long been associated with promiscuity and adultery, and resolutely condemned. However, after the Anglican Church passed a resolution in favor of birth control at its 1930 Lambeth Conference, other Protestant denominations began to relax their prohibitions as well. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church held fast to its opposition.</p>
<p>The Vatican's stand against contraception was centuries old. For much of that time, however, birth control had remained a dormant issue. Since most birth control consisted of folk remedies and homemade cervical caps, there was little cause for the Church to respond. It was the mass production and availability of rubber condoms and diaphragms in the 1920s and 1930s, made possible by the 1839 invention of vulcanized rubber, which eventually forced the Church to take a public position on specific contraceptives.</p>
<p><font size="4">A Mortal Sin</font></p>
<p>On New Year's Eve 1930, the Roman Catholic Church officially banned any "artificial" means of birth control. Condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps were defined as artificial, since they blocked the natural journey of sperm during intercourse. Douches, suppositories and spermicides all killed or impeded sperm, and were banned as well. According to Church doctrine, tampering with the "male seed" was tantamount to murder. A common admonition on the subject at the time was "so many conceptions prevented, so many homicides." To interfere with God's will was a mortal sin and grounds for excommunication.</p>
<p><font size="4">The Purpose of Intercourse</font></p>
<p>For the Vatican, the primary purpose of intercourse was for the sacred act of procreation. If couples were interested in having intercourse, then they had to be willing to accept the potential for the creation of another life. For devout Catholics, that left only abstinence or the church-approved rhythm method (the practice of abstaining from sex during the woman's period of ovulation). However, the rhythm method was unreliable, and many believed it placed a heavy strain on marital relations.</p>
<p><font size="4">A Reformist Climate</font></p>
<p>With the arrival of the birth control pill in 1960, many believed the Church was about to change the position it had held for centuries. The Church was in the midst of reform, and in this climate of modernization it seemed possible that the Vatican might bend on birth control. Since 1957, Church law had allowed women with "irregular" cycles to take the Pill to regularize their cycle and enable them to better practice the rhythm method. Approval of the contraceptive pill, many believed, was soon to follow.</p>
<p><font size="4">"Natural" Contraception</font></p>
<p>Pro-Pill Catholics had a powerful ally on their side. John Rock, the eminent Catholic physician who had carried out Pill trials with Dr. Gregory Pincus, publicly argued that the Pill was merely an extension of the body's normal functioning. Since the Pill used the same hormones already present in the female reproductive system and did not tamper with sperm, Rock believed the Church should view the Pill as a "natural" form of contraception.</p>
<p>The Vatican convened a commission to study the question of the Pill, but the Church would take eight years to determine its policy towards the Pill. In the interim, the Pill quickly became the most popular method of birth control among American women -- regardless of religion.</p>

<p><font color="#327d9a" size="4">Q.</font> <strong>Does the birth control pill increase your risk of breast cancer?</strong><br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 18px; color: #327d9a">A.</font> Since I am not a physician, in order to answer this question, I can only refer you to those who are:</p>
<li>In a July 29th 2005 press release, the World Health Organization openly admitted that cobined estrogen-progestogen Oral Contraceptives are carcinogenic to humans. Specifically, they said that âUse of OCâs increases risk of breast, cervix, and liver cancer.â The data was presented by a working group of 21 scientists from 8 countries convened by the cancer research agency of the WHO, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The press release can be read <a target="_new" href="http://www.iarc.fr/ENG/Press_Releases/pr167a.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>The <em>Physicianâs Desk Reference</em> (PDR) is a 3500 page book used by doctors that explains how drugs work. In it is the âexact copy of the productâs FDA-approved or other manufacturer-supplied labeling.â The 2006 PDR states that âa meta-analysis of 54 studies found a small increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives or had used them within the past ten years.â Upon reading this, I tracked down the original source. It was an article from the Lancet, which gathered data from over 150,000 women. It said, âThe studies included in this collaboration represent about 90% of the epidemiological information on the topic, and what is known about the other studies suggests that their omission has not materially affected the main conclusions.â Some might argue that the increase in breast cancer risk is only a small one. But with 80-100 million women on the pill across the globe, the numbers certainly add up.</li>
<li>Most recently, in October 2006, the journal of the Mayo Clinic (<em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em>) published an article entitled <a target="_new" href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf/8110/8110a1.pdf">âOral Contraceptive Use as a Risk Factor for Pre-menopausal Breast Cancer: A Meta-analysis,â</a> authored by Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., et al. It revealed that 21 of 23 studies that followed women who took the pill prior to having their first child showed an increased risk of breast cancer. The increase was especially steep among younger women. Dr. Kahlenborn told WebMD, "Anyone who is prescribing oral contraceptives has a duty to tell women that 21 of 23 studies showed an increased risk." He added elsewhere that, âAs more information comes out, itâs going to be increasingly difficult to suppress [the documented evidence from medical studies]. Thereâs a growing sense that itâs really just a matter of time before the lid blows on this thing. I think by the year 2010, we will start seeing a new attitude towards the pill, and it will be fueled by lawsuits.â</li>
<li>In the <em>Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs </em>it is stated that "Early-age use of the pill carries a greater risk of breast cancer, of developing larger tumors and having a worse prognosis"(2). The Pill can cause plenty of other problems as well, but click <a href="http://www.pureloveclub.net/chastity/index.php?id=7&amp;entryid=124">here </a>for details on that. <br />
<br />
Many doctors do not believe there is a link between the Pill and breast cancer. But considering that the World Heath Organization, the 2006 <em>Physicianâs Desk Reference</em>, the journal of the Mayo Clinic, and other reliable sources openly admit such a connection, I believe there is reason for concern. Should a woman be prescribed the pill for medical reasons (as my wife was, with Endometriosis and ovarian tumors), she will be glad to know that successful alternatives exist. Click <a target="_new" href="http://www.pureloveclub.com/chastity/index.php?id=7&amp;entryid=55">here </a>for details on that.<br />
<br />
You might wonder why the Pill would increase one's odds of developing breast cancer. Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., explains: "Two of the most important types of hormones that control reproduction are estrogens and progestins. Birth Control Pills are made from synthetic estrogens and/or progestins. Experiments have shown that these hormones cause women's breast cells to divide more rapidly, which makes them more easily affected by carcinogens - agents which cause cancer"(3). <br />
<br />
To read more on breast cancer and the Pill, I'd recommend reading Dr. Kahlenborn's book, <em>Breast Cancer: Its Link to Abortion and the Birth Control Pill</em>. Also check out <em>A Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs</em> by John B.Wilks, Pharm. M.P.S. <br />

<p>February 9, 2008</p>
<p>How can something be both immense and minute at the same time, something upon which all of human history depends, yet fragile and almost non-existent to the eye?&#160; It is the union of an egg and sperm â an embryo.&#160; Such is God's way.&#160; He takes something smaller than a mustard seed and brings forth all of civilization. &#160;After creating everything in the universe single-handedly, He created us in his own image and bestowed upon us the power to become co-creators with Him. &#160;Working in union with us, when the sperm unites with the egg, not only has a new human life been set in motion, but so too has a spiritual life.&#160; God places an everlasting soul into the being of every son and daughter.</p>
<p>Most of us rarely think that deeply about it all. &#160;In our worldly way, we forget eternity and begin to affix costs â physical, emotional and monetary.&#160; The costs can seem exorbitant when we focus only through the eyes of the world. &#160;And looking through those same worldly eyes, the way to prevent the miracle we clearly do not recognize as such is so easy, inexpensive, and ironically, also so small â the birth control pill.&#160; But the pill does not just prevent the miracle, it also destroys it,&#160;a fact that is often surprising to committed pro-lifers.&#160; This fact is true for all contraception that works through manipulation of hormone levels.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>The pill has become a symbol of freedom to those who have been told they can "have it all".&#160; And it has become a symbol of destruction to those who support a "Theology of the Body," philosophy, the essence of Catholic teaching that artificial means must not disrupt God's natural order of things.</p>
<p>The first birth control pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 1960.&#160; Using a synthetic estrogen hormone, the pill tricked a women's body into thinking it was pregnant.&#160; No egg would be released thereby preventing the opportunity for conception.&#160;</p>
<p>Although the pill was initially introduced with the idea of affording women a reliable way of limiting their family size, it soon became the ticket to the Sexual Revolution that began in the Sixties and never really ended.&#160; The pill promised something it's never been able to deliver: sex with "no strings attached". &#160;There are always emotional and moral consequences to thwarting God's purpose, but women discovered physical problems too. &#160;Blood clots, heart attacks and strokes were some of the side effects caused by the Pill's high estrogen levels.&#160; Drug manufacturers lowered these levels in order to reduce the side effects but that also increased the incidence of breakthrough ovulation.&#160; With the lower levels of estrogen, eggs would sometimes still get released and pregnancies resulted.&#160;</p>
<p><img height="200" alt=" " width="300" align="left" src="http://www.catholicexchange.com/files/u30/020908_lead_today.jpg" />The drug companies tackled this situation by adding the synthetic hormone progesterone, which makes the uterine wall (the endometrium) inhospitable to implantation by an embryo. &#160;So if an egg was released and became fertilized by a sperm, thus creating life, the pill would have actually failed to prevent a conception, meaning it failed as a contraceptive.&#160; But, through preventing implantation of the embryo, the pill acts as an abortifacient and stops life from continuing to the next stage.&#160; (A clear and simple demonstration of this can be seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiCU46_lWeE">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Since some women actually do become pregnant while on the pill, there are some embryos that manage to implant into the uterus. &#160;Whether it's RU-486, Norplant, Depo-Provera, the morning after pill, the Mini-pill, or the Pill, there is no chemical "contraceptive" that&#160;<em>always </em>causes an abortion.&#160; There is also none that <em>never</em> causes an abortion<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ignorance</strong></p>
<p>There is no way of knowing what percentage of pregnancies result in abortion through the pill.&#160; The woman using the pill with this scenario never even knows that she conceived a child.&#160; Her cycle will continue on schedule with no realization that an embryo is being flushed from her body.&#160; The Catholic Church has never wavered on the teaching that life begins at conception.&#160; Although Catholics are contracepting at rates parallel to non-Catholics, using artificial means to change our body's natural functions in order to block the potential for life has been recognized as rebellion against God's plan for humanity.&#160; However, using natural means to understand the rhythms of life and then to work in union with God is encouraged through Natural Family Planning.</p>
<p>The issue of birth control is a big one where misunderstanding and ignorance often misguide people.&#160; But when it comes to the pill, the ignorance that many women fall prey to is lack of understanding of its abortifacient properties.&#160; Most women don't consider that while taking their birth control, they may also be aborting a life within them.&#160; As Pope Paul VI predicted when he issued his encyclical <em>Humanae Vitae</em> (<em>Of Human Life</em>) in 1968, the use of artificial contraception would lead to abortions.</p>
<p>Although it seemed to many to be an overdramatic prediction, it proved to be prophetic.&#160; In hindsight, its logic in saying that widespread use of contraception would lead to "conjugal infidelity and the general lowering of morality"&#160;was prophetic. &#160;Since the Pill began to be sold in 1960, divorces have tripled, out-of-wedlock births jumped from 224,000 to 1.2 million, abortions doubled, and cohabitation soared 10-fold from 430,000 to 4.2 million.</p>
<p>Sex both inside and outside marriage ceased to be about a bond of marital love in which a couple became one in union with God.&#160; It became merely an activity for personal satisfaction devoid of anything more.&#160; The Pope predicted man would lose respect for woman, considering her "as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment, and no longer as his respected and beloved companion."</p>
<p>Society as a whole moved from recognizing sex as something reserved for married couples to something for everyone, since the possibility for pregnancy was greatly reduced (although never completely removed).&#160; Thus, people completely opposed to having children could have sex with others whom they had chosen as bed partners but would never chose to co-parent their children.&#160; The most intimate experience intended to be shared in love and self-giving with the potential for creating life became merely a form of recreation.&#160; And if life sprang forth, such a life was easily regarded as nothing more than an unintended problem that could legally be disposed of through abortion.</p>
<p>But women choosing abortion and the men who either make that choice with them or plead for them to do otherwise, are very aware of the decision that is being made, whereas women who choose to take birth control pills are not so aware of the potential ramifications of their choice.&#160; There is not a baby with a heartbeat who must forcefully be removed, but unbeknownst to many, there <em>is</em> a baby.&#160; Since life begins at conception, a life, even though undetectable to us, is still a life.&#160; It is the way God chooses to begin things, small and yet mighty in its eternal existence.&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to the pill, IUDs, Depo-Provera and Norplant also cause early, undetectable abortions.&#160;&#160;Doctor usually fail to warn women of the abortifacient properties of the pill.&#160; I've heard some doctors admit they were not actually even aware of these properties.&#160;&#160;Women often choose contraception as a means to avoid pregnancy without realizing they are not actually stopping pregnancy, but quickly ending it.</p>
<p><strong>Denial</strong></p>
<p>In his booklet, titled <em>Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?</em>, Randy Alcorn states: "The question of whether it causes abortions has direct bearing on untold millions of Christians, many of them pro-life, who use and recommend it. &#160;For those who believe God is the Creator of each person and the giver and taker of human life, this is a question with profound moral implications."</p>
<p>Alcorn was a Protestant pastor who not only used the pill in his married life, but also counseled other married couples to do so.&#160; He had a vested interest in <em>not</em> recognizing the pill as an abortifactient.&#160; But when confronted with the facts through his own research, it demanded changes in his own behavior and philosophy.&#160; His <a href="http://www.epm.org/articles/bcp5400.html#_edn31">booklet</a> was written in 1998 to inform others of the truth.</p>
<p>Alcorn's booklet has met some opposition.&#160; According to him: "Despite evidence, some pro-life physicians state that the likelihood of the Pill having an abortifacient effect is infinitesimally low, or nonexistent. <a href="http://www.epm.org/articles/bcp5400.html#_edn31">&#160;</a>Though I would very much like to believe this, the scientific evidence does not permit me to do so."</p>
<p>Alcorn, surprisingly, found that the greatest resistance to recognizing the abortifacient quality of the pill comes from the Christian community.&#160; "Dr. Walt Larimore has told me that whenever he has presented this evidence to audiences of secular physicians, there has been little or no resistance to it.&#160; But when he has presented it to Christian physicians there has been substantial resistance. &#160;Since secular physicians do not care whether the Pill prevents implantation, they tend to be objective in interpreting the evidence. &#160;After all, they have little or nothing at stake either way.&#160; Christian physicians, however, very much do not want to believe the Pill causes early abortions. &#160;Therefore, I believe, they tend to resist the evidence. &#160;This is certainly understandable. &#160;Nonetheless, we should not permit what we<em> want </em>to believe to distract us from what the evidence indicates we <em>should</em> believe."&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>It's easier to be pro-life when we limit the discussion to the abortion industry.&#160; The inclusion of artificial birth control complicates and confuses people.&#160; With so many opinions even among Catholics, how is a person to know what to believe?&#160; I understand the confusion.&#160; While living in Montana, I had a doctor who was also a priest, who told me it was not realistic to expect a couple to follow the Catholic teaching on birth control.&#160; He prescribed birth control pills to many of his female patients.&#160; So, is it any surprise there are many Catholics, ones like me, ignorant of the true teaching?</p>
<p>Yet, we must cut through the false teachings and erroneous opinions to reach the truth.&#160; Our lives, our bodies and our souls are all we have.&#160; They are gifts that must be safeguarded. <a href="http://www.christopherwest.com/">Christopher West</a>, author and speaker,&#160;has written books and articles explaining the beauty and truth of God's plan for men and women. &#160;In his book, <em>Good News about Sex and Marriage</em>, he asserts that the Church's teaching on sex and marriage is good news because it's the truth about love and true love is the fulfillment of the human person. &#160;He also admits that the news is challenging.&#160; "This is so because the truth about love is always challenging."</p>

<br />
<font size="2">CHERRY HILL, N.J. (CNS) -- Mark W. LeChevallier agrees with Dr. Lester Ruppersberger, a pro-life obstetrician and gynecologist, that natural family planning is safe, healthy and effective. But he would add one more characteristic: It's environmentally responsible.<br />
<br />
LeChevallier is director of innovation and environmental stewardship at American Water, the largest water and wastewater provider in North America. Along with his wife, he also has been a certified instructor of natural family planning for the past 25 years.<br />
<br />
In separate talks July 26 to a national conference in Cherry Hill, LeChevallier and Ruppersberger approached the topic of natural family planning from very different directions but reached similarly positive conclusions.<br />
<br />
The July 25-27 conference brought together leaders from diocesan pro-life, family life and social justice offices around the country.<br />
<br />
Ruppersberger's talk on "Scientific Advances in Fertility Management" touted the benefits he has seen for his patients and himself since he switched to an NFP-only medical practice in 1999.<br />
<br />
LeChevallier shared the podium with Roxana U. Barillas, a domestic policy adviser at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, for a discussion on "Toxins, the Environment and the Child in the Womb." He spoke about the drastic effects that discarded contraceptive medicines and devices have been having on the nation's water and animals, especially fish.<br />
<br />
In a talk with the daunting title of "Endocrine Disruptions: Chemical Contraceptives in Sewage Effluents," LeChevallier explained that like secondhand smoke, "secondhand estrogens are being released into the environment," to devastating effect on fish, panthers, alligators and other wildlife.<br />
<br />
He said the media "did a little bit of a disservice" to the American public when they reported earlier this year that the levels of contaminants found in drinking water could seriously harm humans.<br />
<br />
For example, "you would have to drink 100 million gallons to get the dose found in one Tylenol," he said.<br />
<br />
But "the synthetic estrogen used in birth control pills can wreak havoc on the sex lives of fish," LeChevallier said, citing reduced penis size in male fish, masculinized female fish and other sex-related changes.<br />
<br />
Because the synthetic estrogen is not absorbed well into the body, much of the drug is released into the environment through women's urine, he said. In addition, used contraceptive rings and patches are having a further polluting effect, he said.<br />
<br />
Noting that in Europe, drug manufacturers are required to provide a bag for disposal or return of used contraceptive devices, LeChevallier recommended that the U.S. adopt the same policy. "Why do pharmaceutical companies here get a free ride?" he asked.<br />
<br />
He said touting the environmental benefits of natural family planning "can be a new way to evangelize youths" and attract them to the church-approved method of postponing pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Ruppersberger explained the various forms of natural family planning in use today and said, "If you want to stop the abortion mentality, you have to stop contraception."<br />
<br />
He said birth control pills are sometimes prescribed for women with excessive menstrual cramping or bleeding, endometriosis and even acne.<br />
<br />
"I have not had any problem in my practice without writing a prescription for birth control," he added. "People don't die from acne, but they do die from complications of birth control."<br />
<br />
Ruppersberger said the new tools available to help couples practice natural family planning include the OV watch, which is worn while sleeping and notifies women four days before ovulation; Persona, a handheld fertility device currently available only in Europe; and OvaCue, a fertility monitor that detects electrolytes in a woman's saliva to predict ovulation.<br />
<br />
He also said the Internet is increasingly being used to teach natural family planning. "If the evil one can use the Internet for pornography, we can use it to teach NFP and respect for life," he said.<br />
<br />
Ruppersberger outlined some of the medical effects of contraceptives on the human body -- cancers, infections, cardiovascular complications, effects on the liver and the death of the woman, not to mention the death of an unborn child in an abortion when contraceptives fail.<br />
<br />
The use of contraceptives also has been shown to result in increased depression in the women who take them, decreased self-esteem, increased divorce rates and increased teen promiscuity and pregnancy rates, he said.<br />
<br />
Barillas' presentation focused on the "distinctly Catholic approach to environmental concerns," which she said is neither "a new message for us" nor "an issue that is out there just for people who live close to the woods."<br />
<br />
Of special concern for Catholics is the fact that "the poor and powerless are most likely to bear the burden of our environmental carelessness," she said.<br />
<br />
"The poor, the elderly and persons with disabilities often are exposed to multiple contaminants," Barillas said, adding that children especially are at risk because they suffer "greater exposure pound for pound" and have a "diminished ability to detoxify and excrete many chemical toxins."<br />
<br />
Unborn children also face many environmental risks, including lead, mercury, pesticides and other chemicals, she said.<br />
<br />
Many of those concerns are being addressed by the Catholic Coalition for Children and a Safe Environment and other organizations, she said</font>
