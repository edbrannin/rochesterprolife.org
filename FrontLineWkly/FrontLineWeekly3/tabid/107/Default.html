<p xcomment="_fckxhtmljob=12"><font size="4">The 'Lambs of Christ' were out in front of Planned Parenthood praying the Rosary, for the ending of the baby killing that is going on in our Nation &amp; around the World &amp; for those that are doing this abominable act against God &amp; His children.&#160; There was a good turn out of faithful Catholics witnessing their Faith in the community.&#160; They are not hiding their light under a bushel basket.&#160; Public witnessing is what is needed to end ABORTION.&#160; I gave to Mary Quinn the City Newspaper, of the Carol Love article&#160;&amp; the filers of the Pro Life Mass on next Saturday, June 21st at 12 noon which will be celebrated by Fr. John Reif, a devoted priest in the Lord's service.&#160;She said that she would bring some of the filers to The Church of the Holy Spirit, in Webster.&#160; Thanks Mary and&#160;the Lambs of Christ for all that you do for God's little ones.&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p xcomment="_fckxhtmljob=12"><font size="4">I've noticed that some of the workers that we witnessed to over the years are no longer driving out of the parking lot.&#160; One young woman Michelle&#160;is a Catholic from St. Paul's parish, &amp; the other woman Debbie&#160;is a ,so called Christian she professes, who once said to me that she worked in the "clean section".&#160; No such area in Planned Parenthood, sorry Debbie&#160;that you are deceiving yourself.&#160; I don't know if they have left &amp; have repented or if they just got another job &amp; still are in the mind set that it is okay to murder God's children by Abortion &amp; Birth Control?&#160; We're praying for you Michelle &amp; Debbie.&#160; Michelle might have had a baby &amp; if she did &amp; quite her job to take care of her child. &#160;I only hope &amp; pray that she will reflect on her actions at Planned Parenthood, over the many years that she worked there.&#160;She acted as a 'Death Escort' at one time &amp; also gave donations of $ to Planned Parenthood according to past Annual&#160;Reports of Planned Parenthood that I received.&#160;&#160;She&#160;was also a &#160;'Rape Counselor' there at Planned Parenthood &amp;&#160;testified against me in Federal Court, back in 1999 in Buffalo, NY, where PP wanted us pro lifers to be in a 'Buffer Zone' in front of their building.&#160; I forgive you Michelle for you know not what you do.&#160;</font></p>
<p xcomment="_fckxhtmljob=12"><font size="4">Over the years many staff people have left Planned Parenthood's 'Killing Mill'.&#160; I pray that you all have "REPENTED" and are living a life in Christ Jesus.&#160; For those who have died, over the years,&#160;I only hope &amp; pray that before you took your final breathe that you all&#160;'REPENTED'.&#160;</font></p>

<p xcomment="_fckxhtmljob=12"><font size="4">A car stopped, on the street, &amp; asked Martha &amp; I for directions.&#160; The black woman driver said to us that she was pregnant with twins, a boy &amp; a girl.&#160;&#160;She then&#160;said that Planned Parenthood wanted her to have an abortion.&#160; She said that she almost did but changed her mind.&#160; I said to her back "don't let your babies hear that".&#160; She smiled.&#160; Yes, the baby the womb can &amp; does pick up on the emotions of the mother, either her stress or her calmness.&#160; What doctors are finding out now about what the baby experiences in their mother's wombs in extraordinary.&#160; She then said I have my four other children with me &amp; then the back window came down &amp; there were 3 beautiful people in the back of the van.&#160; The other young adult was in the front of the van, next to her mother.&#160; They all looked in their teens.&#160; Martha then said to the mom, that we have baby clothes at the Focus Pregnancy Help Center &amp; for her to drive in the parking lot a little ways down the street&#160;&amp; receive some.&#160; Martha then walked to the center &amp; blessed the family with the beautiful baby clothes &amp; items from which we received on Wednesday by Don.&#160;Thanks again Don &amp; I will request more baby clothes&#160;on Monday.&#160; She also took a Truth packet &amp; the other literature that we have in the center.&#160; She said that she especially wanted some on Chastity &amp; Marriage &amp; Abstinence because one of her children will be going off to college soon.&#160; Great Mom!!&#160;&#160; She was so happy &amp; grateful &amp; we were happy too.&#160; We will be calling her in the near future with some&#160;more things for her twins.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One very angry woman stated to Martha "I'm not here for an abortion but I want you to shut up and go away.&#160; The pro lifer kept on counseling then the angry woman said again&#160; "If you don't stop talking I'm going to have to kick your butt".&#160;&#160;She then continued to stay angry as Martha continued to pray &amp; counsel.&#160; She finally left with a driver &amp; as they left she threw a stick out the window at the sidewalk counselor.&#160; We can only pray for her but we are not standing targets of the wrath of some of these people.&#160; We do get license plate&#160;numbers &amp; people have had to go to court &amp; one was arrested &amp; spent the night in jail &amp; had to do&#160;20 hours of Community Service for throwing something at me at night.&#160; So watch out for you might be next.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Similar situation happened with an angry woman across the street at the Midtown Vets .&#160; She was in her car on the cell phone hollering out profanities to the Martha who was across the street counseling.&#160; Maybe she is Post Abortive for if you were Pro Life you would be supportive &amp; not abusive.&#160; God have mercy on&#160;her soul.&#160;&#160;The people at the Vets, including the doctor of animals, haven't spoken to us ever,&#160;who are out on the sidewalk, in all the 13 years that we have&#160; been out there.&#160; Just save the animals doc &amp; not the&#160;babies across the street at Planned Parenthood where&#160;they are being slaughtered.&#160; Go figure!!!&#160; Maybe they, the doctor &amp; staff,&#160;don't believe in abortion &amp; they&#160;do do something to try to end it but to be silent to us for 13 years makes me wonder.&#160;Only God knows &amp; will be the Judge when they stand before Him someday.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">One gentleman who was walking on the sidewalk stopped to speak to Martha.&#160; He told her that he was going into Planned Parenthood to get condoms.&#160; He was counseled by Martha &amp; took a Truth packet &amp; a Rosary &amp; didn't go into the Killing Mill.&#160; Thank God.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Martha had a commitment so it was Tucker &amp; I tonight.&#160; He could only stay an hour so we planned to be on the sidewalk from 5 PM to 6 PM.&#160; It would be better to be there for an hour than not at all.&#160; When I got there I gave out a Truth packet right away.&#160; Then another, I was glad of this.&#160; As i was taking to two guys &amp; a girl that they picked up another was coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walking towards me on the sidewalk &amp; she was crying.&#160; I stopped talking with the 3 young people driving out of the parking lot &amp; went over to the young girl.&#160; I said "are you okay" &amp; she said while crying "I'm pregnant".&#160; I said "that's okay, we can help you".&#160; Then she said "I don't want it" "you don't understand I'm 16".&#160; I said "you had sex &amp; please don't have your baby killed &amp; please take a packet there's information in it that can help you".&#160; "Leave me alone, stop talking"&#160;she said &amp; as she was walking towards Gibbs I hollered to her "tour baby has a heartbeat, please don't kill your baby".&#160; As she was walking she did see the pictures of the aborted babies on the sidewalk &amp; hopefully that will make a difference in her attitude.&#160; Earlier I said to her that her baby was now growing inside her &amp; it was a good thing not a bad thing.&#160; Where was her Mother &amp; Father&#160;&amp; who was this guy that was messing with a 16 year old.&#160; I can now only prayer for her &amp; I hope that she will not have an abortion.&#160; Please Lord.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A young kid was driving out of Planned Parenthood &amp; had to stop for the traffic.&#160; I asked him what was he doing in a place like this?&#160; He was combative right away.&#160; He protested to much.&#160; He hollered "what if she was rapped"?&#160; They always say that.&#160; I answered that the baby should not die for the crime of the father, that was not fair &amp; it made no sense.&#160; Boy did he get mad, he hollered all the way down the street.&#160; A nerve was hit.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A car screamed by "get a job" wow how original.&#160; I hollered back "repent from your evil".</font></p>
<p><font size="4">One of the black workers turned up her music when she left &amp; gave me her middle finger through the sun roof of her car.&#160; Better to get a reaction then no reaction at least there is hope.&#160; They are not completely gone.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A car was in the street &amp; had slowed down &amp; I hollered "would you like a packet of information"?&#160; To which she replied "yes".&#160; So I went into the street &amp; gave it to her &amp;&#160; she said "thank you" with a big smile on her face.&#160; I replied " you are welcome".&#160; I was back on the sidewalk when 2 girls were walking up the street.&#160; They looked at the graphic pictures &amp; I offered them a Truth packet to which they both took one.&#160; The one girl said " I won't ever have another abortion again, I had two &amp; I would never do it again".&#160; The other girl said " I had one &amp; would never do it again".&#160; I felt sick, between the two girls 3 children died.&#160; This is such a difficult ministry though an important one.&#160; I pulled out of the packet the Project Rachel brochure &amp; told them to call that number &amp; get more help.&#160; I asked them if they asked the Lord to forgive them &amp; they said "yes".&#160; Thank God.&#160; The one girl said that a pill killed her baby so that makes me think that Planned Parenthood is also using RU 486.&#160; They use anything to kill children&#160;- murders.&#160; As we were talking &amp; the girls said that they needed to go they had an appointment.&#160; I was&#160;looking away for a moment &amp; when I looked&#160;back I saw them going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I couldn't even say a word.&#160; This is hard.&#160; least htey weren't going in for abortion &amp; if they were there for birth control the packet will tell them about that.&#160; Another girl came out &amp; I spoke with her &amp; she said that she didn't have an abortion that she was there for her annual.&#160; I told her that they target the black race &amp; she agreed &amp; came over &amp; took a Truth packet &amp; smiled at me in a nice way.&#160; I waved good-bye to her&#160;&amp; said "God bless you" as she was leaving.&#160; A young woman came out of Planned parenthood with a baby in a stroller &amp; walked passed me &amp; she took a Truth packets too.&#160; Her baby was beautiful &amp; I said that she was blessed.&#160; She smiled.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Now the strangest of all was a young girl &amp; guy were walking down the street together.&#160; I offered them a packet &amp; the girl replied in a high pitched voice "do you have about five of these I want to hand them out to other places where I go".&#160; I said I have 4 here &amp; come follow me to the pregnancy center &amp; I'll get another one for you".&#160; So they agreed &amp; followed me into the center.&#160; I opened the door to the center &amp; turned on the light &amp; she asked me "what do you do here"/&#160; I told her that we do pregnancy tests &amp; hand out literature &amp; baby clothes to the moms.&#160; I just received a model from Focus on the Family of 4 stages of development of a baby that was 7-8-- 9 &amp; 10 weeks old.&#160; She looked at he models intently.&#160; They looked around &amp; said good-bye &amp; left.&#160; I had a strange feeling which is called a "gut" feeling to which we should listen to better but sometimes we don't.&#160; As I was closing the door to the center&amp; walking down the hallway to go back outside I saw that she had dropped all the 5 packets in the hallway.&#160; I was glad that if this was her plan all along that she dropped them where i could retrieve them so I could use them again, which later on I did.&#160; Thank God I wasn't hurt or killed in the center as Tucker was on the sidewalk.&#160; Thank you Lord for protecting me.&#160; Maybe sh was post abortive &amp; the baby models caused her pain &amp; she ran out dropping the packets.&#160; Don't know.&#160; It was strange.&#160; I hope &amp; pray the best for these 2 young kids.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Tucker had to go so we put the signs back in the closet &amp; I then went into the great room to fix something when the doorbell rang.&#160; I went to the door to see a young woman at the door.&#160; She asked if her daughter could see the pictures of the aborted babies.&#160; She said that she was the one to get the packet from me on the street earlier &amp; wanted to come back but we were gone&#160;so he saw our sign &amp; stopped in.&#160; I gave her daughter a packet and her friend &amp; the lady next door at the Beauty Salon &amp; her daughter&#160;&amp; son a packet, so I was glad that I had enough.&#160; They als loooked&#160;at the signs &amp; almost cried at what abortion does to babies.&#160; They said that they hated Planned Parenthood for&#160;they know what they do in there.&#160; The Mom took some literature &amp; some&#160;toddler clothes &amp; some trucks &amp; a stuffed animal for&#160;her young son.&#160; It was a blessed &amp; fruitful experience for me &amp; for them.&#160; They did say that they knew 2 girls that has had an abortion so I gave them some more information for the girls to get the help that they needed.&#160; There were&#160;7 people in the center, at one time &amp; all were receptive to the Truth.&#160; Amen sisters &amp; brothers.&#160; This was a pleasant surprise.&#160; The one lady needed baby clothes for her niece so I gave her the Woman's Care Center to call.&#160; Also I gave her some things &amp; asked&#160;her to come back next Wednesday for more baby clothes.&#160; This was great!!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I was doing some&#160;straightening out in the center&#160;when the doorbell rang again when a man asked me if I saw anything for his car was hit &amp; the driver&#160;drove&#160;away.&#160; I told him that I didn't &amp; I was sorry that that happened to him.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">What an evening.&#160; I gave&#160;out about 9 Truth packets.&#160;&#160;I am worried about the young girl that&#160;is&#160;pregnant &amp; crying please pray for her &amp; her baby that she will "Choose Life".&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Our new friend had brought her girlfriend with her to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center &amp; her story is that she got pregnant when she was 14 years old &amp; is still with the father of her baby.&#160; Where are her parents &amp; why did this guy get away with having sex with her at 14.&#160; Yes we are glad that she did not have her baby killed for the sin of the father.&#160; She showed Martha her arm that had a band aid on it &amp; she told Martha&#160; that she just had her Depo&#160; shot at Planned Parenthood &amp; got condoms to boot.&#160; She is 17 year sold &amp; has a 3 year old child to think of.&#160; How does this happen??&#160; Worn out sexually at 17 &amp; prone to sexually transmitted diseases thanks to Planned Parenthood.&#160; The Depo shot acts as an early abortion, at times, now&#160; she is responsible for abortions earlier on.&#160; Plus she is ruining her reproductive organs &amp; emotional health&#160;&amp; her immortal soul, which is the most important of all.&#160; What a mess!!!&#160; Help her Lord &amp; her child.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A girl who was sitting in a car in the parking lot of Planned Parenthood got out of the car &amp; walked over to Martha &amp; said that she supported her friend's abortion because she had a rotten life.&#160; So what her friend was saying was&#160;that her friends baby had to die because she had had a terrible life, meaning the friend's life.&#160; Now we are supporting the killing of other women's children because we had a lousy life.&#160; This nightmare never ends it only gets worse.&#160; I couldn't make up what people are saying &amp; doing.&#160; Come Lord Jesus come!!!</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Saturday, June 28, in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="4">When I arrived to the sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood the Lambs of Christ were praying on the other side of the building.&#160; Cathy on on the other side near Buckpitt holding her "I Regret My Abortion" sign.&#160; I went into the center to do some things &amp; came back out &amp; held my Malachi graphic sign.&#160; I spoke with Cathy for a little bit &amp; noticed that there were 3 old timers still wearing their blue Planned Parenthood&#160;apron &amp;&#160;waiting to prey on their next victim. One of the Death Escorts likes to clean up the area around Planned Parenthood &amp; she gets her barrel &amp; starts to do some weeding around the flowers that are in front of Planned Parenthood. I only wish that she cared more about the children that are murdered, in cold blood in Planned Parenthood, than the flowers that she cares for.&#160;&#160;Your&#160;priorities are all wrong Sylvia Rose.&#160;The other 2 Death Escorts,&#160;Marsha Peone&#160;&amp;&#160;Barry Whitehead just watch.&#160; These 3 stooges have been their for years. &#160;Sooooooo sad.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I noticed, after I was there for awhile, that no one was coming into PP &amp; the parking lot was empty so I decided to go to Church &amp; be with the Lord before Mass started at 12:10 PM.&#160; After Mass I went back to Planned Parenthood &amp; held my Crucifix &amp; a graphic sign.&#160; I had my literature &amp; rosaries with me also.&#160; A veteran pro lifer drove by &amp; handed me $20 for he Focus Pregnancy Help Center, Thank you so very much good lady.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">It was now about 12:50 PM &amp; a car drove into the parking lot.&#160; A young&#160; girl was with a young&#160;guy, who was on the passenger side of the car.&#160; She hollered out he window "I'm not gong to have an abortion".&#160; I said "good but please don't come hear &amp; patronize this horrible place".&#160; As she was getting out of the car &amp; heading to the door I hollered out to her that birth control kills babies early on.&#160; She went to the door &amp; tried to get in but they had locked the doors early because they didn't have much business today, thank God &amp; they wanted to get home early.&#160; As I was trying to give her information she told me to" shut my sorry mouth up" &amp; preceded to go insane that the doors were locked.&#160; I swear that&#160;she looked like an animal that had just gotten their leg caught in a trap.&#160; It was a sad sight to see.&#160; As she was leaving I said to her that her life was a mess &amp; to repent &amp; she sped down University Ave madder than a wet hen.&#160; What is her life like?&#160; And where is she going?&#160; She is addicted to Planned Parenthood &amp; their drugs &amp; their EVIL services.&#160; I pray that her life will change by the grace of God.&#160; &#160;</font></p>

<p>&#160;<strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Wednesday, July 2, 2008 in fron of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;A young girl was walking down the street &amp; went into the walk way of Planned Parenthood &amp; sat down on the bench in front of the place.&#160; I hollered over to her that we had help for her in a literature packet &amp; then&#160;she walked over to us.&#160; She said that she practices safe sex &amp; that last night her boyfriends condom broke &amp; that she was here for the Morning after Pill.&#160; I said to her that the only safe sex was no sex &amp; that the Morning after Pill can cause an abortion early on to which she replied "I don't care".&#160; I said to her that she might not care but that her baby does. She then turned around &amp; walked off in a huff into the parking lot.&#160; I didn't see her go into Planned Parenthood but a short time later I saw her ride out of the parking lot as a passenger in a car driven by a female driver.&#160; I hollered out to her to "save yourself for marriage &amp; don't kill any babies".&#160;&#160;I only hope &amp; pray that she will listen.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A lot of positive response from the people driving by us on the sidewalk&#160;but of course not without a few obscene gestures in the mix.&#160; We're used to that.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A 3 foot doll was given to me by a nice lady at the Second Hand Store that I go to a lot.&#160; I had a baby stroller in the car so now I try to put the doll in the stroller &amp; leave her on the sidewalk near where we sidewalk counsel.&#160; It hopefully helps people to realize that the same baby, in the womb, is the same baby outside of the womb. That he or she is a person not a glob of tissue.&#160; How strange that Planned Parenthood still uses that terminology to get the girls to have their babies killed.&#160; It's mind control for the girls.&#160; It seems okay to scrap a glob of tissues out of you, before it turns into a baby, then to kill a baby.&#160; You're just really only killing the tissue &amp; not the baby?&#160; How they mess up the minds of these girls &amp; ruin their lives forever by their deception.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Martha &amp; I were saying our Rosary when we saw a young guy &amp; a young girl come&#160;out of the side street, they were dressed up in nice clothes.&#160; He was sort of dancing as he was walking.&#160; They were on the other side of the street.&#160; I hollered over to them asking if they would like a Rosary to which they said "yes" &amp; crossed over to us.&#160; They asked us some questions &amp; we gave them a Truth packet &amp; a Rosary each.&#160; We showed them the plastic&#160;10 week old babies that I just got from Focus on the Family, they are an educational tool.&#160; We also offered them a DVD of a&#160;animated bloodless abortion, which is also a teaching tool.&#160;We looked in the bag &amp; couldn't find it &amp; they said that it was okay &amp; that they had to go &amp; went hurriedly off back to where they came from, down the side street.&#160; Just then we found it &amp; I walked hurriedly to catch up to them to give it to them.&#160; I&#160;finally caught up to them &amp; they took it &amp; said "thank you"&#160;&amp; I then went back to Martha.&#160; I felt a little uneasy about the couple but everything went well.&#160; I did think then when I turned the corner of the street I'd see the Truth packet on the ground, which I didn't.&#160; They still had the packet when I gave them the DVD.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; The more you know the more you can help others young people.&#160; The President of PP,Carol Love, drove out of the Killing Mill &amp; I showed her my Rosary &amp; said to her&#160;that we were praying for her immortal soul.&#160; We pray for all of the people of Planned Parenthood that they will REPENT &amp; Stop Killing Children.&#160; The neighbor Kathy, who walks her two dogs went by us.&#160; We just have to be careful that her nice dogs don't pee on our signs.&#160; As if we have time for that.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;Just a few minutes later a young guy &amp; a young girl came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; went&#160;to sit down on the bench in front of the place.&#160; They both took out a cigarette &amp; started to smoke.&#160; I said to them "I only hope &amp; pray that you didn't bring in a girl here to have an abortion" to which the young guy replied that if you don't shut up I'll call the police".&#160; I replied that we had a right of freedom of speech &amp; this was a protest &amp; if you didn't like you could leave".&#160; They just sat there smoking.&#160; Martha&#160;started to talk but she did it in a way that wasn't so direct to them but indirect information that was&#160;informative.&#160; Sort of like talking to the building but you still had to hear it if you&#160;were nearby.&#160; Great technique &amp; it seems to work.&#160;&#160;They then went inside.&#160; We didn't like this situation at all.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">As we were standing there witnessing, the alarm went off at Buckpitt the building next to Planned Parenthood.&#160; We just figured that the guy that had gone in would turn it off, but he didn't.&#160; It just went on screeching.&#160; The police were called probably by the death security guard at Planned Parenthood, because a few minutes later a police car drove up.&#160; He looked out of his window &amp; said "hi to me" &amp; went into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood &amp; went over to the car where the death security was.&#160; A few minutes later &#160;another police car stopped &amp; an officer got out.&#160; He walked over to Buckpitt &amp; I followed.&#160; He asked where the sound was coming from &amp; I said that it was coming from Buckpitt.&#160; He said that the&#160;address he was given was 114 University &amp; I said that it wasn't Planned Parenthood but here at Buckpitt.&#160; Martha was putting away the signs.&#160; As&#160;I was walking by the building the police officer said for me not to go by the doorway because the person in there might have a gun.&#160; A gun!!!&#160; Never thought of that.&#160; I asked if he was going to&#160;ring the bell &amp; he said that h was waiting for back up, that he wasn't going to go into the building alone.&#160; Good thinking officer.&#160; I'll be right out here if you need anything.&#160; This felt like Cops &amp; Robbers.&#160; What could happen next!&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Maybe losing a foot or two.&#160;The back up officer came so fast down the street that when he got&#160;to the sidewalk I thought he was going to jump the curb where I was standing.&#160; Please ring the doorbell &amp; tell the goofy guy in there to turn off the alarm.&#160; Just then the alarm goes off &amp; the &#160;guy comes out.&#160; The officer is now talking to him after sending the other officer back to where he came from, for everything was under control.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; No one had to die, thank God.&#160; As the man went into his van to leave the officer came to where I was standing to back into his car.&#160; He said that the guy was lucky for when he heard the door open he was going for his gun.&#160; His gun, oh no!!&#160; I said to the officer "you shoot first then ask questions" he&#160;laughed.&#160; He was a nice officer but a little nervous which I can't blame him for there is so much crazy stuff going on now in this city.&#160;I just guess that I'm numb to what goes on there, for so much does go on. &#160;I said&#160;"good bye &amp; God bless you" to which he replied "God bless you too".&#160; I hope that the rest of your evening goes better for you.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">As this was all&#160;going on my favorite lady Sonia drove by hollering out her window "thank you", "No" I said "thank you Sonia", for she makes my evening.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Just then we noticed that the guy, who was smoking with the girl on the bench earlier,&#160;came out of Planned Parenthood alone &amp; was walking up the street towards Scio St.&#160; The girl came out out about 20 minutes later &amp; I&#160;started to talk to her.&#160; I said that we cared &amp; that we loved her &amp; wanted to help her.&#160; She was leaning on her car &amp; then walked over to the sidewalk &amp; looked up the&#160;street.&#160; I pointed left to her indicating that the guy went up the street &amp; turned left but she was mad at me.&#160; It's not&#160;the first time.&#160; She went back over to her car &amp; I started to talk to her again offering her a Truth packet.&#160; Martha was in the center so I was alone.&#160; I told the young&#160;girl that I would leave the packet by the tree on the sidewalk &amp; if she wanted it she could come over to take it.&#160; Well the next thing she did was to walk over to the police that was still there talking to the death security guard.&#160;&#160;Don't it figure, just when&#160;you think you're reaching the girl she goes ahead &amp;&#160;tries to have you arrested.&#160; Go figure!!&#160;&#160;Martha came&#160;back out onto the sidewalk &amp; I told her that the young girl went over to the police officer who was there in the Planned Parenthood parking lot.&#160; How convenient for her, she didn't even have to make a phone call.&#160; The police was already there.&#160; Well&#160; he never came over to me, I guess he probably told her about the First Amendment rights or the Freedom of Speech rights&#160;or something like that.&#160; I then helped Martha get the rest of the&#160;signs &amp; we went into the center to do some baby clothes sorting.&#160; We were tired &amp; left the center around 8:45 PM.&#160; What an evening.!!!&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Martha, Jerry &amp; Charles were there witnessing to Life.&#160; Bill's van was in the shop otherwise he'd be there too.&#160; A young girl came out of Planned Planned &amp; walked over to Martha, on the sidewalk.&#160; She looked sad &amp; Martha asked her if she had had an abortion.&#160; The girl replied that she had an abortion about 6 months ago &amp; was miserable.&#160; She took a packet which has Post Abortion information in it &amp; phone #'s for help. Then she sated to cry &amp; held on to Martha's hands for dear life, she wouldn't let go for a very long time.&#160; Martha comforted her.&#160; How sad.&#160; That's what Planned Parenthood does to lives of innocent people in &amp; out of the womb.&#160; They are destroyers of LIFE!!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">On the other side of the street a young girl &amp; her mother were walking down on the sidewalk.&#160; Martha hollered over to them &amp; offered them a Rosary.&#160; They both crossed the street &amp; approached Martha.&#160; The mother said to Martha that she was a blessing from God (which we all know that's true).&#160; The mother Martha that her daughter had an abortion 6 months ago &amp; that it was devastating to her daughter &amp; to her too.&#160; It sounded that the mother didn't know about the abortion until it was done.&#160; How horrible.&#160; She said that her daughter learned her lesson &amp; her daughter nodded her head in agreement.&#160; They took a Truth packet &amp; went on their way.&#160; Thank you guys for being there &amp; witnessing the Truth&amp; giving out literature that can help the wounded.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Six young girls came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; got into a van, as they were driving out of the parking lot the driver stopped the van &amp; said to Martha to come here.&#160; She went over &amp; the girl handed her the bag of condoms saying that she didn't need them.&#160; They had heard Martha talk about condoms, on the mega phone &amp; were convicted.&#160; Praise God!&#160; She took a Truth packet &amp; they left wiser &amp; freer then ever before in their lives.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">When Martha is out there on a Thursday afternoon she keeps on talking &amp; giving out information on the mega phone continuously.&#160; Just then a man came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; went over to Martha for he said that he had heard her speak about how Planned Parenthood targets the Black Race.&#160; He wanted a Truth packet which she gave him with a smile on her beautiful face.&#160; Go Martha!!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Looked like a mother &amp; daughter team coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; They both got into a car &amp; the daughter slumped down in the seat as they went out.&#160; I pray that she didn't have her sweet baby murdered in there.&#160; God forgive us!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Unfortunately there were many cars that drove by showing their IQ by putting up their middle finger.&#160; I can only say Repent for you won't be at peace until you do.&#160; You are only fooling yourself after the devil made you do it.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The team was out on the front lines from 1PM to 3:30PM &amp; handed out 5 Truth packets.&#160;Great job!!</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&#160;<strong><font color="#0000ff">&#160;Saturday, July 5, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I got at the front lines late this morning.&#160; Martha called &amp; she was sick &amp; couldn't make it.&#160;&#160;When I got there Maria was talking&#160;to a young girl with a small boy with her .&#160; I got out of the car &amp; went over to them.&#160;The girl is pregnant &amp; I offered her some baby clothes at the center.&#160; She said that she was waiting for a ride but came to the center with me.&#160; I gave her some baby clothes &amp; her son some toys, which he was happy to receive.&#160; I said to her that we are out on the street on Wednesdays &amp; for her to come back to get more, I hope that she does.&#160; We went back to the sidewalk &amp; her ride came to pick her up.&#160; She also took 2 Truth packets.&#160; What nice girl.&#160;</font></p>
<p align="center">&#160;</p>
<p><font size="4">Maria &amp; I were putting her things away.&#160; I was bending down to get some of her things that were on the sidewalk &amp; I heard a man's voice right next to me saying "how many kids have you adopted".&#160; I raised myself up &amp; lit into him like a flash of lightening.&#160; I used my outdoor voice &amp; said that under no circumstance do you kill a baby.&#160; He then said "what are you going to do with all these kids that are being born."&#160; Again I used an octave higher than the first time I responded to his stupid statement.&#160; He then said "you don't have to scream"&#160; I said "yes I do".&#160; Maria also tried to reason with him to no avail.&#160; He then said "you both are Terrorist &amp; Home Land Security should be notified".&#160; Just call them, I'd love to have a chat with them, mister.&#160; He then walked away going up the street still talking.&#160; Good bye &amp; don't stop to say anything stupid to me again.&#160; My tolerance of ignorance is growing thin.&#160; I also said to him that no one can adopt a baby because Planned Parenthood is killing them,&#160; Poor babies, adults should be protecting you not killing you.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Maria left &amp; I did too.&#160; I headed over to Mass at Our Lady of Victory.&#160; After Mass I went back to Planned Parenthood, it was about 12:40.&#160; I got my Malachi graphic picture 1 Truth packet that I had in the car, &amp; some Rosaries.&#160; I was witnessing when I saw a young girl come out of Planned Parenthood with a small baby.&#160; I hate this scenario the most, a mother &amp; her baby or child, being at the Killing Mill.&#160; Poor children to be subjected to this Evil.&#160; I was talking to her but she said nothing back to me &amp; got into the van with her baby.&#160; As she was pulling out I offered her the packet &amp; she stopped the van in the street &amp; I went over to her to give her the information.&#160; I then asked how old her child was &amp; she said he was 3 months old.&#160; I then said that we had baby clothes in the center &amp; if she wanted any all she had to do was to follow me over there, which she did.&#160;&#160;Mother &amp; baby&#160;came into the center &amp; we talked for at least 45 minutes.&#160; She &amp; her story touched my heart.&#160; She had a head on her shoulder &amp; is a good person.&#160; Her mother told her &amp; her sister that if you "make a baby then you take care of the baby".&#160; Good advise mom &amp; they both took it.&#160; I gave her bay clothes &amp; more literature from the literature table.&#160; I will call Mathew's Closet for her &amp; her sister so they can get more things to help them along.&#160; Also, I mentioned to her that we will be there on Wednesday &amp; for her sister who has twins, a boy&#160; a girl to stop by &amp; we'll give the 6 month old babies what we have.&#160; She said that she will tell her sister that hopefully she'll stop next Wednesday.&#160; It was such a pleasure to talk to this nice person &amp; she was so receptive to the Truth.&#160; I hope to see her again.&#160; She is in my prayers for she had an emergency C-Section &amp; lost a lot of blood &amp; the doctors wanted to give her a blood transfusion but she being Jehovah Witness refused.&#160; She has fainting episodes for she is weak from the blood loss.&#160; I told her that the Lord would want her to do what it takes to get healthy, for her son &amp; herself too.&#160; You are in my prayers &amp; heart dear one.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There were 17 Lambs of Christ praying in front of the Killing Mill Planned Parenthood saying the Rosary &amp; singing songs for Baby Killing&#160;will stop.&#160; Kathy was holding her sign 'I Regret My Abortion' &amp; I was on the other side of the driveway, sidewalk counseling.&#160; Martha was out of town.&#160; A man was fixing his car in the parking lot &amp; I tried to talk to him.&#160; Cars were going in &amp; people that I called out to had no&#160;reaction on their faces, which is scary, just a blank look.&#160; The Death Escorts are evil acting, as they&#160;lead their victims into this hell hole Planned Parenthood.&#160; &#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I went to Mass &amp; then came back to Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was holding Malachi, sweet aborted baby picture &amp; used my mega phone to try to reach a couple of people.&#160; Greg drove by &amp; honked &amp; Rick the mailman waved, a car with a young man honked &amp; waved at me &amp; Maria stopped to talk.&#160; As Maria &amp; I were talking, she said that the Lord lead her to go down University Ave. instead of Scio St., thank you Lord,&#160;two young&#160;girls came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; took&#160;a Truth packet each.&#160; I only brought 2 packets&#160;out of the center so I was glad that I had enough.&#160; We have been, on an average, been giving away about 10-15 packets out in a weeks time.&#160; Thank God.&#160;</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Wednesday July 16, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="4">When I got to the front lines of the Killing Mill, Planned Parenthood, Tucker was starting to put up the signs.&#160; I got out of the car &amp; walked to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center to get the literature packets &amp; mega phone, then I went to my spot by the tree, on the sidewalk to witness &amp; counsel.&#160; Three girls came out &amp; one girl was wearing pants so short that you hardly believe it &amp; one girl was so nasty when I offered them a Truth packet.&#160; She hollered over to me, as she was crossing the street, to "get a man".&#160; I then told her to "get some morals".&#160; The girls just don't get it.&#160;It's because of the men that they choose that they end up in a physical, mental, emotional &amp; spiritual mess.&#160; A good man would treat you with love &amp; respect &amp; would want was best for you &amp; his goal would be for you to get to Heaven.&#160; He would be kind in speech &amp; action &amp; he wouldn't want sex with you until he makes you his wife.&#160; The girls are giving themselves to these creepy guys that don't care about them at all.&#160; Love is doing what is right for the person.&#160; Lust is doing what is bad for the person.&#160;</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size="4">I heard a voice next to me &amp; I suddenly turned around only to see Matthew standing there with his camera.&#160; I said "hi" to him &amp; it was good seeing him again &amp; that I had put his other pictures that he took of Ryan, little Ryan &amp; I on this web site. He was glad to hear that.&#160; He stayed &amp; took pictures of us &amp; PP's clients for 1 1/2 hours.&#160; I gave him 2 DVD's.&#160; One was a bloodless abortion, which was animated, &amp; the other was a 4D Ultrasound of pictures of an unborn baby.&#160; He was receptive of these 2 educational gifts.&#160; He said that "we had passion" &amp; he liked that.&#160; How could we not have passion against the slaughtering of God's littlest ones.&#160; Matthew's web site: </font><a href="http://matthewburkharttphoto.com/display?enter=true"><strong><font size="4">http://matthewburkharttphoto.com/display?enter=true</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="4">I was walking back from the Center when Bill arrived.&#160; He was coming to put&#160;more data, on the computer's spreadsheet, of the clients we have seen so far.&#160; Well, he ended up on the sidewalk first &amp; stayed until 7:15pm.&#160; Thanks&#160;Bill for your time &amp; work for the Center.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Two young girls&#160;came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; got into their cars &amp; stopped at the entrance of the driveway to tell me that I was&#160;unloving to be hollering &amp;&#160;in showing these graphic pictures.&#160; &#160;I told her that I disagreed with her &amp; that it was loving to call out to the girls to offer them information &amp; help &amp; that these graphic pictures have saved lives.&#160; &#160;I also informed her that Planned Parenthood has made sure that we couldn't;t get close enough to the girls to speak to them, in a normal voice, to get the information &amp; help that they need &amp; deserve.&#160; Planned Parenthood doesn't want them to get the Truth &amp; turn away.&#160; Bad&#160;for business.&#160; As she was putting up the car window I had the last word, as always, &amp; said "why would you be at a Killing Mill"? as they sped away.&#160;&#160;Please think about it girls.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A couple more packets were given out.&#160;&#160;As I was speaking to a young girl who&#160;just had come out of PP&#160;&amp; walked over to m, a car&#160;had pulled into the parking lot &amp; the window came down.&#160; The lady said that she had a question for me.&#160; I said "okay come on over".&#160; So&#160;she pulled into the parking lot&#160;&amp; parked &amp; came over as I was still speaking to the other girl.&#160; She took a packet &amp; &amp; said that if she needed any help please call one of the numbers that are in the packet", she smiled &amp; walked&#160;away.&#160; She said "what if a girl had been raped, is it then okay to have an abortion"?&#160; I said "no" "the baby should not die for the crime of the father, was that fair"?&#160; She said even if it was the grandfather or father or uncle"?&#160; I said "no".&#160; She then said "what if the baby will be born an Aids or cocaine baby with all sorts of problems"&#160; I said"no".&#160; She then said " What about all the orphans&#160;&#160;* their terrible lives".&#160; I said "no".&#160; Then I said to her "you have given me the worst scenarios &amp; no matter what the situation is the answer is still "NO" &amp; it can't be any other answer.&#160; Society &amp; the Churches &amp; Family&#160;are suppose to help those who are in need &amp; in&#160;difficult situations, to make their burden lighter.&#160; Having their baby murdered is not the answer &amp; is wrong &amp; Evil.&#160; &#160;Bottom line when you don't know what to do in a situation always let the baby live.&#160; Never have an abortion.&#160; The commandment of God is "Thou shall not kill".&#160; You'll never go wrong if you follow this &amp; don't play&#160;God. &#160;He is in control &amp;&#160;is the author of Life &amp; the decider of Death.&#160; She took a Truth packet &amp; left with peace in her heart because she works with pro-death women.&#160; Go now &amp; do the right thing dear heart &amp;&#160;pass on&#160;the Truth to others.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Bill witnessed with the sign of the 3 beautiful babies, that Tucker usually holds. this is what babies should look like.&#160; A lady had come over to me&#160; &amp; we had talked &amp; she said that she just had a Depo shot &amp; I told her about that abortion shot &amp; asked if she was married &amp; she said that she was.&#160;&#160;I went into the Center to get the Natural Family Planning brochures for her &amp; the people to call to get assistance.&#160; She was grateful for this information.&#160; I said for her to contact Ann, I knew her for many years &amp; that she is a Nurse Practitioner&#160;&amp; a nice person.&#160;She said that you &amp; off she went with&#160;a 'New Beginning'.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160;&#160;Then Bill told me that when I was in the Center a car had come by &amp; hollered out obscenities when he was holding the baby picture.&#160; I told him that this person was probably involved in an abortion &amp; he was mad that you were showing a picture of babies, for the loss of his child.&#160; We hope that he will repent.&#160; So many 'wounded hearts' of both men &amp; women because of abortion.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A young girl walked over to get a Truth packet &amp; then went back over to sit&#160;on the bench at PP &amp; started to read the literature.&#160; It was beautiful to behold.&#160; About&#160;15 minutes later&#160;a van pulled in&#160;to pick her up.&#160; As they were leaving, the van door opened &amp; a young man &amp; the woman who was sitting in the passenger side hollered over to me to&#160;get a packet.&#160; I thought that I was running short&#160;so I gave 1 more packet away to the people on the van &amp; all received a Rosary.&#160; WOW!!&#160;&#160; A person, who was not protesting, was kind enough to do my bidding.&#160; Thanks &amp; God bless you.&#160; They all drove away happy.&#160; Thank you for wanting the Truth.&#160;</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size="4">Two young boys were riding down the sidewalk on their bikes &amp; I was able to get a Rosary to the second cyclist, as he passed me by.&#160; I noticed that they had stopped a short ways down the sidewalk.&#160; Then a bike rider came to me asking for a Rosary.&#160; I figured that it was the first bike rider.&#160; He also asked for a Rosary for his 2 brothers &amp; 1 sister.&#160; Two blue &amp; one pink.&#160; He was grateful to receive the Rosaries.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">As&#160;Bill &amp;&#160;I&#160;were packing up around 6:40pm, Matthew had just left after taking many pictures &amp; talking with us &amp; observing, it now&#160;started to rain.&#160;Bill was by the tree, on the sidewalk in front of Buckpitt, when I saw that he was speaking to someone in the van that was parked in back of me on the street.&#160; I went over to him with a packet &amp; gave it to him.&#160; He was talking to a beautiful Muslim lady, a boy around 10 was in the back seat.&#160; She had taken the packet &amp; said&#160;"God bless".&#160; I said "God bless you too".&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">What an evening.&#160; About 7 people took the Truth packets &amp; were witnessed to the Truth on the street &amp; sidewalk.&#160; &#160;I thank the Lord for providing me with these 3 nice men who did such a great job out there.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Bill &amp; I went into the Center &amp; he he did the computer work &amp; we talked about the pro life situation here in Rochester.&#160; Thank you Bill what a trooper.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">We have a new small refrigerator in the center now which was donated by our Board Member Todd.&#160; Thanks Todd, now we can have cold bottled water &amp; other goodies in the Center.&#160; Yeah!!!&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">God is Good - He provides us with what we need.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Martha, Jerry &amp; George were at Planned Parenthood from 1 to 3:45 pm today because Martha couldn't be there the next day.&#160; Most of the day today was covered by pro lifers.&#160; Martha handed out 3 Truth packets &amp; talked with many young people.&#160; Some people&#160;that went into PP &amp;&#160;came out after a very short time, for whatever reason.&#160; It's just so good when they don't spend any time at Rochester's Killing Mill.&#160;&#160; Great job you guys.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>I went over to my stop on the sidewalk &amp; Martha told me that her car was hit in our parking lot where our Center is.&#160; A car backed out &amp; hit her car.&#160; She did take responsibility for it thought Martha did not call the police for the damage was so minimal.&#160; Though this was upsetting to her.&#160; The day was very hot.&#160; Just then Isiah came by, on his bicycle, &amp; said "hi" &amp; a man was walking down the street with a walker &amp; I was calling out to 2 people a&#160; young man &amp; girl who was walking into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Things always happen at once out there.&#160; Martha was helping this man onto our portable chair that we use to put our packets on &amp; pouring a iced tea for both men.&#160; The man using the walker asked me if I was married or had a boyfriend.&#160; I said that this information was not necessary for him to know.&#160; He said "why not" &amp; I left it as it was.&#160; He said that he had fallen a little while ago &amp; was recuperating.&#160; Martha &amp; I wished him well &amp; he was now walking slowly down the street to his destination.</strong>&#160;</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">All of of sudden the young man that had gone in with a young woman came over to sidewalk.&#160; He started to say that his girlfriend was in there because she was having a miscarriage.&#160; <em>I said to him why didn't you take her to the Emergency Room of one of the Hospitals.&#160; He started to say some foul language * put his finger in my face saying that you especially better shut up &amp; on &amp; on.&#160; I finally hollered back not to talk to me that way.&#160; That I knew what a miscarriage was &amp; that I was sorry for the loss of his baby.&#160; I noticed that he had a tattoo of praying hands with a cross on his shoulder &amp; he slapped his shoulder &amp; I can't remember what he said as he walked away.&#160; He went over to the Death Security Guard Doug &amp; spoke with him foe a little bit.&#160; Then Isaiah said that he didn't like how this young man was talking to me &amp; that he was going over to speak to him, which he did.&#160; I was ready for 911.&#160; He came back to Martha &amp; I &amp; said that the young man had calmed down &amp; was sorry.&#160; I had said to Isaiah that he was a Christian &amp; he said that he was going to go over there &amp; speak to the guard for not doing anything.&#160; Now I'm really ready for 911.&#160; He went over to the so-called guard &amp; was talking to him.&#160; I knew that Doug was getting upset because his head was halfway out the window but a little later on I saw them both shake hands &amp; Isaiah came back to us on the sidewalk.&#160; He said that the guard told him that he was Catholic &amp; I told Isaiah that it was in name only because he shouldn't be here working for an abortion mill.&#160; He said that he told him that he should have not let that young</em><em>&#160;man come over to us.&#160; I said that was okay because we do want to talk to the people.&#160; My hero was Isaiah, he proved that here are still good men around &amp; that he was a protector of women.&#160; God bless you Isaiah.&#160;</em></font></strong></p>

<p><font size="4">A woman at the vets across the street hollered at Martha as she was telling the Truth to the girls.&#160; She probably was post-abortive.&#160; How&#160;sad.&#160; A car went into the parking stayed for just a few minutes then left.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; Cleveland, our adopted street person,&#160;stopped by &amp; good hearted Martha fed him. He was happy.&#160;</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">After the noon Mass at Our Lady of Victory Church, Jerry, Charles &amp; Maria &amp; I went to Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was there first &amp; a car was coming out of the parking lot &amp; I hollered that PP kills babies.&#160; The man who was driving with a young woman next to him on the passenger side stopped the truck.&#160; I said to them through the closed window that Planned Parenthood kills babies to which the young woman put up her middle finger to me &amp; he drove hurriedly away.&#160; Then Maria came onto the street to pray the Rosary.&#160; A young woman was walking down the street with young boy in the stroller.&#160; I called her over to us &amp; she had a surprised expression on her face when she saw Malachi, the aborted baby sign. She came right over to Maria &amp; I.&#160; We got talking &amp; I told her that we had brochures about Natural Family Planning at our center which was 2 doors away.&#160; I also said that we had clothes for her son &amp; stuffed animals too.&#160; We walked over to the center together &amp; Maria held down the fort.&#160; The guys showed up now &amp; were praying.&#160; I got to talk with the mom &amp; gave her some very important brochures &amp; contact names to which she replied that she would call &amp; get more information.&#160; She was a very nice woman &amp; she didn't know that Planned Parenthood kills children, she did not like this at all.&#160; She also got information regarding the abortion proprieties of birth control &amp; their side effects.&#160; We walked back outside &amp; she walked down the sidewalk&#160;to go home.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; </font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">When I got back to the sidewalk Maria told me that a City of Rochester van stopped &amp; got a Truth packet &amp; she also had handed out 2 more packets after that.&#160; Praise God.&#160; Maria was only going to stay for a few minutes but God had another plan.&#160; </font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Then the&#160;Thunderbirds&#160;roared as they were practicing for the air show tomorrow.&#160; Most of the PP staff came out to watch &amp; I had a crowd to witness to, even though&#160;most of them have heard the Truth before, we can't give up.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Just then I saw Jame Stewart drove into the parking lot.&#160; I recognized him from my web site.&#160; I hollered over to him to "get out of Rochester" "we don't want you here to kill Rochester's children".&#160; Boy, did he hurry into the building, for someone as old as he is he better not run.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font color="#ff00ff">James Stewart, new killing president &amp; ceo of planned parenthood</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">A mother was bringing her young daughter into the building.&#160; I hollered to the mom saying "why are you bringing your daughter into&#160;this hell hole, they kill babies in there" to which she screamed over to me "I'm bringing her here stupid for birth control".&#160; Who's the stupid one.&#160; I witnessed to them as they were in the building. Yes, we do talk to building too.&#160; </font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">A young girl came out to tell me that Planned Parenthood does other thing than abortions.&#160; Really.&#160; She said for me to "go home"&#160; I couldn't I had to go to the company picnic at Webster park.&#160; I was going to the White House, oh yeah.&#160; She also said that she was against abortion, to which I replied "it doesn't matter what the reason you were here for, even if it was them treating your hang nail, you are supporting what they are doing by using their services.&#160; I said to her that we were suppose to be sisters in this cause but if you are defending PP then your not really pro life.&#160; I also said for her to come to Jesus for He loves her very much.&#160; As I was saying all of this she was walking down the other side of the sidewalk. I had time.&#160; </font></strong></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Some rude people driving down the street.&#160; It's so sad that, mostly were men, acted like animals.&#160; Rick, the</strong> <strong>postman is always a support to us &amp; there were nice people driving down the street too.&#160;&#160;A sweet lady walked down the street &amp; asked for a pink Rosary &amp; that her friend was in jail for a crime she didn't commit.&#160; I said that I would pray for her&#160;&amp;&#160;her friend Mary.&#160; Her name is Sylvia.&#160; She said "thank you ". &#160; We stayed there for 2 hours &amp; gave away&#160; 5 Truth packets.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Then I went to the company picnic &amp; got into it there.&#160; One of the new counselors was wearing an Obama 08 t-shirt &amp; I said to her that he believes in killing kids.&#160; Well the battle begane.&#160; It was like talking to one of the nasty people in front of Planned Parenthood, the same old stuff.&#160; They all say the same things.&#160; How many babies have you adopted.&#160; Give me a break.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="4">When I arrived the 'Lambs of Christ' were praying out the Killing Mill.&#160; Earlier the Black Church on Scio St. came &amp; prayed at the outside wall in front of the abortion mill.&#160; They want to be a part of the '40 Days For Life' in September.&#160; Martha came about 5 minutes after I arrived &amp; we side walked counseled together on the other side of Planned Parenthood.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Our old friend came by who is pregnant with twins, a boy &amp; a girl due in August.&#160; Martha brought her in for more baby clothes &amp; a baby monitor &amp; some stuffed animals.&#160; She was thrilled.&#160; Can't wait to see her babies when they are born.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A young girl came up the sidewalk &amp; Martha &amp; I were talking to her.&#160; She took a Truth packet.&#160; Sylvia Rose, on of the worst death escorts, which they all are bad in what they are doing but she is one of the scariest.&#160; Her body rose straight up as the girl on the sidewalk &amp; we were talking to her.&#160; It was scary.&#160; SR then came over to her car which was parked next to where we were standing &amp; my spirit cringed at her presence.&#160; The young started to walk over to her &amp; by the grace of God I called her away from SR &amp; she came back on the sidewalk &amp; walked down the street.&#160; She had a sad story.&#160; She had a baby, who is now 2 years old, &amp; her boyfriend has custody &amp; she doesn't see her daughter much.&#160; I hope that changes if it is the will of God.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Two young men came into Planned Parenthood &amp; had attitude.&#160; I spoke to them as they were going in &amp; when they came out.&#160; The car stopped at the entrance of the driveway &amp; the guy on the passenger side showed me the Morning After Pill box.&#160; My heart dropped.&#160; Martha &amp; I called them over to talk with us &amp; the one guy said "only if you have some condoms".&#160; They did pull the car over &amp; Martha started to talk to them.&#160; I went over with the baby models to show them but the one said to me that he'd rather talk to her (meaning Martha).&#160; Martha talked with them for a short while.&#160; I felt something on my right hip.&#160; I turned around to see that he had thrown a pencil at me &amp; it hit my right side.&#160; I said to him "I love you" meaning of course in the Christian sense.&#160; Then they drove away.&#160; Martha told me that the guy said that the girl he had sex with last night was ugly &amp; that he didn't want any baby.&#160; Martha talked to them &amp; they took a Truth packet.&#160; Poor girl what happened to her was sort of a rape.&#160; How sad.&#160; He could care less of her &amp; was only using her body for his pleasure.&#160; The caliber of these 2 guys was scary.&#160; No respect for women.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">We stayed until 1:15 PM &amp; then went into the center to do some work &amp; then went to lunch.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I got of the car &amp; stood there on the sidewalk &amp; called out to the girls.&#160; I gave a Truth packet out right away.&#160; Tucker was setting up &amp; Martha wasn't there yet.&#160; About 10 minutes later Martha arrived just when a young woman was leaving Planned Parenthood.&#160; I called over to her &amp; said that we could help her to which she replied that she was pregnant.&#160; I said to her that we had baby clothes at the center 2 doors away &amp; called over to Martha to guide &amp; to help her at the center.&#160; Just then a nice young girl came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walked over to me.&#160; She was looking at the signs &amp; said that it was awful to do that to a baby.&#160; She also said that her mother wanted more children but only had her.&#160; I said to her that she was a blessing from God.&#160; She also said that her girlfriend's friend went to New York to have an abortion when she was 5 months pregnant.&#160; She was mad at her boyfriend &amp; wanted to get back at him.&#160; How horrible.&#160; This was upsetting to the both of us.&#160; Her ride came, it looked like it was&#160; mother &amp; a young boy sitting in the back seat, he was her son.&#160; He looked around 5 or 6 &amp; was as cute as could be.&#160; She said that she wanted more children.&#160; She had taken a packet earlier on, I know that she will share the information with others.&#160; She was a blessing to me.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Martha &amp; we standing on the sidewalk when a man on a bicycle stopped by to talk with us.&#160; It was an interesting encounter.&#160; He was going in many directions with his conversion with us.&#160; I know for sure that he did not like abortion &amp; he looked intently at the graphic signs.&#160; He appeared a little shaken.&#160; He said that it takes a man to make a baby which we told him that we knew.&#160; Then he said to me "did you see the movie The Gremlins"&#160; to which I replied that I had not.&#160; He replied for me "not to water the mugwoa"?&#160; I just smiled at him &amp; said that I will not &amp;&#160;he rode sweetly&#160;away.&#160; He was a gentle &amp; pure&#160;soul.&#160; I feel that he has gone through a lot in his lifetime.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another encounter a little while later with a man on a bicycle.&#160; He apologized for having had a few drinks earlier.&#160; We jut told him to be careful while riding the bike.&#160; He mad a lot of sense in what he was talking about.&#160; He had his head on straight.&#160; He keep repeating the Commandment of God "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160; We agreed.&#160; He was a pleasant man &amp; we hope to see him again.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Sweet Sonia drove by &amp; said out of her car &amp; she was driving down the street "thank you &amp; blessings to you".&#160; We hollered back to her "the same to you".&#160; She is breath of fresh air.&#160; Thank God for Sonia &amp; her constant support of the ministry.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Martha &amp; I went back into the center to put together more Truth packets for another time for the people in need.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Martha's team is growing!!!&#160; Praise God!!!&#160; She had 4 men &amp; herself to witness out on the front lines the Truth.&#160; It is always difficult &amp; she gives all she has in witnessing.&#160; There were good responses &amp; also the bad ones too.&#160; They pray &amp; talk to the girls.&#160; This so good for her to be out there during the day hours when Planned Parenthood is murdering little defenseless babies &amp; ruining their mothers lives &amp; the fathers lives too.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When I arrived for the second shift, I was later than usual because I had to stop to get water for the center &amp; baby clothes for the center &amp; something was going on on Main St. because it was barred off.&#160; Some cars &amp; I went down this narrow street &amp; we couldn't get out.&#160; Most of the cars had to back out or make a 3 point turn.&#160; I told the officer who was in the middle, of the side street, to please make sure we all get out alright. Well when I got to the front lines, nicely stressed already, I was told that the woman who was speaking to the Death Escort was a Christian.&#160; Here we go again.&#160; Like at work, there are pro-abortion women who profess to be Christ followers &amp; to know Christ &amp; to love Christ.&#160; I have never before run into so many that say that they are Christians, Catholics alike because we ARE Christians, that believe that it is OK with Christ to have His creation which are His babies murdered in Cold-Blood.&#160; Go figure!!! So I called over to her with words of Truth.&#160; She left the grounds &amp; I hope that she does not come back to this Baby Killing, Racist horrible place of innocent death.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;I was told that Aggie, a pro lifer, had stopped earlier to give the Focus Pregnany Help Center, some new baby clothes.&#160; Oh How the Good Lord provides for our clients.&#160; He knows &amp; puts upon the hearts of others to give us what we need when we need it.&#160; He is amazing &amp; we thank you dear &amp; all powerful &amp; loving Lord for your goodness.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Eight&#160;pro lifers were on the sidewalk this Saturday morning to wittiness the Truth &amp; to help others to not to have their babies murdered by Planned Parenthood.&#160; Many Truth packets went out to the girls.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;Martha &amp; I were on the sidewalk when a van had stopped by us &amp; asked what parish we belonged to.&#160; He said tat he goes to Our Lady of Victory church for the Mass at 12:10 PM &amp; he belongs to St. Anne's parish.&#160; We told him of the '40 Days For Life'&#160; &amp; he said that he listens to EWAN &amp; knew about it .&#160; We told him &amp; his wife that we were going to have the event here in Rochester in September.&#160; They were delighted &amp; we both exchanged e-mail addresses.&#160; I told them about the meetings on Monday at the center &amp; they seemed interested.&#160; Praise God!&#160; The word is spreading like wild fire through the power of the Holy Spirit.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A young couple, a&#160;girl &amp; a&#160;guy drove into Planned Parenthood.&#160; The man stayed in the car &amp; the young girl went in.&#160; We witnessed the Truth to them both.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;A woman &amp; a young boy around 7 years old went in.&#160; She was there for a long time which we suspected the Depo shot.&#160; When they finally came out I asked her if she had the shot &amp; she said "yes".&#160; She did take a Truth&#160;packet &amp; I told her that the Depo shot causes early abortions.&#160;She looked at me funny,&#160; like she couldn't believe it.&#160; It's hard to believe but it is true.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another woman said to me that "they do other things other than abortions here".&#160;&#160;Like that&#160;makes a difference.&#160; Don't people know that when you say "abortion" you are really saying "the slaughter of an innocent human being in the womb of the mother".&#160; Get it straight.&#160; Like Tucker once said to someone who had said the same thing "just because a mass murder does a couple of good things he is STILL a Mass Murder".&#160; Don't base Planned Parenthood on Pap Smears &amp; Pelvic Exams as being a good place.&#160; That's how they get you in there!!!&#160; Tey deceive &amp; you are their Victims.</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;It started to thunder &amp; lightening, I thought for a minute that I was in Florida, because lightening was so commom an occurrence every day.&#160; You just learned to duck.&#160;&#160; We just had time to put everything away in the center when it poured down cats &amp; dogs.&#160; Thnak you Lord.&#160; I really didn't want to&#160;hear&#160;Martha say how refeshing the rain was when I usually end up soaked.&#160;&#160; We went into the center to do some work then left.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I went into Wegmans, the one in Pittsford where I see all the PP Death people.&#160;&#160;Today was no exception.&#160; While I was in the Produce Dept. I saw walking slowly down the aisle&#160;the oldest of the Death Escorts.&#160; He's the one who put a sign on his car window that read "I am a pro-choice father of an adopted daughter".&#160; Interesting.&#160; Well, I went up to him &amp; stood there in front of him, real close &amp; said "you will see these babies someday that you helped to kill at Planned Parenthood".&#160; He didn't recognize me because we are so far away on the sidewalk but after I said that to him he knew who I was.&#160; He looked at me to say "you are crazy" &amp; walked hurriedly away for an old man.&#160; Wait when he dies, if I wasn't right through the power of the Holy Spirit.&#160; It was like the Holy Spirit was still giving him a chance to repent.&#160; Lets hope &amp; pray that he will for there are 'no atheist in fox holes'.&#160; And when he does see these babies someday &amp; he&#160;had already repented it will go well for him.&#160; If not, it will not go well for him or others who have or have helped to murder God's innocent children.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I went back to the center after Mass this evening.&#160; It was around 6 PM&#160;&amp; when I was coming out of our parking lot I saw up the street that a white car with some people in it was pulling out of the closed&#160;Planned Parenthood's parking lot.&#160; I hollered out that "Planned Parenthood kills babies" to which I received the middle finger of the man driving.&#160; I was now in back of the car waiting for the light at Chestnut when I got a piece of paper &amp; wrote their Florida license plate # down.&#160; They were turning onto Franklin when I passed them &amp; hollered out to them&#160;"repent" to which I received my second finger from the gentleman driving.&#160; Can't wait for the '40Fays For Life' this way there will be people out there in front of Planned Parenthood when these things happen.&#160; We will get more of an handle of what Planned Parenthood is doing.&#160;</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Wednesday, August 6, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="4">Tucker &amp; I were the only pro lifers there tonight.&#160; Martha was on a short vacation, which was well deserved.&#160; When I arrived at the Killing Mill &amp; got out of the car I handed out a Truth Packet to a young girl who was just pulling out of the driveway.&#160;She got out of her car to come to me. &#160;We talked for a few minutes.&#160; She just had the Depo shot &amp; I told her about it briefly &amp; also told her that we had information in the packet that she just took also.&#160; She was not married so I told her to save herself for her husband &amp; she smiled &amp; said "thank you" &amp; got back into her car &amp; waved as she drove passed me.&#160; Thank you Jesus.&#160;</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size="4">A young guy screamed at me as he was pulling out of the parking lot &amp; told me put "that sign away, I don't want my girlfriend to see it, you hear me".&#160; I thought he was getting out of his car to do me harm or my sign of Malachi that I was holding but by the grace of God he didn't.&#160; I let Tucker know that there might be trouble.&#160; He reversed the car back into the Planned Parenthood parking lot &amp; parked.&#160; I thought that he was calling the police, the notion crossed my mind.&#160; I didn't have much time to think about it when 2 young girls were coming down the street heading to Planned Parenthood.&#160; I called to them to come over to me, which they did.&#160; I was handing them a Truth packet when I asked them if they were going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; They said 'yes' they were going there for a pregnancy test.&#160; I told them that I can take them to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center 2 doors down for a pregnancy test.&#160; They said "okay" &amp; we walked to the center.&#160; The one girl took a pregnancy test &amp; was given the help that she &amp; her pregnant sister needed for "Life".&#160; They went home happy.&#160; They thanked me &amp; I thanked them for being girls that respected life. &#160;I also said that I wanted to see their babies when they are born.&#160; They said 'yes".&#160; I gave them Project Rachel brouchures for their friends that had their babies killed at Planned Parenthood.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">When, I returned to the sidewalk from being in the center with our 2 clients, the young guy I had an altercation with earlier was coming out with his girlfriend.&#160; 'Oh boy' I said to myself.&#160; I then made Tucker aware so he could call 911 if he had to.&#160; But the dear Lord had calmed him down &amp; I said to them both "that Jesus loves them".&#160; He tilted his head as if to agree&#160;&amp; went out of the parking lot without incident.&#160; Thank you our loving &amp; all-powerful Lord that changes hearts.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A young couple came out of the parking lot &amp; stopped to receive a Truth packet.&#160; The young man, on the passenger side,&#160;smiled &amp; said "thank you: after I gave him a black Rosary.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A&#160;gentleman approached me on the sidewalk &amp; started to ask me questions.&#160; I answered him &amp; then referred him to Tucker for more answers.&#160; Man to man.&#160; I had to get back calling out to the girls going into the Killing Mill.&#160;</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size="4">There is one person,&#160;probably&#160;fairly new,&#160;who works at PP always reacts to what I say to her, when she drives out of the parking lot, which is unheard of.&#160; There is HOPE.</font></p>

Rona was on the other side by herself on the mega phone witnessing to the girls going into Planned Parenthood &amp; the 2 Death Escorts who were by the doors.&#160; She was on fire through the power of the Holy Spirit with the Truth.&#160; There were pro lifers across the street, which is effective.&#160; Jim &amp; Sue Bovey, the pro death neighbors who live right across from the Killing Mill,&#160;were outside doing their garden work, they even looked that they were a part of the prayerful pro lifer protesters.&#160; Thanks Jim &amp; Sue for adding to the numbers.&#160; The people driving bye were at times quite rude today with the usual "get a job" &amp; why are they not working?&#160; Also a favorite of mine is when they holler out "get a life" to which Rona replied "we are trying to get many lives"&#160; You go girl!!&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Kathy C. was on the other side of the street holding her sign which reads 'I Regret My Abortion'.&#160; She had the opportunity of helping a young girl who was walking down the street.&#160; Amen sister.</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size="4">And know along comes Kathy Lynch with her poor&#160;2 poor dogs, imagine having her as a mother.&#160; She was walking passed us to which one of poor dogs took a leak right on our&#160;signs that we have on the sidewalk as a witness.&#160; I called out to her that she was sick &amp; that I was going to call the police.&#160; She couldn't hear me because she has her&#160;radio in&#160;her ears. When her poor dog had peed she just smirked as if to say "good dogie, a special treat for you when&#160;we get home".&#160; &#160; Arf Arf.&#160; Well, I said to the dear Lord "if you want me to report this incident then please let a police car come down the street for me to flag down.&#160; So I did when about 10 minutes later a police car had come down the street &amp; they stopped.&#160; I told the 2 officers what had happened &amp; they agreed that it was not right.&#160; Rona was busy telling them not to vote for Obama, again you go girl!!&#160; Officer Smith said that he would take care of this issue.&#160; I gave them her name &amp; where she lived, I'm sure that what he said he would do he will do.&#160;&#160;I know that&#160;an officer will&#160;to go to her home &amp; talk to her about the incident.&#160; These babies have already suffered in death &amp; their pictures should &amp; will be respected.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Scott who is visually impaired was waiting for the cab to pick him up.&#160; The cab did come &amp; parked at the Buckpitt's entrance.&#160; The woman cab driver got out to help Scott into the car.&#160; Rona said to her that Obama was not the candidate to vote for &amp; the cab driver called back to her saying that she&#160;wasn't going to vote for him.&#160; Amen sister.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">So know we know that at least 3 people&#160;, on the&#160;street, are not going to vote for this Monster that&#160;votes for the killing of innocent children.&#160; Sicko!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A ploitical&#160;car drove by me that was endorsing Rick Dollinger to which I hollered to them "no way".&#160; David Gantt&#160;has endorsed Dollinger. Another&#160;twosome that believe in killing kids.&#160; Sickos!!!&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&#160;So much went on tonight,&#160;I will have to write the happenings of the evening in the next couple of days.&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&#160;We handed out 12 Truth packets with 45 inserts of infomation per packet which is 540 pieces of Truth went out into the minds, hearts &amp; homes of 12 people.&#160; Many Rosaries went out also for people to grow closer to Jesus through Mother Mary.&#160; Baby clothes were handed out to 2 young mothers &amp; only 2 people wanted to kill me tonight.&#160;&#160; It was a blessed &amp; unbelieveable evening.&#160; Thank you Lord &amp; Mother Mary.&#160; Amen.&#160;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">I got out of my car &amp; went over to the sidewalk within minutes I had handed out a Truth packet.&#160; I was waiting for Martha to come but she came later, then it was Tucker, Martha &amp; I.&#160; Martha handed out baby clothes to two moms from the center, they were happy.&#160; Two women who had just dropped off a young girl took 2 packets.&#160; We handed out many packets &amp; Rosaries tonight.&#160; Come Holy Spirit come.&#160; One young man down the street &amp; looked at the graphic pictures with such sadness in his eyes.&#160; I spoke to him &amp; showed our Growth &amp; Development fetal models of the 7 to 10 week old baby in the womb.&#160; He was awe struck.&#160; You, young man&#160;are our future.&#160; He walked down the street still looking at the signs.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>A father &amp; his 2 young sons were biking down the street &amp; one of his young sons hollered out as he passed by "what happened to the baby"?&#160; Good question young boy.&#160; I&#160;hope that your father will tell you soon about what you saw tonight.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Cleveland came by &amp; Martha went into the center &amp; warmed him up a container of Chinese noodles &amp; an orange drink.&#160; He was happy but he'd rather have money.&#160;</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Hip Teen girls came out &amp; we gave them a Truth packet &amp; talked with the new girls that got caught up in this horrible program.&#160; I hope that they won't come back.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">A man was going into Planned Parenthood &amp; I called over to him saying that PP kills babies.&#160; He hollered something to me that I cannot put on the page.&#160; He was picking up his mother who works at the Killing Mill.&#160; He drove out real fast after she got into the car, angry as all get out.&#160; His car was curving a little bit towards us so I went for his license plate number.&#160; He gave me his middle finger as he drove passed me &amp; if looks could kill, I'd be dead.</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">A young couple went in &amp; later came out.&#160; Martha called to them but they got into the car &amp; as they were driving out they both gave us the finger, she gave us 2 &amp; screamed that the picture of the aborted baby was ..........&#160; I hope that she will find forgiveness &amp; healing from the dear Lord soon.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">As the Death security, Mark&#160;was leaving I&#160;told&#160;him that he was on the wrong road that his road was wide &amp; was leading to Hell, if he didn't repent.&#160; He screamed out of the van that it was I that was making the girls go into Planned Parenthood.&#160; He says this all the time I just wish that he would get new material, this is boring.&#160; He also said that he was praying for me to which I replied that I did not want him to pray for me because he was praying to the devil.&#160; I also told him that he was deceived.&#160; Working at a place that murders God's children &amp; professing to be a Christian.&#160; What a lie!!&#160; What a reaction I got from him!!!!</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I said the Rosary &amp; then&#160;went back into the center to sort out baby clothes &amp; to put together 10 more Truth packets for another day at the Planned Parenthood Klling Mill.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha, Bill, Charles &amp; Jerry were out in front of the Killing Mill witnessing to Life.&#160; They were praying the Rosary &amp; Cleveland come by, wanting money of course, but the team would not give him his warmed noodles until they were finished with the powerful Rosary prayer.&#160; Cleveland was handed a Rosary &amp; was invited to join in.&#160; The sight must have been awesome with all praying to the Mother of God as intercessor to close Planned Parenthood down &amp; to save lives &amp; souls for her Son Jesus.&#160; When the Gospel prayer was finished Cleveland was fed a nice warm lunch compliments of sweet Martha.</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp; young girl stopped to speak to Martha.&#160; She told her that her girlfriend had an abortion last week &amp; she had wished that Martha was there.&#160; Martha was not there but her girlfriend should not have had her baby killed by abortion.&#160; It is written in our hearts "Thou Shall Not Kill" let alone your own flesh &amp; blood, your baby.&#160; She was nice to Martha &amp; wanted her to call her &amp; to keep in touch with her.&#160; She was at Planned Parenthood for Rape Counseling.&#160; How sad that she was raped &amp; is here trying to get healed.&#160; She took a Truth packet with Compass Care referral number for rape survivors in it.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha saw an elderly woman who was walking across the street &amp; asked her if she would want a prayer Rosary.&#160; She crossed the street &amp; came over to Martha.&#160; This is Her Story.&#160; She told Martha to keep up doing this work then she preceded to tell her sad story.&#160; She said that when she was a teenager 55 years ago she became pregnant.&#160; I don't know how she ended up at the mayo Clinic but she said this is where they did an abortion which they blotched.&#160; After that she could never conceive again, she had no children on earth but certainly one in Heaven, which I hope that she doesn't forget.&#160; She started to cry &amp; said that that abortion ruined her life.&#160; She took a Rosary &amp; said that she had to get home for she lived down the side street across from Planned Parenthood.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I went back on the sidewalk &amp; Carol Love was leaving the Killing Mill's parking lot. &#160;I said to her that " I won't miss seeing your face any longer" to which she grinned,&#160;for she is supposingly leaving in September when old&#160;man James Stewart is taking over&#160;at the Death Mill as president &amp; ceo.&#160;&#160; How sad!!!&#160;&#160; Remember we don't hate you just what you are doing in the mass murdering of little children.&#160; Don't ever be proud of&#160;what you have done here at Planned Parenthood over&#160;your many years.&#160; You are just as bad as Hitler&#160;&amp; so is James Stewart &amp; any other abortionist or president &amp; ceo of any Death Mill,&#160;for you have tortured &amp; murdered millions of&#160;voiceless, defendless, innocent&#160;people.&#160; Don't be fooled, there is a Hell.&#160; We hope that you all REPENT</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">The minute I arrived on the sidewalk, which had no one there on the Buckpitt side, the rest of the team was on the other side I encountered trouble.&#160; A man from across the street came over to me &amp; said "I would like to ask you a question because you are a woman"&#160; I said "okay".&#160; Well after that I really can't remember much.&#160; He just screamed at me &amp; used foul words.&#160; The pro lifer, who was with The Lambs of Christ &amp; was praying with them, came over to my side of the sidewalk.&#160; When he arrived he asked the man if he could give him some information to which he replied "shut the _____ up, as a spray of spit hit the pro lifers face.&#160; We know what Jesus felt (just a little bit).&#160; I then took out my cell phone &amp; told him that I was going to call the police &amp; he called me every name in the book &amp; left, talking loudly all the way down the street, even pass the Lambs of Christ.&#160; The poor soul had many problems to which we will pray for him.&#160; The pro lifer said to me "welcome to the sidewalk &amp; then left me &amp; went back to pray with the others.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">When I arrived there was Martha, Maria, Rob, Bill &amp; Bob.&#160; I went over to talk with Maria, who was on the other side right in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She was witnessing the Truth.&#160; We shared &amp; I went back over to the other side when I saw Martha talking to car that had stopped right beside Martha.&#160; There were 2 women in the front seat &amp; 3 small children in the back seat.&#160; Martha had already given them Truth packets.&#160; I went over &amp; offered them some children clothes , stuffed animals &amp; books.&#160; They were delighted.&#160; They followed me over, by car, to the center.&#160; The driver got out &amp; she picked out a couple of cute stuffed animals.&#160; I told her that I had children books in the center, she followed me in.&#160; She picked out some books &amp; I went on about if a girl is pregnant she should have her baby.&#160; Then the bad news came.&#160; She turned to me &amp; told me that she had had an abortion at Planned Parenthood November 15, 2007 &amp; she realizes now that she had her baby killed.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; She said that she was tired during her 8 weeks &amp; she had things to do with her life, so she had an abortion.&#160; I told her that the baby came first &amp; the tiredness would pass &amp; there is never a reason to have an abortion.&#160; She agreed.&#160; I walked her over to the Growth &amp; Development chart &amp; read about the baby at 8 weeks.&#160; She said that the baby starts to 'suck it's thumb'.&#160; I said to her that did she as the Lord to forgive her &amp; she said 'yes'.&#160; That is good.&#160; I then said to her to ask the Lord if the baby was a boy or girl &amp; they she said "she" I then said that the Lord revealed that to her &amp; to name her baby to give the baby dignity.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; I asked about the father &amp; she said that he left it up to her &amp; went with her to Planned Parenthood for the abortion.&#160; How sad.&#160; I gave her more literature regarding what we were talking about, that are not in the Truth packet.&#160; I asked her her name &amp; gave her a hug as she left the center to go back to the car.&#160; I asked if the children were buckled up in the back seat., she said the one trys to get out all the time.&#160;I'm not sure if they were her children or her friends that was with her.&#160;I said&#160;'good bye &amp; God bless'.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Planned Parenthood's 2007 Annual Report stated that they did 3,351 abortions &amp; one of them was this lady's little girl.&#160; How horrible.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">A car had stopped to talk with Martha &amp; I , the rest of the team had already left, &amp; he asked if the graphic signs were effective, he didn't seen think that they were.&#160; Martha &amp; I quickly changed his mind.&#160; We told him that babies lives have been saved because of the graphic signs &amp; he asked how did we know &amp; we told him that the woman or family member had told us that.&#160; He then said that even if one baby was saved then it is a good thing.&#160; One thing lead to another &amp; we told him of the '40 Days for Life Campaign' he said "I can do that".&#160; Martha hurried to her car to get the fliers to give to him.&#160; We found out that he was Catholic &amp; goes to St. Margaret Mary's Parish.&#160; We asked if he could put up the fliers there in the Church&#160;&amp; he said he would.&#160; Wow, what an encounter. Praise God!!&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Mostly woman gave me the 'bird' today &amp; all I say to my broken heart is that these are the woman who probably have had an abortion &amp; have not dealt with it yet.&#160; I'll keep them in my heart &amp; pray for their conversion, salvation &amp; repentance.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">The neighbor Kathy who walks her 2 dogs that sometimes pee on our signs that are on the sidewalk, well&#160;her &#160;&amp; her dogs walked down the street &amp; I followed along side of her.&#160; This time she said nothing to me, there was no confrontation.&#160;&#160;&#160;There is HOPE.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">A young man was walking&#160;down the other side of the sidewalk &amp; he was listening to music with his ear plugs in.&#160; I took a chance &amp; hollered over to him asking&#160;if he would like a Rosary.&#160; He continued to walk down the street then all of a sudden he crossed over to us &amp; said "I have a question to ask"&#160; The question is usually the same question "what if the woman was raped would abortion okay then".&#160; I had to answer that question now from a personal point of view&#160;.&#160; I said that I was conceived from rape &amp; are you saying that I should not be here?? I looked him right in the eyes.&#160; He answered "well no" then he said" what if the child constantly reminds the woman of the rapist".&#160; To which Martha &amp; I replied "that you don't murder the child for the crime of the father'.&#160; "It wasn't the babies fault that the mother was raped".&#160; I told him that the woman can, in time get over, but not ever completely, the rape but if she had an abortion she will never really get over it.&#160; A woman was never meant to kill her child it isn't normal.&#160; A mother should always protects her child &amp; gives life, not takes life of her child. &#160;He agreed &amp; said "I don't believe in abortion &amp; I know that it is wrong"&#160; Finally the response I was hoping for.&#160; He did seem to think it was a woman's choice though which I said "our free will is not free if we make an evil choice then we are in bondage". Then he said that his sister had 4 abortions.&#160; Now I know why he said what he said.&#160; I asked if she had asked&#160;Jesus to forgive her &amp; he said that he wasn't sure.&#160;I said that&#160;she needs to. He said that she has had 3 other children &amp; goes to church &amp; I said that "she has 7 children for 4 are in Heaven".&#160;&#160;He looked at the graphic picture of Malachi &amp; the other aborted babies &amp; his eyes welled up for he was touched by their suffering.&#160; He didn't want a Truth packet or a Rosary or even a Project Rachel brochure (post abortion) but as he left &amp; I was sure that he was touched by the Master's Hand.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">A mother &amp; her daughter was walking on the other side of the street &amp; had gone to the vets with their dog.&#160; I crossed the street to give then a Truth packet &amp; the young girl thanked me with such a sweet face.&#160; As I was walking back to the other side of the street &amp; hear the mother holler to Martha &amp; I "thank you".&#160; We called back to her "God bless".&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">A young man, on a bicycle, stopped to talk to Martha &amp; I.&#160; He said "now don't holler at me I need both ears".&#160; I said "I don't think that's the case".&#160; He asked some political questions &amp; we answered to the best of our ability.&#160; I offered him a Truth packet &amp; he said that he didn't have a place to put it so I gave him a picture of the Blessed Mother &amp; he exclaimed how beautiful she was.&#160; He said I'll have to put her in my back pocket &amp; I said that would be fine, she won't mind.&#160; After a few more minutes of conservation he rode away.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I went to lunch after I threw out in the dumpster about 300 +&#160;<font style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Rochester Healthy Living</font> magazines, that I take out of Wegmans &amp; Tops or any other place that I can find them at, &amp; put them in my car &amp; later throw them out in any dumpster that I can find.&#160; They still advertise for Planned Parenthood &amp; the&#160;pre mediated murder of innocent, voiceless American children by abortion &amp; birth control.&#160;I have written to the editor of this horrible magazine &amp; spoke with him on the phone &amp; even sent him brochures of this evil organization,&#160;to no avail.&#160; These magazines are dangerous &amp; if a vulnerable girl or woman picks this magazine up&#160;&amp; is abortion minded &amp; sees the advertisement of Planned Parenthood promoting abortion &amp; birth control then a baby might die.&#160;&#160;These magazines are FREE &amp; are at the free magazine racks in the stores.&#160; &#160;They are promoting the killing of children.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="4" color="#0000ff"><strong>Wednesday, September 10, 2008 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Tucker &amp; I were there tonight.&#160; Martha had a nursing class to go to.&#160; When I got there 3 young girls came over to me &amp; they each took a Truth packet &amp; the little 10 week old baby with&#160;the Growth &amp; Development chart on the card, they each took 2.&#160; One of the girls told me that Planned Parenthood told her when she was 5 months&#160;pregnant &amp; felt her baby kick inside her that she still could have an abortion.&#160; Imagine that! &#160;Planned Parenthood even wants to kill your baby even if you don't want your baby killed.&#160; Her son is now 3 years old.&#160; Thank God she didn't give in to their deception &amp; lies &amp; murdering.&#160; &#160;One of the girls took the mega phone &amp; hollered into it "murders".&#160; So right sh is.</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Tucker was on the phone calling into the Catholic Radio Station letting the listeners know that Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, that he was going to be in Rochester on Friday &amp; Saturday at the Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; I was on the street &amp; another 3 girls were walking down the street with a 1 year old boy sleeping in the stroller.&#160;&#160;Each young girl&#160;took a Truth packet &amp; I gave the mom a couple of stuffed animals, for her son.&#160; All the girls were very happy &amp; so will the little boy when he wakes up.&#160; God bless you all.&#160; Thank you for giving "life' to your son rather than 'death' through abortion mom.&#160; &#160;Stay chaste now until you get married.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Another Truth packet went out to a receptive&#160;person who wanted the to know the Truth.&#160; Tucker now had to leave &amp; Jose took his place for the next hour until they close at 7PM.&#160; I called out to girls &amp; gave them some information verbally to try to help them.&#160; Jose &amp; I talked about the '40 Days For Life Campaign' which is coming up quickly.&#160; I shared with him other things &amp; I thank him for a 'listening&#160;ear &amp; no judging' of my life experiences.&#160; It was healing &amp; soothing to my soul.&#160; &#160;Maybe more listening &amp; love&#160;would be good for us all.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Jose helped me&#160;bring the signs&#160;to the outside of the center for he had to leave for a talk regarding the '40 Days For Life Campaign'.&#160; As I was putting the signs into the center I saw David Gantt &amp; a woman standing by a car near the Ethiopian Restaurant, which he's always at, which is 2&#160;doors down from the center, his office is in the same&#160;strip mall is ours.&#160; I mentioned to him that the '40 Days For Life" was coming soon &amp; he then said "G........... why do you talk to me, stop talking to me, I don't care".&#160; I replied&#160;"that you maybe don't care but the&#160;babies that are being killed at Planned Parenthood do &amp; you do nothing to help save their lives".&#160; Then I went&#160;into the center to put some of the sign away &amp; then came out to put some more signs away.&#160; When I came back outside Gantt said to me " now why don't you just admit your abortion &amp; deal with it, you know that you had an abortion, as he was puffing away at his cigar.&#160; I replied "I wouldn't do that to my baby &amp; I could sue you for slander, prove it".&#160; He hurried back into the restaurant with the silent black woman who is my witness.&#160; I guess you can't talk to this ANGRY&#160; Assemblyman, who is suppose to represent the people.&#160; Right.&#160; I think that you should go for Anger Management classes or quit politics or not get elected again or take a vacation&#160;or get more rest &amp; a better perceptive of the things that are important in our community, which is the 'right to be born, as American citizens &amp; to be protected from&#160;the Abortionist hand'.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p align="center">&#160;<font size="4"><strong> Please&#160;REPENT Mr. Gantt&#160;!!</strong></font></p>
