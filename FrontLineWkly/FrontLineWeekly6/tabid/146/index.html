<p>&#160;<strong><font size="4">It was good to see Becki, from Elim Bible Institute again.&#160; She was ill &amp; couldn't make it last Wednesday at the center.&#160; Both her &amp; Amber showed up to do work at the center tonight.&#160; How great!!&#160; I keep them busy.&#160; I had put donations on the shelf in the Material Aid room earlier so it was ready to service our clients.&#160; Tucker&#160;arrived&#160; so I didn't want him to be by himself on the street, so when I could get away I went to the sidewalk to be with him.&#160; I engaged some people which is always a challenge.&#160; The Rape counselors were driving into Planned Parenthood for their meeting.&#160; One car ad advertisement that she was working for a cleaning company.&#160; I sent the main office some information about Planned Parenthood &amp; how they DON'T report statuary rapes, thought hey have a Rape Counseling services at the main abortion center at 114 University Ave.&#160; How warped &amp; sick.&#160; What hiprocrates!!&#160; Hope that her boss tells her to keep her &amp;&#160;the company car away from Planned Parenthood now since she knows the truth about this evil organization that murders people.&#160; We'll see.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">People walking down the street are offered Rosaries &amp; are blessed when they take them.&#160; The smiles on their faces are so heart warming.&#160; Mother Mary please draw these people to your Son Jesus.&#160; Thank you dear Mother.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">A car stopped by the sidewalk &amp; he said to me "are you going to take care of these children".&#160; I said "yes, sir you don't kill children. Adoption is the answer NOT abortion &amp; I think that God is not happy with your question".&#160; He made a face &amp; drove away.&#160; Oh yea these sick people think that you should murder these children so they won't be a bother to society or their families.&#160; How sick!!!&#160; Poor man I do hope that he repents soon!&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Lots of positive honking of horns to our favor tonight.&#160; It's about time.&#160; Most of the country is Pro Life now, again what took so long people.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong><font size="4">The girls in the center worked very hard tonight &amp; left at 6PM.&#160; Mary K. came to help me in the Material Aid room, we were blessed with many great items &amp; clothes.&#160; The room is becoming to small for all that we have in the room for mother's children.&#160; We have all sizes of children clothes from infant to size 7, shoes, blankets, toys, books, lamps, stuffed animals, winter clothes &amp; jackets, formula, diapers, blankets etc.&#160; Thank you everyone for your generous support to the center &amp; to the Material Aid room so that we can completely assist our clients &amp; their families.&#160; Mary spent time with her darling daughter to help me put things away &amp; to oragnize the room some more.&#160; Thanks girls.&#160; It was a productive time on the street &amp; at the center.&#160; Praise God for all your help to us.</font></strong>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;<strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I got to the center &amp; frontlines after Mass today.&#160; Mike, Winnie &amp; Joan meet us there at the center.&#160; They brought some baby clothes &amp; non- perishable foods for our food shelves.&#160; Also Celeste came later to drop off some food for our shelves, thanks everyone!&#160; Suzanne, our Thursday counselor was not able to come today, so Martha &amp; I will have to man the center &amp; street today.&#160; I do appreciate all your efforts&#160;in helping&#160;our clients, Suzanne, as our Thursday counselor.&#160; I went out to the frontlines &amp; started to counsel.&#160; They were killing little babies today.&#160; A young girl came out of Planned Parenthood with a brown bag, which is birth control, they give after an abortion, &amp; was being picked up by a Taxi, which is not a good sign.&#160; Then cars came flooding into the parking lot.&#160; Usually there were cars with a girl &amp; a guy in it.&#160; One of the guys was waving at me, as&#160;he &amp; his girlfriend were going into Planned Parenthood, after I offered them help&#160;&amp; later on, when he drove out, probably to Wendy's, he blew me a kiss.&#160; How sick!&#160; He brought his girlfriend into Planned Parenthood to kill their child &amp; he blows me a kiss.&#160; What a sick person.&#160; Us being out there probably made him uncomfortable, yea!!&#160; Sometimes I feel that I'm in an horror movie or having a nightmare,&#160;that I&#160;can't wake up from.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">We had a mother of twins come in for the high chair &amp; she dropped off some baby clothes &amp; diapers for the center.&#160; Nice switch.&#160; As we helped her out she helped us out.&#160; Martha stayed to help another client in the center with a pregnancy test.&#160; Mike who was with me on the street along with his wife &amp; their friend spotted that the condo, across the street, was up For Sale.&#160; I asked him to call to see how much they were asking.&#160; He did &amp; then told me that they were asking $200,039.00 for the place.&#160; In your dreams people, right across the street from Planned Parenthood the Killing Mill.&#160; Some poor sucker probably will buy it, I sure hope who ever does buy&#160;the condo&#160;are nice &amp; not mean like the other 2</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;condo residents.&#160; Or, Oh Boy, here we go again.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha was still in the center &amp; I was out on the sidewalk when I hollered over to 2 young people, a black young man &amp; a white young lady.&#160; He gave me indication that he was not receptive to the information that I was offering him but a few minutes later he walked over to me.&#160; Carol had now arrived &amp; was in back of me.&#160; She came along side of me when this young man approached me.&#160; I told him that PP was racist.&#160; Then Carol said that she has a Black grandchild &amp; I said that I have a great niece &amp; nephew that are Black.&#160; Then he became defensive.&#160; He said "why are you telling me that I'm not Black".&#160; Okay, denounce your Race, which is crazy.&#160; I offered him the Maafa 21: Black Genocide in the&#160;21st. century&#160;DVD &amp; he refused it.&#160; He then said that his Aunty is the Vice President of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Oh boy!&#160; Another Black person&#160;helping to kill off the Black race.&#160; I grew concerned, so I offered him the DVD once again.&#160; He reached over &amp; took it from me, which I was glad, but only for a moment, for he broke it in two &amp; threw it on the sidewalk.&#160; Violence on the street!&#160; I said thanks for nothing &amp; he walked over to be with his white friend.&#160; Just then a Taxi cab drove up to pick them up, so I took my cell phone out of my pocket &amp; pretended to call 911, by not pressing any buttons.&#160; I looked to see the license number of the cab &amp; pretended to write it down on the paper,&#160;just to scare him a little, but this&#160;probably wouldn't scare this guy, he wasn't afraid of little oh me.&#160;&#160;Can't blame me for trying after he destroyed my property.&#160; I was a bit ticked off.&#160; If you didn't want it then just don't take, that's OK with me.&#160; I&#160;offered it to him twice to many times.&#160; Why can't&#160;you be happy with how God made you, Black or White, we were ALL created by God &amp; will go back to God someday.&#160; Let's all just get along while were here on Earth together!!!&#160; What a better world it would be.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Tuesday, Nov. 17, 2009 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p>
<div><strong><font size="4">Martha wasn't going to be on the front lines today, which I knew in advance.&#160; I really depend on her so much to help out in the center &amp; to be a sidewalk counselor on the frontlines.&#160; She is such a blessing to me.&#160; The pro life team, who has been out there for the past 14 years, in all kinds of weather &amp; situations are also a blessing.&#160; The dedication of the team to pray &amp; to witness against the evils Planned Parenthood is rare&#160;most cities.&#160; What a blessing to Rochester&#160;are these fantastic people.&#160; You know who you are.&#160; God bless you all.</font></strong></div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div><strong><font size="4">When I arrived at the center after Mass there was Paula waiting for me in the parking lot.&#160; She had brought me bags of clothes &amp; some food for the food shelves from her daughter Hannah, who&#160;bought these things from her baby-sitting money.&#160; What a blessing is this sweet 16 year old girl, who along with her mother volunteered at the Focus Center about 2 years ago before the family&#160;added twin girls form Ethiopia&#160;which they&#160;adopted.&#160; This family is to busy to volunteer at this time but&#160;blesses us with material aid goods, from time to time.&#160; Thanks so much.&#160; &#160;Also Mary Ellen arrived with a baby cradle.&#160; It was so nice of her too.&#160; We are blessed with many people who help us to&#160;exist, by their generous donations, of money, help, time &amp; prayers.&#160; Thanks to ALL of you for making the Focus Center what it is, in saving lives &amp; changing lives.&#160; God bless you!!</font></strong></div>

<p><font size="4"><strong>After they had left I started to set up on the sidewalk with John's help, he had been with me earlier at the protest at the Rochester Convention Center where 5 of us protested the abortionist at Planned Parenthood Rachael Phelps, who was being honored by the Rochester Business Journal for&#160; 'Forty under 40' achievement award.&#160; Do you believe it!!!&#160; An abortionist being honored with her achievements in killing children?&#160; I let the people know very loudly,&#160;as they were walking through the garage tunnel,&#160;what she did over at Planned Parenthood, as an abortionist.&#160;I held a sign that read: DR. RACHAEL PHELPS-ABORTIONIST &amp; PEDIATRICIAN. WHY???</strong><strong>&#160;&#160;Also, PLANNED PARENTHOOD KILLS BABIES. &#160;Colleen let Mayor Duffy know what Phelps did over at Planned Parenthood too when he was walking in the&#160;main door.&#160;HER SIGN&#160;HAD DRIPPING RED COLORED INK&#160;UNDER HER NAME.&#160;He seemed surprised at the notion that she was there receiving an award.&#160; Oh yeah, Mr. Mayor, no wonder there is so much violence here in Rochester, please put 2&#160;in 2 together.</strong></font>&#160;</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">John, Donna,&#160;Mary S. &amp; I were there on the frontlines witnessing the Truth to people.&#160; I was in the center ready to go out on the street when the doorbell rang, it was a man &amp; a woman needing baby clothes.&#160; I stayed with them in the Material Aid room for them to pick out some clothes for their baby.&#160; They were blessed &amp; thanked me for the items.&#160; I was glad that we were able to help.&#160; After they had left I was just about to go out to the front lines to be with the team when the doorbell rang.&#160; It was a young girl needing a pregnancy test.&#160; I gave her the test &amp; counseled her I went out side.&#160; I was there for a short time when a young couple came up the sidewalk.&#160; I offered them help.&#160; She said that she was going into Planned Parenthood for an appointment.&#160; I told them what they do in there &amp; they walked into the building.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; A few minutes later they walked out &amp; came passed us on the sidewalk.&#160; I offered then help once more.&#160; I told them that we had a pregnancy center 2 doors down &amp; started walking with them down the sidewalk.&#160; As we walked I asked them some questions only to find out that the young girl was pregnant &amp; needed our help after all.&#160; I brought them into the center to talk with them.&#160; A few minutes I was calling our doctor that we use for our clients to make an appointment.&#160; After I spoke with the medical secretary I handed the phone to our client to make an appointment.&#160; Our doctor's father had just died so he was out of town so they had to make the appointment in the first week in December.&#160; After that I gave our client a number to call to get set up for insurance.&#160; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; a DVD on Growth &amp; Development, in the womb along with our brochure with my name &amp; contact information.&#160; Later this client was followed up by our Thursday counselor Suzanne where she gave her more information that could help her in her pregnancy.&#160; Also the number for Compass Care to make an appointment for an ultrasound.&#160; While our client was on the phone I brought her boyfriend to see our Material Aid room &amp; said to him that once you know the sex of your baby them please comeback to receive some baby clothes &amp; items for him or her.&#160; Then we went back into the counseling room where our client was off the phone.&#160; I showed her some pictures &amp; talked with her for a little while, her boyfriend said nothing to me but just listened.&#160; After everything was completed &amp; wished them well &amp; told them to call me at anytime for assistance.&#160; Then all of a sudden the young man reached out his hand to shake my hand.&#160; I almost cried.&#160; It meant so much to me&#160; and he said so much to me by this gesture.&#160; I then said that you are doing the right thing.&#160; They smiled at me &amp; left.&#160; I felt so good after this encounter with these 2 fine people who cared about their baby.&#160; Refreshing.&#160; As I was leaving to go out tot the front lines the doorbell rang.&#160; I went to the door &amp; a young woman said that she need a pregnancy test, she seemed very excitable.&#160; She took the test &amp; I counseled her &amp; gave her some literature.&#160; I told her to call me at any time if she need anymore help &amp; gave her our brochure.&#160; She left &amp; I went back to the front lines after eating a quick sandwich.&#160; I got back outside to see that John &amp; Donna were there.&#160; Mary S. had to go back to work.&#160; We handed out Rosaries to the people on the sidewalk &amp; spoke to the victims going in &amp; out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Rachael Phelps's car was not in the parking lot but they get a substitute abortionist when she's not there.&#160; I have the attitude that everyone driving into the Planned Parenthood's parking lot, that has 2 or more people in the car, are going for an abortion.&#160; I usually say " If you are hear for an abortion we can help you to choose life".&#160; I say other things too of course usually that the baby has a heart beat at 18 days after conception &amp; that abortion is not good for the mother too.&#160; We only hope &amp; pray that, through the grace of God, she will change her mind &amp; leave this place with her baby right where he or she should be.&#160; A few minutes later&#160;2 young girls came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; walked passed us on the sidewalk.&#160; I asked if she needed any help &amp; that we give out 'free pregnancy tests'.&#160; They both said "yes".&#160; I walked them into the Focus Center for the tests.&#160; After they were done I counseled them individually.&#160; They filled out a face sheet &amp; when I noticed that one of the girls had had an abortion in the past I counseled her with Post Abortion counseling.&#160; I gave her a lot of information &amp; phone numbers to contact for further help.&#160; It is so sad that after Planned Parenthood has killed their child they go back to them again.&#160; I don't understand any of this madness.&#160; 'There by the grace of God go I.'&#160; They both left after the one girl went to the Material Aid room to get some baby clothes for her baby at home.&#160; They left &amp; I went back out to the frontlines.&#160; Martha I need you!!!&#160; I know that she had to be where she was.&#160; I pray for a Tuesday afternoon counselor ASAP Lord.&#160; Thank you.&#160; I went back outside &amp; Donna left a little while later.&#160; John &amp; I stayed out in the rain until about 4:30pm &amp; went into the center to dry off the signs &amp; put everything away.&#160; I had brought some lunch so we had a late lunch together.&#160; He is a very interesting young man that the Lord has blessed us with.&#160; I did some work in the Material Aid room by making up some Truth packets &amp; putting some baby clothes away.&#160; We left around 8:30pm.</font></strong>&#160;</p>

<div><strong><font size="4">I&#160;arrived at the center around 4pm to let Becki &amp; Amber into the center to continue their work on the computer.&#160; I am always so happy to see them.&#160; They went right to work.&#160; Tucker came in not to much later.&#160; He said that he wasn't feeling to well &amp; needed to go back home.&#160; We spoke about the new center &amp; what needs to be done to present to the zoning board.&#160; I gave him a rough sketch of how I wanted the inside of the new center to look like.&#160;He said that he would get the measurements &amp; then take it to the Zoning Board where&#160;he will&#160;present it to them for a permit so that we can get started to fix up the garage for the&#160;new center.&#160;&#160;He left &amp; Martha wasn't there yet so I went back inside to get Amber to come help me get the boxes of clothes that I had in my car &amp; put it into the Material Aid room to put&#160;away.&#160;&#160;When we were outside&#160;Mike drove up, with the bags of cloths, that he promised to bring to the center.&#160; We spoke with him for about 15 minutes.&#160; He said later that he was impressed with Amber &amp; her great values that she had.&#160; She is the oldest of 10 children &amp; wants a big family herself.&#160; She had mentioned that years ago just before Christmas there was a house fire&#160;&amp; thanks God that everyone got out all right but they lost everything except the Bibles that were not damaged in the inside cover.&#160; God's word was preserved from the flames of the fire.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; She said that she helped to raise most of her sings &amp; that sex is reserved until marriage.&#160; Can she be cloned!!&#160; Mike left &amp; I thanked him &amp; Carla for the clothes.&#160; His lovely wife just had baby # 5 &amp; was at home recuperating from the C-Section.&#160; We said "good bye" &amp; he left.&#160; As we were going back into the center Martha had arrived.&#160; I asked her if she wanted to go out on the frontlines &amp; she said that she did, so off we go with our signs &amp; literature container to witness &amp; to pray in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told the girls that we were going out &amp; if they needed anything please come &amp; get us.&#160; They said "okay".&#160; Martha &amp; I set up &amp; started to pray.&#160; Many cars drove by &amp; mostly gave us a good honk.&#160; But I spoke to soon for the clients coming out of Planned Parenthood the opposite was happening.&#160; We were getting the middle finger at least 3 times by some lively ladies that don't know a thing about 'respect'.&#160; Then the rape counselors were coming in &amp; I said something that made me give the mega a phone to Martha for awhile.&#160; It just makes me so ticked that Planned Parenthood has&#160;rape counseling at an abortion mill &amp; they don't report statuary rape &amp; they get away with it in this city.&#160; It's like the police department is afraid of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Go figure!!!&#160; </font></strong></div>

I say that because he eats over there all the time.&#160; Maybe the restaurant was having a bad evening, I don't mean to judge it to harshly, we are neighbors &amp; need to stick together.&#160; After supper Martha &amp; I worked in the Material Aid room for the next 2 hours.&#160; Martha left still hungry.&#160; Sorry Martha, next time we will bring our own food, for two.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;It was a very rainy day so I made sure that I dressed for the weather.&#160; John &amp; I spoke with many people that the good Lord rough our way.&#160; One gentleman, who is a Christian, comes by every Thursday from somewhere the neighborhood, with a container in hand.&#160; He stopped to talk with us for about 15 minutes, very interesting man with the same values as John &amp; I, though he wasn't Catholic he was witnessed, by John, in a very beautiful way.&#160; Maybe he will be converted.&#160; The girls were rough coming out of Planned Parenthood, sorry to say, were probably Post Abortive.&#160; I wish that we could reach them, before they do this horrible crime, against their child.&#160; Their lives are never the same again.&#160; There were 2 Death Escorts there manning the door.&#160; I get ticked off at them for they provide false compassion, to the girls, as they lead their babies to their deaths.&#160; Melissa, the post abortive young girl that was witnessed to by one of the pro lifers, at the March&#160;in February, has NOT been back, as an Escort, since after the 2nd. March this year, about 6 weeks ago.&#160; Hopefully she has been converted &amp; will NEVER be back again.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that she will get healing.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;A familiar face was walking down the sidewalk.&#160; A sweet girl that I assisted awhile ago when she came into the center for baby clothes &amp; formula. &#160;I said 'how are you &amp; your baby doing".&#160; She replied back that the baby was getting bigger, for he was born prematurely.&#160; She then asked for a pregnancy test, so I said that there was a counselor in the center that could take care of her.&#160; She walked over to the Focus Center after I had said "good- bye" to her.&#160; Suzanne assisted her in what&#160;she &amp; her baby needed.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">John &amp; I stayed out on the frontlines until about 5:00pm.&#160; We went into the center &amp; had some supper.&#160; I brought enough food for two people, no one left hungry tonight.&#160; Then my cell phone rang &amp; it was my dear sweet nephew Sammy.&#160; "Hi Aunt Mi Mi, can you come over tonight".&#160; Oh yea sweet boy. I'll be over around 7pm.&#160; I was so happy to hear his voice.&#160; Around 5:30pm Janet' &amp; Bill came for our Bible Study Classes.&#160; I said that I needed to dry off the signs &amp; put everything away &amp; then I would join them before I had to leave.&#160; John blessed Janet' &amp; Bill &amp; also me with his wisdom.&#160; He is such a blessing to the team &amp; I thank God for him.&#160; He is such a great addition to the team &amp; so is Donna &amp; Carol, our new recruits from the '40 Days for Life" Campaign.&#160; Thank you Lord!&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I arrived&#160;at the&#160;center right after the noon Mass downtown.&#160; I&#160; saw a young girl walking down the street &amp; I called over to her that we are a pregnancy center &amp;if she needed any help we could help her.&#160; She hollered back to me saying "I'm going to keep my baby".&#160; I said if you need anything come over to the center &amp; we can give some&#160; baby clothes to you.&#160; She said "okay" &amp; walked down Gibbs St. probably for the bus.&#160; I was walking back to the center when Pat had gotten out of her car &amp; approached me.&#160; We talked for a few minutes &amp; then I said lets go inside.&#160; We continued to talk &amp; I showed her around the center &amp; the material aid room.&#160; She said I'm going to give you this as I had promised.&#160; I opened up the envelope &amp; saw 8 $25.00 Tops certificates for our clients to be used when necessary for them.&#160; My mouth drooped &amp; I thanked her for her generosity. Pat &amp; I met last year during the '40 Days for Life' campaign.&#160; We both&#160;got into her car &amp; drove up Main St. to find a girl that we had already spoken to in regards to her girlfriend wanting an abortion.&#160; I had some more information that I wanted to give&#160;her to give to her girlfriend.&#160;&#160;Pat remembered that the young girl was holding a pink purse.&#160; Yea, still try to find someone in the crowd even with a pink purse but with a prayer to St. Anthony we did.&#160; Pat spotted her &amp; I ran out of the car to approach the girl to give her the packet of information for her girlfriend.&#160; She said that she would give it to her &amp; said "thank you".&#160; I mentioned, for her &amp; her friend to come to the center at anytime for assistance.&#160; She smiled &amp; ran to her bus.&#160; Thank you Lord up above.&#160; Just then Mary S. came in to get the signs &amp; literature container to take to the front lines.&#160; I invited Pat to come &amp; pray with us &amp; she said that she could for a little while for she had many errands to do.&#160; I was heading out with them when the doorbell rang.&#160; There at the door were&#160;3 young women &amp;&#160;1 young man.&#160; I asked if I could help them &amp; one of the woman said that she was here yesterday getting clothes for her baby &amp; now have brought her pregnant girlfriend, who has 1 year old twin girls&#160;who&#160;&amp; another 3 month old girl &amp; is pregnant with her 4th. girl,&#160;to get some things for her children.&#160;&#160;A young girl, who was with them,&#160;spoke such truth when she said "I don't know how anyone could a little baby"!&#160; She had her head on straight, thank God.&#160; She looked at the graphic pictures &amp; took some more information, for a pro lifer gave them a Truth packet yesterday, while he was out on the sidewalk counseling. Crystal, who is the counselor on Mondays, who is pregnant &amp; due in January, was there in the center&#160;orientating her friend to take her place, so was Melody who works in the Material Aid room,&#160;they assisted them to get some baby things. &#160;The young man took a basketball for his son &amp; they gathered&#160;4 bags full of baby clothes, formula, diapers, books, blankets, stuffed animals &amp; food from our food shelves.&#160; They were all very happy.&#160; I said that they&#160;could come back a second time when they needed to.&#160; &#160;They said "good bye" &amp; left.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><img alt="" width="145" height="112" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/4028437536.jpg" /></font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">I then gathered up some more signs &amp; went out onto the sidewalk to join the others.&#160; When I got there Mary S. said "did you bring the mega phone, for this lady who drove in keeps hollering "Pro Choice, Pro Choice, Pro Choice".&#160; I said I'll go get it.&#160; When I returned to the sidewalk there she was coming out of Planned Parenthood saying the same words over &amp; over again.&#160; I took the mega phone &amp; started to talk to her.&#160; I said " you mean pro death because in your&#160;choice a child dies.&#160; Your choice is vanilla or chocolate, not to kill or not to kill".&#160;&#160;I then said to her, as she was still chanting &amp; trying to get into her car,&#160;" I choose not to&#160;kill you if you say that I have a choice in that decision".&#160; My some miracle she shut&#160;right up&#160;&amp; was quiet.&#160; I feel that the Holy Spirit spoke to her heart that made sense.&#160; I feel that she was convicted by her own words that didn't make sense any more by the power of God.&#160; Amen.&#160; She drove out of the parking lot with her mouth closed not uttering her Pro Choice mantra.&#160; I then looked around to see that Pat had gone but there was Mary S. &amp; Donna &amp; John came a short while later &amp; then our dear Martha.&#160; So we had a good group on the sidewalk this afternoon.&#160; Donna had bought the ministry 200 little 10 week old babies to witness &amp; to handout to the girls &amp; guys.&#160; I know that the Lord has used these models&#160;as a teaching tool,&#160;thus saving lives.&#160; I said thank you for such a generous donation to the center &amp; to the street ministry.&#160; What a blessing.&#160; I was counseling, which can be annoying at times for those who want to pray but I strongly feel that everyone, who goes into this Killing Mill needs to hear a human voice pleading to them to do the right thing, I could be wrong but like I said I have this strong feeling to offer the Truth to everyone gong into Planned Parenthood.&#160; A human cry for Truth &amp; Justice, in this horrible place, of massacring innocent life.&#160;&#160;&#160; Donna moved down the street a little ways to say her Rosary, which is the prayer power that we need when we are out on the frontlines.&#160; Prayer &amp;&#160;works, the Bible says.&#160; </font></strong></p>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Some of the girls were coming out of Planned Parenthood flipping the bird, so I know that they probably had an abortion today or another time in their lives.&#160; Again, it's so very sad &amp; heart breaking.&#160; I went into the center to get something &amp; when I came back out Martha told me that a young girl had gone into Planned Parenthood to get insurance papers, or something like that.&#160; I said, Martha, when she comes out could you please bring her to the center to help her, &amp; she said "sure".&#160; About 10 minutes later she came walking towards us.&#160; Martha brought her to the center to help her, for the young girl told Martha that she knew that she was pregnant.&#160; Martha counseled her &amp; gave her some information to assist her further in her pregnancy.&#160; It's sad to say that she had had an abortion, in the past, &amp; it freaks me out that the girls&#160;go back to Planned Parenthood, who killed their baby.&#160; I just don't understand!!&#160; Instead of hating them for what they did, they go back to them again.&#160; Do they ever wonder what Planned Parenthood did with their baby after they killed their son or daughter???&#160; Abortion seems to be a matter of fact procedure &amp; when it's over it's over.&#160; No feeling after that, that is the question.&#160; Well, thank God she is NOT going to do it again.&#160; Planned Parenthood would not see her today because she didn't have the insurance card with her.&#160; So we will help her in our center where we don't kill babies but love them &amp; their parents.&#160; They Destroy &amp; we Restore.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Martha came back out to join us again.&#160; I asked if she wanted any clothes &amp; she said "no, not at this time. She waiting to find out if he's having a girl or a boy then she will come back".&#160; "Okay, that's fine" I said.&#160; A car,&#160; with a middle aged&#160;man, drove&#160;into the parking lot.&#160; He got out &amp; went into the Administrators door.&#160; I called out to him &amp; waited.&#160; When he was at the exit&#160;he stopped his car&#160;&amp; spoke with us.&#160; He said that he went in to ask about condoms.&#160; I gave him a Truth packet &amp; told him that condoms don't always prevent STD's &amp; gave him a graphic brochure on what each main STD looks like under a microscope.&#160; Then I spoke to him about morality.&#160; I asked if he was married &amp; he said that he was, I didn't see a wedding ring but some guys don't wear them, so I went to the literature container to get him a brochure on Natural Family Planning, which he took.&#160; I said sex in marriage is to be open for new life.&#160; I'm sure he though that&#160;sex was also for pleasure, which of course it is too. &#160;He smiled &amp; thanked us &amp; drove away.&#160; Martha &amp; John also witnessed to him.&#160;&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">Donna had to go &amp; just as she was getting into her car a young attractive red haired, curly top girl came walking briskly up the street towards John &amp; I, for Martha was in the center.&#160; I thought that she was a friend of John's &amp; was coming to pray with us.&#160; That was not the case at all.&#160; She introduced herself saying "I'm a Pro Choice Escort at Planned Parenthood &amp; I just want to command you all for being out here doing what your doing in all kinds of weather.&#160; My eyes almost bugged out of my head.&#160; I said "you are"!&#160; "Oh", she said, I don't want to get you in trouble with Planned Parenthood or anything like that".&#160; I said&#160;" don't worry about that at all".&#160; She went on to ask why we were out here &amp; I replied "it was to save lives".&#160; She mentioned how she disliked Eugenics &amp; I said that is what Planned Parenthood does, so why aren't you with us here on the sidewalk?&#160; She said that she was an Atheists &amp; belongs to the Unitarian/ Universialist church.&#160; This is where PP gets most of their escorts.&#160; I said that would be fine &amp; we were Christians.&#160; She asked not to talk about God otherwise she would not be able to converse with us any longer.&#160; John &amp; her hit a connection &amp; he spoke to her with Truth &amp; Love, which was powerful.&#160; I offered her the Maafia 21: Black Genocide in the 21st. Century &amp; she took it then I offered her the Growth &amp; Development DVD, with the ultrasound pictures &amp; animated abortion procedure &amp; 45 minutes of the testimony of former abortion clinic owner Carol Everett.&#160; Wow!!&#160; I was so happy that she took the 2 educational DVD's.&#160; Thank you Lord!&#160; We spoke to her a little while longer when Martha joined us in the sidewalk again.&#160; I reached over to give our new friend a hug &amp; her arm went up so I thought that maybe she didn't want to hug a stranger.&#160; I said to her "I just want to give you a hug" &amp; she said "a hug that would be great" so I gave her a hug then she ran over to John to get a hug from him &amp; then went over to Martha to get a sweet motherly hug from her.&#160; Wow, what a surprise encounter which I have never had&#160;in all the 24 years I have sidewalk counseled.&#160; As she was leaving I told her with love in my voice that Jesus is Lord.&#160; Off she went with a smile on her pretty face.&#160; Thank you Holy Spirit!!!&#160; Amen &amp; Amen.</font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">Martha, John &amp; I wolfed down Wendy's hamburgers, after Mass,&#160;before we went out to the frontlines for spiritual warfare battle.&#160; We spoke to the girls going into the killing mill, Planned Parenthood &amp; hoped that they would go home with their baby still in their womb.&#160; The 2 worse death escorts were there today, Sylvia Rose &amp; Barry Swan.&#160; They are&#160;very aggressive &amp; determined to get each &amp; everyone into Planned Parenthood to do evil.&#160; Swan came around the bushes to give me Rob's Maafia 21: Black Genocide in the 21st. Century DVD that he let him borrow this past Summer.&#160; John was asking him what he thought of it &amp; I chimed in saying "go away Barry Swan, go away".&#160; I then said to John "please don't talk to him", John is new on the frontlines thus he doesn't know about this horrible person.&#160; He left to go back to his killing post in front of the death doors at Planned Parenthood.&#160; A&#160; very young girl came riding down the street on her bike.&#160; I flagged her over to us on the other side of the sidewalk to talk to her.&#160; She came over &amp; said that she was going into Planned Parenthood for pre natal vitamins.&#160; I suggested for her to come to the center &amp; we would call our doctor to set up an appointment for her to see a 'life giving' doctors instead of Planned Parenthood where they kill babies.&#160; Just then a woman came around the bushes &amp; it was the woman from St. John's Religious Shoppe.&#160; She was coming by for me to see some prayer books that are related to Mothers.&#160; So much was going on at the same time then the death escort came around the bushes telling the woman that she couldn't park in their parking lot.&#160; She then saw our little girl &amp; took her into the killing mill.&#160; The poor girl was so young&#160;she did as she was told &amp; followed the death escort.&#160; John &amp; I waited for 2 hours&#160;until she came out &amp; gave her the Truth packet &amp; a DVD of the Growth &amp; Development of the baby in the womb &amp; a doctors list.&#160;&#160;She took it &amp; smiled.&#160; The death escort Sylvia Rose had gone &amp; now this young girl could get the help that she needed by people of 'Life' not of 'Death'.</font>&#160; </strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="5">Great news!!!</font>&#160; Little Akira has come home form the hospital.&#160; She has lost some weight but hopefully will regain it soon.&#160; She is being taking care of Pat &amp; Arika, the mother, very well but Akira could stop breathing at any time due to her immaturity, for she was born 3 months early.&#160; We trust in the Lord that Akira will get stronger &amp; stronger every day.&#160; Pat wants to thank everyone for all your prayers for Akira's recovery, from the last 'event' when she stopped breathing, that brought her to the hospital.&#160; Also, for your love, support &amp; generosity for the family's needs.&#160; Please keep praying for Pat &amp; her family.&#160; Thank you so much!<br />

Also, another Focus Center baby was just born.&#160; Her name is London &amp; mother &amp; baby are doing very well.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; We are expecting more babies early next year in 2010, that were saved from abortion, through God's grace &amp; the street ministry &amp; the Focus center.&#160; We are in the baby &amp; mother business.&#160; Thank you for your prayers &amp; financial support, for us to continue our pro life work, on University Ave.</font></strong><br />

Mary S. called to say that she could not make it today for she was under the weather, not feeling well but will return to pray on the sidewalk next week. John also called saying that he was still in Bristol with his family &amp; he also will return soon to the frontlines to pray &amp; counsel.&#160; I was <br />
disappointed but knew that a seasoned pro lifer was there, so there was him &amp; I there today.&#160; We have shared the sidewalk for 14 years now, what a great pro lifer &amp; sidewalk counselor.&#160; I always learn from him &amp; always feel safe when he is out there.&#160; It was freezing with the cold wind blowing but God's grace was with us.&#160; A man came by us &amp; asked for food so Rob brought him into the Material Aid Room for food from our food shelves.&#160; He left with 2 bags full &amp; was blessed.&#160; It's a good feeling to see the joy &amp; relief on the peoples faces.&#160; It was very traumatic when the cars just came coming into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood preparing to have their babies killed by Rachael Phelps, the abortionist there.&#160; She makes $ 130,000 a year to kill God's children &amp; to&#160;ruin lives, at Planned Parenthood.&#160; She killed about 5 <br />
precious babies today.&#160; The sidewalk counselor spoke truth to them as they pulled into the parking lot &amp; walked into the Killing Center.&#160; All who entered heard the truth from him.&#160; I witnessed, with the graphic sign &amp; a precious aborted baby, to the people driving in &amp; passing by on the street or walking down the street. The truth of what abortion looks like.&#160; These pictures are real people that were slaughtered by the abortionist by the request of their mother &amp; perhaps the father also.&#160; I showed them all the picture as they were driving in &amp; asked them all to choose life &amp; that we can help them.&#160; One woman hollered to us "I'm going in here to ask questions &amp; I'm a Christian so shut-up".&#160; Just so typical!!&#160; How sad a remark, imagine getting answers from people who kill people?&#160; She should have come to us for the truth.&#160; But no, they go to the evil ones.&#160; How sad.&#160; We won't give up telling people the truth, we just know that not everyone will listen.&#160; A couple were walking down the street &amp; the gentleman was saying something to us like , it sounded negative but we responded with love back to him.&#160; They went into Planned Parenthood &amp; came out not to long after.&#160; We offered them <br />
a truth packet &amp; they walked over to us.&#160; The counselor asked her if she wanted a pregnancy test &amp; she responded back "yes".&#160; He said we can help you then.&#160; I said please follow me into the Focus Center for the test.&#160; They did &amp; I assisted our client in the help that she needed.&#160; After I was finished I went back onto the frontlines to be with the other side walk counselor who said that he had given out a truth packet &amp; talked to a young man who said that he was asked to bring a woman here &amp; he hoped that she wasn't there for an abortion.&#160; Poor guy.&#160; I hope that she wasn't either.&#160; So many people are affected by abortion, innocent &amp; guilty ones.</font></strong></p>

They were shocked &amp; I went into the counseling room to get another truth packet &amp; more information for them to take home with them.&#160; I also gave them the Maafa: Black Genocide in the 21 st.

our male sidewalk counselor.&#160; We had chicken, rice, Cole slaw, cranberry sauce, stuffing &amp; a mean chocolate cake.&#160; There was 5 of us celebrating the meaning of 'birthdays' &amp; not 'death days' like they celebrate at Planned Parenthood.&#160; We had a great time &amp; Pat, the grandmother of 4 &amp; great grand mother of our 2 babies that were saved from abortion.&#160; We made up a plate &amp; she had a nice meal.&#160; We got to visit with her until she had to go home to care for her family.&#160; God bless you Pat &amp; we love you &amp; your family.

<div><strong><font size="4">There we were, the 2010 team in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Donna, Mary S. John &amp; myself were there to try to save lives from being killed at Planned Parenthood's Killing Mill.&#160; I was able to do some things, in the center, before going out on the front lines because of the team already being out there.&#160; It was so good to see Mary S. after 2 weeks &amp; Donna after 1 week.&#160; All&#160;pro lifers&#160;are a blessing.&#160; We set up the signs &amp; put the literature box out there &amp; was ready to witness the truth to the public.&#160; As I was leaving the center to go out to the front lines a woman hollered from her car "is the center open for some baby clothes"?&#160; I said back to her "yes it is, come follow me".&#160; Two young women got out of the car &amp; went into the Material Aid Room to get clothes &amp; some small items for their children.&#160; They both were very happy to get clothes, books, DVD's, toys &amp; stuffed animals for their children.&#160; I was happy for them, the smiles on their faces brought me joy.&#160; The one woman said to me "you have a nice place here".&#160; I said back to her&#160;"thank you so very&#160;much".&#160; I think that they left with 4 bags full.&#160; I gave them some candy to go on their way.&#160;&#160;I said "good bye" to them &amp; then went to the front lines to be with the team.&#160; </font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">We looked across the street, to see who was hollering at us, only to find out it was the middle age&#160;man named Jim, who just bought the first condo nearest to the corner.&#160; He was making the sign of the cross at us, many times over.&#160; I told him he was committing blasphemy &amp; to stop, for his soul sake.&#160; He then hollered to us saying "I just spoke with Fr. O'Malley &amp; he said that he was coming to do an&#160;Exorcism on you".&#160; I said "I'd like to meet Fr. O'Malley, he&#160;sounds Irish".&#160; Then Martha said "maybe Jim, he meant you for the&#160;&#160;Exorcism, for you live across the street from a Killing Mill".&#160; We told him to go away &amp; as he was going into&#160;his garage, still mouthing off, &amp; as&#160;he was walking under the closing garage door, bending down,&#160;it looked like he was about to be decapitated.&#160; How awful.&#160; What goes around come around.&#160; Though, I would not have wanted to see that horror.&#160; God is merciful!&#160; We need to pray for the crazy neighbors on University Ave. some more.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">(Don't think I'm insensitive to&#160;the rape survivors&#160;plight, if she gets pregnant from the rape,&#160;but I do know that abortion is NOT the answer.&#160; She can get&#160;some relief after the rape, through counseling, love &amp; support, for it is never her fault, that she was raped.&#160;&#160;But&#160;in&#160;having an&#160;abortion, a woman or girl, remains a victim to that realization, that an&#160;innocent baby was killed, for the crime of the&#160;rapist, even after God forgives her, she can't forgive herself. &#160;She can get healing &amp; that can ease the pain but not entirely. &#160;She can never really forgive herself for the taking of a life of an innocent baby, that was conceived in that violent act against her, now she has repeated that violent act upon an innocent victim, just like herself. &#160;The rape&#160;isn't her fault but the abortion is her fault.&#160;Such guilt to bear.&#160;This makes her situation worse no matter what the general population thinks.&#160;&#160;Abortion always takes a life &amp; it is not good for a woman nor the baby.&#160; Rape wounds the heart, emotions &amp; psyche &amp; sometimes the body but the victim is not dead from the rape, she is wounded, if she survives it.&#160; Rape is evil &amp; is horrible &amp; I do understand the horror of it as a survivor.)&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">When she came out of the Vets office I offered her some special literature&#160;for&#160;help &amp; healing.&#160; She refused it &amp; drove away with her husband.&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">I only&#160;hope&#160;that she will see,&#160;how wrong it was for her to have an abortion after the rape, &amp; seek out help from a good person.&#160; Two wrongs do not make a right.&#160; Unless she gets out of denial, thinking that she had&#160;the right, to have an abortion,&#160;she will be tormented forever &amp;&#160;never be&#160;at peace,&#160;which can only come through God's love &amp; forgiveness.&#160; I pray her well &amp; all women like her.&#160;There by the grace of God go I, perhaps.</font></strong></div>

<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;I then went back to the other side of the sidewalk to be with Martha &amp; John &amp; Martha told me that she was praying for me across the street especially when she saw that she was being aggressive towards me.&#160; It was a very sad story for sure.&#160; As I was standing I saw the station wagon with the young kids driving out.&#160; We spoke truth to them.&#160; I said to them "I hope that no baby was killed here today" &amp; the young girl in the front seat looked at me with sad eyes &amp; nodded her head 'yes'.&#160; What is in store for these 4 young kids, in the future,&#160;is mind shattering.&#160; How they will suffer.&#160; It all could have been avoided, if they only drove away, &amp; not have gone in Planned Parenthood today.&#160; "Lord have Mercy" I told them as they drove out.&#160; My heart was aching at this point.&#160; Then after that, there were the pick ups from the drop off's 2 hours earlier.&#160; If these people think that their problem went away today,&#160;they are only now fooling themselves.&#160;</font></strong></div>

<p align="left"><strong><font size="4">Martha called to tell me that she was sick &amp; could not make it today.&#160; John was not available until later, &amp; Bill left the sidewalk when I got there.&#160; I think that he got there at 12noon till 1pm instead of 1pm to 2pm.&#160; I called him later on to clear this up for next week.&#160; So I was alone on the sidewalk battling Evil, with the help of the Lord &amp; Mother Mary &amp; St. Michael &amp; the Warrior Angels, with me.&#160; I prayed in tongues &amp; Rick Bartell, who works at Planned Parenthood,&#160;was curious so he walked to the sidewalk to find out what was going on, only to see just me.&#160; They don't understand Spiritual Warfare.&#160; Cars were going in &amp; I spoke 'life' to all of them, but they do not listen to the Truth, so they go into Planned Parenthood to have their precious child brutally killed, all because, they do not want these God given children, in their lives.&#160; They DO NOT want the responsibility in raising this child that was conceived by their sexual pleasure.&#160; Like I said to this couple who was waiting for their friend to come out&#160;&amp; were talking to Death Escorts, that "children are killed all because of an orgasm", you want the sex but not the child, that was conceived in that activity".&#160; How selfish.&#160;&#160; As I was talking to deaf ears the doors to Planned Parenthood opened &amp; out came 3 Black women, one in the middle, hardly able to stand up, &amp; being held up by one&#160;woman on one side &amp; the other woman&#160;on the other side of her.&#160; As they were&#160;driving out I told the women that you both were an accomplice to the crime &amp; murder &amp; to repent.&#160; The one woman just looked at me with possible remorse in her eyes.&#160; I hope so.&#160; Only God can forgive such a horrible sin as abortion.&#160; &#160;I told the couple that were talking to the Death Escorts, by the entrance, that they will never be able to get that image of those 3&#160;women coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; That their minds were a camera &amp; this image will be&#160;with them&#160;forever.&#160; Then the woman went, to the parked car, by the door, to get her baby out of the car to show the Death Escorts.&#160; My stomach almost dropped.&#160; If anyone knows me at all they would know that I hate to see people bring their children into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said to the mom that "this is no place for&#160;your child &amp; that if you were pregnant, with this child, &amp; did not want&#160;your baby&#160;then the very people that you are talking to now would open the door for you to go, kill your baby, in this very building".&#160; I said that they only like kids that are born &amp; not kids that haven't been born yet.&#160; Prejudice against the unborn they are.&#160; They just laughed &amp; turned their car radio on loudly.&#160; I said "this must be getting to you &amp; at least you have some reaction, which means there is 'HOPE' for you.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I was witnessing on the sidewalk the Truth about abortion &amp; along come the RTS city bus driver who gave me trouble on Tuesday, &amp; I called&#160;to report&#160;him the next day.&#160; So, of course, I thought that they brought him in to speak to him about his stopping the bus to harass me.&#160; But I was wrong.&#160; There he is, &amp; me being by myself, again stops the huge double bus to harass me.&#160; I said "I hope that you stop this for I will call again to report you, I don't want you to lose your job".&#160; Well, I guess he didn't hear me because about an hour later there he was again &amp; this time he honked to get my attention only to harass me again.&#160; Oh I said to myself "I can't wait for tomorrow to make the call".&#160; I did the next day to the RTS office &amp; asked to speak to a Supervisor, this time, no more fooling around.&#160; If anyone, who has ever called RTS, they would know that it takes forever to speak to anyone.&#160; So the Supervisor finally answered &amp; I told her the whole story but what I didn't tell her was that if it happens again I will call the police to report him for harassment.&#160; I feel, this time, someone will speak to him.&#160; I told her that this&#160;was non professional &amp; inexcusable for a city bus driver to do &amp; also dangerous.&#160; She agreed.&#160; Lets see on Tuesday what happens.&#160; I also told her that I don't want him fired only talked to.&#160; What happens now is out of my hands.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<div><font size="4"><strong>John was on the sidewalk now &amp; I just had seen a woman come out of Planned Parenthood being held by 2 women after having had an abortion, so of course I was upset.&#160; Just then I heard someone say something to me &amp; I turned around to see 3 young girls behind me.&#160; One of the girls said to me " Suzanne told us to come to ask you Mary,&#160;for some packets".&#160; I said " oh yes here you are".&#160; I also said "where you in the center"?&#160; They said "yes".&#160; I then said "is everything okay".&#160; The one girl&#160;replied "yes, I'm keeping my baby".&#160; I said "oh, I'm so very happy to hear that".&#160; I said that Suzanne will be checking in with you on Thursdays.&#160; She said "that will be fine".&#160; I asked if they were all sisters &amp; the one girl said that one was her sister &amp; the other girl was her close friend.&#160; I said "so you are a sisterhood", to which they smiled.&#160; Then I gave a big hug to our pregnant mom &amp; offered her baby clothes when she finds out if she is having a boy or girl.&#160; She said "that would be great".&#160; As they were walking away I said to the new mom "I am so glad that you chose life rather than abortion, which I could hardly say the word.&#160; She said "yes, I know".&#160; They walked down the street to go to their car &amp; I felt like the Good Lord had given me a big hug in letting me know that someone had chosen 'life' for their child.&#160; Amen!!&#160; See you girls in the near future.</strong>&#160; </font></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">There were about 25 people, in front of Planned Parenthood tonight, with tape on their mouths, representing the voiceless victims of abortion, that are killed&#160;here &amp; elsewhere in this country &amp; worldwide.&#160;&#160;They stood in the cold, for 1 hour, as a witness to life. &#160;After that we all walked over to the new center to claim the property for Christ, to work a mighty work.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">We prayed for the conversion of the neighbors, in this apathetic&#160;&#160;neighborhood, that does nothing in stopping the mass murdering, that goes on at Planned Parenthood.&#160; Their silence is deafening.&#160; &#160;</font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">I went back outside &amp; Mary S. had to go back to work &amp; I was alone.&#160; I know that the Lord &amp; Mother Mary &amp; the Warring Angels,&#160;were with me.&#160; Be not afraid I had work to do.&#160; The next incident happened soon after Mary S. left.&#160; A woman with a darling little boy cane over to me.&#160; I said "would you like free baby clothes"?&#160; She said "yes I would".&#160; I then said we have a pregnancy center right next to this yellow building &#160;&amp; if you could help me with these signs &amp; literature box I will take you there.&#160; I didn't want to leave these things outside without anybody being there because somebody&#160;could come by to steal them.&#160; She was nice to help with the box &amp; I with the&#160;signs &amp; off we 3 went into the center.&#160; I asked her what she would be doing at Planned Parenthood &amp; she said that she brought her cousin in for an ultrasound &amp; that she wanted an abortion &amp; I told her no way &amp; now she is going to have her baby.&#160; I said "you did very well &amp; you saved this baby's life form being killed".&#160; You are a "life saver &amp; God bless you".&#160; I then went over to the Taxi company to get Kaylyn to help me.&#160; Her boss said that she could so I left the ladies &amp; the cute little boy to get some baby items.&#160; Kaylyn told me to get back outside to&#160;"save lives".&#160; I told her briefly that a baby was saved earlier this afternoon.&#160; She smiled &amp; said "that's great" &amp; off I went back outside with the signs &amp; literature box to set up shop once again, on the sidewalk.&#160; &#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">There were men on the roof of Planned Parenthood putting on a new roof.&#160; I said to them earlier to pray for the mother &amp; fathers &amp; their babies form being aborted.&#160; I told them that someone was praying for a baby had been saved.&#160; A one guy put up two of his thumbs &amp; said to him then it must of been your prayers that God hear &amp; answered.&#160; The supervisor gave me a hand brush &amp; I told him not to disrespect me again.&#160; I went on &amp; on &amp; on to the guys on the roof.&#160; They had to listen to me, they had no where to go.&#160; Then the neighbor came out from across the street to harass me.&#160; I was going to let him start first which he did.&#160; He put his fingers on his head to make it look like horns.&#160; I said to him after that that were are not the crazy ones, we are not killing anyone but they are killing in Planned Parenthood.&#160; Now then who's the crazy ones??&#160; He went back into his condo, which is right across the street from Planned Parenthood.&#160; Go figure!!</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Oh now the bus driver, who I reported twice last week, started up again.&#160; Some people never learn.&#160; This time he took his hands off the wheel to harass me.&#160; I guess I have to call the RTS again tomorrow.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">A car drove out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I said something to her &amp; offered her a Truth packet &amp; she pulled over to the side of the street.&#160; I put my head into her car window to speak to her, she looked sad.&#160; I then said to her " have you had an abortion"?&#160; She replied "not yet", I have a child &amp; I can't afford another".&#160;My heart dropped in my chest &amp; then I said "you can't have your little baby be killed for financially reason nor for any reason this is a little brother or sister for your child at home".&#160; Then &amp; asked to wait &amp; I went over to the literature box &amp; grabbed the 2 DVD's.&#160; The one about Growth &amp; Development &amp; the other was Maafa 21: Black Genocide in the 21st Century &amp; a little baby that was 10 weeks old.&#160; I pleaded with her not to do this &amp; I could tell from her eyes that she will nor could not.&#160; I consider this a baby saved today.&#160; I told her that we have free baby clothes at the Focus Center &amp; anything that she needs &amp; a counselor on Thursdays from 1:30 to 4pm to speak to &amp; she could also help her to receive help in the community.&#160;I gave her a brochure. &#160;She smiled &amp; said that she would &amp; I started to cry for I told her that I lost a sibling &amp; it was difficult growing up without him.&#160; I feel that we connected.&#160; She smiled &amp; drove away after I told her to call for assistance anytime of day or night.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">A young girl pulled into Planned Parenthood &amp; I spoke to her &amp; she gave me the bird.&#160; I told her not to show me her IQ &amp; that it was a rape symbol &amp; how discussing for a female to use that to another female &amp; that she was degrading herself.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Two young girls came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; said "don't worry lady we're didn't have an abortion.&#160; The one girl said "I was in there to have the IUD removed".&#160; I leaned over to her &amp; said "did you know that it can cause an early abortion".&#160; She said "yes, that's way I had it removed &amp; I'm not going to have sex before marriage &amp; we both are going to get Chastity Rings from our Grandma".&#160; I gave then both a big huge together which was a group hug &amp; told them that I was proud of them &amp; that they were our future".&#160; They smiled &amp; walked away.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">A young girl was walking in &amp; she saw the signs &amp; came over to me.&#160; I spoke to her briefly &amp; gave her a Truth packet.&#160; Thank God that Melody had arrived &amp; was making packets for me to hand out.&#160; I must have handed out about 8 or 9 today.&#160; She keep me well supplied.&#160;&#160;The young girl&#160;said that she has a child, at home, &amp; was going in there for a physical.&#160; I offered her free baby clothes &amp; she said that when she comes out she'd come over to the center to get some.&#160; I pointed to where the center was.&#160;Off she went into the Killing Mill.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">A few minutes later 2 young girls came around the bushes towards me.&#160; The one girl I recognized for she was the young girl I spoke with last Wednesday, at the center.&#160; She was post abortive &amp; has a 1 year old child at home with her &amp; her Grandmother.&#160; Her mother made her have an abortion just last year.&#160; She is pregnant again &amp; I called her, this past week &amp; so did Suzanne, &amp; I didn't hear back from her so I was worried that she went back to Planned Parenthood to have an abortion.&#160; When she saw me she said "I didn't have an abortion, I not going to do that again, I was hear for friend who was being tested for STD"S.&#160; I gave her our brochure &amp; circled Compass Care for her to call them &amp; not to come back her again.&#160; She said "thank you" &amp; I gave my little girl a big hug &amp; told her that Suzanne will be calling her again &amp; she said that would be fine".&#160; I asked if she had spoken to Sandi from Embracing Options for post abortion healing &amp; she&#160;said that she had.&#160; Great!!&#160; I asked if she had seen the Growth &amp;&#160;Development DVD &amp; she said that she had &amp; it was very good.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I was so glad to know that she was not going to have her precious baby&#160;killed.&#160;I was worried.&#160;I felt&#160;like my prayer was answered, by the Lord, which gave me peace of mind.&#160; Off the 2 girls went down the street very happy.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Walking down the sidewalk was a young girl &amp; a guy.&#160; They stopped to talk to me &amp; I asked them why they were going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said for testing.&#160; I asked was if for STD testing &amp; she said "yes".&#160; I took on of our brochures for the literature box &amp; circled Compass Care for her to go to get STD testing.&#160; She smiled &amp; thanked me &amp; said that it was convenient now for her to go in.&#160; I asked her to&#160;hide the Truth packet, for I didn't want Planned Parenthood to take it, from her.&#160; She came out alone later on &amp; I saw that she was wearing a cross necklace around her neck &amp; I asked her "you must know Jesus" &amp; she said "yes I do".&#160; I didn't preach to her but I felt that we had a connection in regards for her to do&#160;better with His help.&#160; God forgives any &amp; all sins with a sincere heart.&#160; Off she went walking down the street.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">A car pulled out of the driveway with 2 young girls in the front seat.&#160; I said to them, as I showed them the graphic sign, of the aborted baby.&#160; "here are your tears, where are your tears"?&#160; The driver of the car stuck out her tongue at me &amp; I then said to her "where is your heart".&#160; Off she drove out of the Killing Mill.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">So sad.</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">There she was Marsha Peone, starting to look her age, driving into the clinic of death.&#160; I haven't seen her in a long time &amp; of course I get hopeful that&#160;she&#160;had repented, but no.&#160; This dedicated former NOW (National Organization of Women) President was back to the Killing Mill.&#160; She was picking up another female.&#160;As she was&#160;driving out&#160;I said to her&#160;"we love you Massachusetts"!!&#160; Later on America found out that&#160;Scott Brown, a Rep. won the Senate seat.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; The 'Tide is Turning".&#160; Praise God!!</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Tanya came walking down the street &amp; introuduced me to her brother &amp; they neeeded food from our food shelves &amp; some baby clothes for his daughter.&#160; I told them to ring the bell, at the center, &amp; Melody would take care of them.&#160; They said "thank you" &amp; off they went.&#160; We have been working with Tanya for many years now &amp; hope that her life will straighten out someday.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">It was 5 pm so I went into the center to see &amp; talk with Melody for a awhile before I went to the Second Hand store to see my friend &amp; to get more baby clothes &amp; small items, for the center.&#160; It's been awhile to go to the store to shop, which I enjoy very much&#160;&amp; to see my friend.&#160; She leaves me bags of goodies, for the center, in my garage if I can't get over there to the store during the week, which has been pretty hard lately.&#160; The center &amp; I were blessed once again.&#160; Thanks sweet girl.</font></strong>&#160;</div>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I decided to see what was going on Wednesday afternoons.&#160; Some information came my way that Wednesday is also a Killing Day.&#160; The abortionist, Racheal Phelps was there, so we figured that she was killing little babies, today.&#160; I feel badly that I wasn't there on Wednesday's earlier, for we get there at 4PM that's too late.&#160; Hopefully Martha &amp; I can do Wednesday afternoon too.&#160; When we got to the center we had to deal with some conflicts there first before we went out to the Front Lines.&#160; I got $20, from the Landlord, to replace&#160;the loss of literature in the counseling room due to the water leak in the ceiling.&#160; If only he'd put a new roof on, there would be no more leaks.&#160; Also, we had a&#160;discrepancy with the men's bathroom.&#160; The guys don't like it because it's too cold &amp; there is a leak,&#160;so they use the&#160;Women's Room, which I object to.&#160;&#160;Us ladies want the Women's Room to be clean, at all times, for our clients.&#160; So I discussed this problem with the Landlord.&#160; Lots of luck to get the Men's Room water leak &amp; heating problem fixed.&#160; I can only hope!!&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I was setting up outside, on the sidewalk, &amp; I had to go back in the center to get more signs &amp; when I came back out Martha told me that she had an experience with a young man as follows:&#160;&#160; A young guy was driving into Planned Parenthood with a young girl in the car.&#160; He stopped just before he got to the driveway &amp; rolled down hi window to say to Martha, "can I have this sign (our graphic sign of a precious aborted baby)?&#160; Martha said "no" this is a picture of an aborted baby.&#160; Then he said " I want to put it into my bedroom, for I am a Pathologists student".&#160; Martha said "that's not going to happen".&#160; The car went into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood &amp; then drove right out.&#160; How sick!&#160; I'm sorry that I wasn't with her when this happened, for I was gone for such a short time.&#160; God is with us.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I were standing on the sidewalk when a car was coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; There were 2 women in the car.&#160; The driver said to us "she is going to keep her baby &amp; we support what you are doing".&#160; I then said to them "we have free baby clothes, in our center, which is right next to this yellow building, just follow Martha &amp; she can help you".&#160; They did.&#160; She followed Martha, into the center, to get some baby clothes.&#160; The mom didn't know if she was going to have a little boy or girl but she got a blanket never the less.&#160; The mother-in -law, that was driving the car,&#160;said that they were coming back tomorrow to Planned Parenthood to get an ultrasound.&#160; Martha suggested that they call Compass Care instead &amp; gave them the phone #.&#160;&#160; They said that they didn't like the feeling they got, when they went into&#160;Planned Parenthood, &amp; now even more so because they know that they kill babies there.&#160; I hope that they will call Compass Care to get the ultrasound.&#160; When they know, if she is going to have a boy or a girl, then they can come back to get some baby clothes &amp; small items.&#160; We will&#160;keep in touch with these 2 wonderful women.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">A car drove in with a young girl &amp; guy.&#160; The girl got out of the car &amp; the guy stayed in the car.&#160; Not good a scenario.&#160; I noticed that he was sitting in the car for a long time which is not good.&#160; This usually means that the girl, who went in, is going for an abortion.&#160; I then started to talk to him more seriously.&#160; He smirked at Martha &amp; I, which gave us both the creeps.&#160; After awhile he started to give us his middle finger &amp; when he pulled out of the driveway with the girl in the car, he really gave us the finger.&#160; I know that his conscious was starting to bother him but it was to late, his baby was dead.&#160; How very sad, that sometimes they realize what they did, after they do it when it's to late for the baby &amp; for them.&#160; Lord have Mercy on their souls &amp; we hope &amp; pray that they both repent, very soon.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Two girls were walking sown the sidewalk &amp; went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Martha spoke to them.&#160; They came out a few minutes later &amp; came over to us.&#160; We spoke to them &amp; Martha brought them into the center for a pregnancy test &amp; instruction for better behavior.&#160; Sometimes when the girls get a negative test they think that they are 'out of the woods' &amp; go right back to the same destructive behavior until they get caught.&#160; Instead of learning they make the same mistake again.&#160; Playing 'Russian Roulette" which only makes you a 'loser'.&#160; The cycle has to change!!</font></strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong><font size="4">A young was walking up the street &amp; I stopped her to ask if she would like some information &amp; if she was going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that she was going in for condoms &amp; that she was engaged".&#160; I said before you get married you'll be all used up, save yourself for marriage".&#160; She waked in &amp; came out about 10 minutes later &amp; walked across the street.&#160; I wanted to further the conversation &amp; told her that condoms don't really protect from all sexually transmitted diseases nor pregnancy &amp; if you get pregnant will you come back here to have your baby killed".&#160; As she was walking she shook her head 'no'.&#160; I really hope not but she's not in that situation now, her mind might change if she is.&#160; My advice is "DON'T TAKE A CHANCE, YOU MIGHT LOOSE".</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">A gentleman, that I knew from days go by, came by to be with Martha &amp; I.&#160; He said that he could only stay for a few minutes to give support.&#160; After a short time he said that he had to go back to work &amp; was walking back to his parked car on the street.&#160; I said something to him &amp; he then walked back towards Martha &amp; I.&#160; He said that a long time ago, when he was in High School, his girlfriend came up to him &amp; said "I'm pregnant &amp; I don't want to be &amp; I'm having an abortion".&#160; For years he has been suffering from that comment.&#160; He wasn't sure if she was telling him that because he was the father of her baby or someone else was.&#160; I had&#160;to tell him straight out that she was telling him that, because he was the father of the baby.&#160; Sometimes the Truth hurts but it will 'set you free'.&#160; He will never heal &amp; be set free if he is never sure &amp; goes round &amp; round in this.&#160; I said to him "did you had sex with her"?&#160; He looked at me funny as if to say "well of course I did".&#160; But what I was trying to make him aware was, if you had sex with her then you could very possibly be the father of the baby that she had killed, which was your son or daughter.&#160; I gave him a Project Rachal card &amp; hopefully he will call that number to start the journey to healing &amp; be set free from this realization of the loss of his child, so he can grieve .&#160; </font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">I knew that I was going to be by myself this afternoon.&#160; Maybe not if Bill shows up, which he did 20 minutes later.&#160;I knew that Suzanne would in the center at 1:30 so I should be all right. &#160;Martha was resting up to go to Washington for the 'March for Life' &amp; John is trying to settle some things that are going on in his life, at this time.&#160; I arrived on the sidewalk &amp; was there only for about 10 minutes when a young girl was walking down the street towards me.&#160; I asked her if she needed anything like a free pregnancy test &amp; she said that she did.&#160; I walked her into the center thinking that Suzanne would be there in 10 minutes so I said to the young girl to relax &amp; go into the Material Aid Room to get some things for your 2 boys, which she told me about as we walked into the center, &amp; that Suzanne would be in to help her with the pregnancy test.&#160; I went back outside because I had left the signs &amp; literature box on the sidewalk.&#160; Bill was across the street.&#160; I stayed for about 10 minutes &amp; became concerned that Suzanne hadn't arrived yet.&#160; I decided to pack up &amp; go into the center to help the client with what she needed.&#160; I walked over to Bill &amp; told him that I was going into the center &amp; he said that he would stay until 3pm, it was 1:30pm now.&#160; I thanked him &amp; looked over to the 2 Death Escorts only to see the blonde give me a demonic smile through the bushes.&#160; Off I went to the center to concentrate on our young client.&#160; I found her &amp; told her that I was going ahead with the pregnancy test.&#160; She asked to use our phone to make a call first.&#160; I gave her the phone &amp; went to set up the pregnancy test.&#160; My cell phone rang &amp; it was Suzanne&#160;calling to tell me that she had a fender bender at Delta&#160; Sonic up the street &amp; will be at the center in about 15 minutes.&#160; I was glad to hear from her.&#160; The client did the pregnancy test &amp; it was positive &amp; was post abortive with 2 boys at home, with her mother.&#160; Lord give me the right words to say.&#160; She was affected by the past abortion &amp; her mother would support in her decision.&#160; Thanks mom for your wishy washey mentally.&#160; Thank God that she wanted this baby.&#160; I made an appointment for her at Embracing Options for the PACE program.&#160; This is for Post Abortive women &amp; girls to heal &amp; reconside with the Lord.&#160; Also, I got her to call Compass Care to go for an ultrasound &amp; STD testing, for this afternoon.&#160; Just then the doorbell rang &amp; it was a young girl asking for a pregnancy test.&#160; I brought her into the meeting room &amp; gave her some magazines &amp; told her that I would be with her in a short while.&#160; I asked her if she wanted some water but she said "no". She was very nice. &#160;I went into the counseling room to be with our other client &amp; asked her to fill out an Intake Sheet, which she did.&#160; I then said for her to go into the Material Aid Room to get some things for her 2 sons, which she did.&#160; Just then the front door opened &amp; there was Suzanne.&#160; I gave her a hug &amp; orientated her real fast.&#160; She went into the meeting room &amp; assisted&#160;our new client with a pregnancy test &amp; some counseling.&#160; After that I briefed her about our other client who was pregnant.&#160;&#160;She called her mother &amp; told her that she was pregnant &amp; her mother left the decision up to her, in what to do.&#160; Thanks mom.&#160; We all 3 talked for awhile &amp; then decided to call, Compass Care, to try to get an appointment a little earlier.&#160; Suzanne called &amp; got a 3pm appointment.&#160;She said that he would drive her over for the appointment &amp; stay with her &amp; then take her home.&#160; I then encouraged her to get enough things for her children &amp; hurry to get to the appointment on time.&#160; She did.&#160; She was blessed with many nice things to take home to her sons.&#160; All is well with this mom.&#160; After they left I stayed in the center to do many things.&#160; I know that the Lord was with the&#160;victims going into Planned Parenthood &amp; hoped all 'Chose Life'.&#160; Planned Parenthood did not look busy this afternoon.&#160; I feel strongly that the hearts of men are changing, through the grace of God!!</font>

<div><font size="4">I got a fast bite to eat &amp; did some work in the center.&#160; Janet', who is a Social Worker &amp;&#160;loves the Lord,&#160;came in around 4pm, for a counseling session &amp; I was blessed by her love &amp; support &amp; prayers, for my healing of my past wounds.&#160; God is Great!!&#160; I got a call on my cell phone &amp; it was my sweet nephew Sammy, asking if I could come over to see him.&#160; I said "yes" in a hurry.&#160; I left the center at 6:30 pm, to go see my sweet Sammy &amp; his sister &amp; their mother, my adopted sister.&#160; </font></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">I was running late, for noon Mass downtown, like always but when I parked on Andrews I spotted a woman with a child about 6 years old.&#160; I felt lead by the Lord to engage her. &#160;I offered her a Rosary &amp; then told her that we, at the Focus Pregnancy Help Center, could give her clothes for her son,&#160;if she needed them.&#160; She said that she did.&#160; I said to her quickly, that I would be at the center at 1pm &amp; gave her the address&#160;&amp; told her that it was&#160;up the street, in the strip mall.&#160; I said 1:30pm would work out well for me &amp; she said that she would see me then &amp; off I go to Church &amp; I wasn't even late, thank God.&#160; After Mass I headed over to the center &amp; there she &amp; her son were, in the parking lot by the center, she came early.&#160; She apologized but I said that it was okay &amp; really it worked out better that she came early.&#160; I brought her &amp; her 6 year old son into the Material Aid Room, to get some things.&#160;&#160;She &amp; her son were blessed with many nice things.&#160; She also needed food for her &amp;&#160;her son for they had been invicted from their home.&#160; I told her to take what she needed &amp; to come back at another time also for more clothes &amp; food.&#160; She said "thank you&#160;&amp; that she would".&#160; My heart went out to her &amp; her son.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>When I came back to the sidewalk to be with Mary S. the guy on the roof, <br />
where a bunch of guys were replacing the roof to Planned Parenthood, started to harass me.&#160; He hollered down to me to get a life &amp; to go home.&#160; I said "keep it up &amp; I will report you to your boss &amp; you could lose your job".&#160; He was a smart mouth.&#160; He did something with his finger &amp; I told him that it might drop off, for God sees it all &amp; He protects His own.&#160; Where did this guy come from?&#160; These guys have been on the roof for a week now &amp; I get flap from this guy now.&#160; I told him that if he had paid for an abortion, in the past, that we could help him to recover.&#160; Most people that harass us are 'Post Abortive', men &amp; women alike.&#160; How frustrating it is for us, because they don't understand that we are the ones that can help them, to get the real help they need, in order for them to recover.&#160; How sad!</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">As Mary S. &amp; I, were standing on the sidewalk, a car was coming out with a baby, in a car seat, in the back &amp; a post abortive woman in the front.&#160; She had been picked up by a guy who had just driven in.&#160; She was slumped down in the front seat &amp; had that look in her eyes.&#160; Now this little baby in the back seat just lost his or she brother or sister.&#160; The child will find out someday &amp; will need much healing &amp; forgiveness.&#160; I hope that there will be forgiveness in this family that 'took a life'.&#160; What about the siblings that are suffering, with the loss of a brother or sister, who is helping them?&#160; They are hurting too.&#160; </font></strong></p>

I knew that God was with&#160;us.&#160; Before Maria started to say the Rosary I told her that I just saw a cardinal.&#160; I couldn't believe it.&#160;&#160;I thought that this bird comes in the Springtime, he lost his family, they left Rochester without telling him.&#160; Poor birdie.&#160; Seeing this bird made me feel that the Lord was blessing our ministry.&#160; Earlier when Mary S. was with me just before she left, there were 2 boys around 9 or 10 years old who came around the bushes &amp; looked at the graphic pictures.&#160; The one boy said "this just isn't right".&#160;We said that this place kills babies.&#160; We have to tell the truth &amp; we felt that they could handle this info.&#160;They were young with such wisdom.&#160; I gave each of them the 10 week old baby, with the growth &amp; development chart.&#160; They said that their Aunt was in there &amp; then went back to there car, which was parked next to the bushes.&#160; About&#160;25 minutes later now Maria was there, when a woman came around the bushes, &amp; said to&#160;us "are you both Christians".&#160; We answered "yes".&#160; Then she asked "why did you tell these boys that they kill babies in there".&#160; I answered "because they do".&#160; She said "yes I know they do but to tell the boys that".&#160; I said "they came around the bushes &amp; saw the pictures &amp; we told them the Truth".&#160; That's what we do.&#160; I&#160;&#160;offered her a packet of literature &amp; she said "no, that's okay".&#160; I said I have a DVD that talks about Black Genocide".&#160; She said in a hurried voice "give me all that you got".&#160; I did.&#160; I forgot to mention that during all of this going back &amp; forth, with Mara &amp; I, she was on her cell phone.&#160; Talk about&#160;multi tasking!&#160;&#160;&#160;There was a little girl with the woman &amp; 2 boys who was as cute as a button &amp; she was taking the literature from me to give to her Aunty.&#160; She waved good bye to me as they were driving away.&#160; She melted my heart.&#160;</font></strong></div>

They must be losing business for this to happen. &#160;There was a man, with red pants on,&#160;walking across the street, &amp; he hollered over to us saying "life begins at conception".&#160; I was floored&#160;to hear this,&#160;for this&#160;man showed such wisdom.&#160; I said that Planned Parenthood kills babies &amp; he said "that's wrong".&#160; We agreed.&#160; I asked him to pray for Planned Parenthood.&#160; He was so refreshing.&#160; Then there were the rude guys,&#160;&#160;fixing the roof of Planned Parenthood, making comments.&#160; Mary S. &amp; I ignored them, for some of them probably lost a child, through their girlfriends or wives abortions.&#160; How sad!&#160; One of the guys came out of the parking &amp; he burned rubber as he left.&#160; Just tell me that he's not hurting.&#160; A woman, gave me her finger, as she was driving by, on the street.&#160; I just&#160;called out to her to repent,&#160;for her abortion.&#160; </font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">Mary S. had to leave &amp; she felt badly for she had to go back to work.&#160; I stayed there to witness the 'horrors of abortion'.&#160; About 20 minutes later a young girl was walking down the street towards me.&#160; She said that she was there for some baby clothes.&#160; I said "you are the lady that called me for the baby clothes, if you could help me bring these things back, to the center, I will open up the Material Aid Room for you.&#160; She helped me pack up everything &amp; off we went to the center.&#160; Her mother-in-law was there, with 2 babies.&#160; A girl &amp; a boy.&#160; They spent about 30 minutes in the room being blessed with many nice things.&#160;The baby girl was crying so I told&#160;the mom, who was shopping, &#160;that I would feed her baby, which I did.&#160; She told me that I gave her a 10 week old plastic baby &amp; she still has it, from last summer.&#160; She&#160; said that she was coming out of Planned Parenthood, last year, &amp; told me that she wasn't&#160;there to have an abortion.&#160;Yeah!!&#160; Said that&#160;she will never go back to Planned Parenthood again knowing that they kill babies there.&#160; Good for you dear one. &#160;Now the other baby, that was here today, was threatened by his mother to abort him but the grandmother of this precious baby told her not to &amp; she didn't.&#160; The grandmother is practically raising the boy because the mother doesn't come around much.&#160; The grandmother is loving towards her grandchild &amp; is doing a great job with him.&#160; He's going to be a football player.&#160; He's a big boy &amp; so cute.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Just as they were leaving the doorbell rang &amp; it was John.&#160; I was surprised &amp; thankful.&#160; I asked him if he would go out to the Front Lines &amp; that I would be there with him in awhile.&#160; He said "yes" &amp; he took&#160;a sign &amp; the literature box with him.&#160; I was short with the Truth packets &amp; had to get one from my car.&#160; It looks like the pro lifer from yesterday gave away some packets, which is great.&#160; So I made up a few more &amp; went out to be with John, on the sidewalk.&#160;&#160;When I arrived, I noticed that the Death Escort was gone.&#160; She probably left when I left, when I went&#160;into the center,&#160;but she&#160;didn't realize that I was coming back.&#160; So now it was John &amp; I witnessing to 'life'.&#160; Just then I saw a woman with a young toddler, coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I called over to her that we had 'free' baby clothes,&#160;at our center, next to the yellow building.&#160; She was on the phone &amp; said that she would come over in a minute.&#160; She followed me into the Material Aid Room with her young son.&#160; I got to speak to her for a few minutes, as she was getting some things for her son.&#160; She was at Planned Parenthood for the Pill &amp; didn't like their attitude.&#160; Oh yeah!!&#160; She was married with 4 children so I gave her my friend Anne's number to call for Natural Family Planning.&#160; She said that she would call her.&#160; I hope so, for she was not impressed with Planned Parenthood.&#160; I gave her some literature about Black Genocide &amp; the Maafa: 21 DVD.&#160; She said that she had called for a Taxi &amp; that she needed to get back outside to see if they had arrived.&#160; As she was walking out, she noticed the Taxi Company that has an office, in the same place that we have our center.&#160; She asked if they could take her home.&#160; I went back into the center &amp; asked Tickabu, the owner of the Taxi service,&#160;if he could take her home &amp; he said that he would.&#160; I gave her one of their cards &amp; she was grateful &amp; off she went, a happier person.&#160; As I was walking back to be with John I noticed that the Taxi cab, that she had called earlier, had arrived.&#160; I told them that she was gone &amp; they asked if I was sure &amp; I said "yes, I'm sure that she was gone".&#160; They went into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood to turn around &amp; when they were leaving John offered them, for there were 2 men in the front seat, some information.&#160; They replied that they would &amp; John gave them a Truth packet.&#160; He then offered then the Maafa 21 DVD &amp; when he went to look for&#160;one, in the&#160; literature box, he found none.&#160; I said&#160;to them to wait &amp; I'll go &amp; get one for them.&#160; They said "okay" &amp; off I go back to the center to get the DVD.&#160; When I returned to the sidewalk John was talking to them &amp; I handed the man, on the passenger side, the DVD &amp; he thanked me&#160;&amp; off they went, better educated.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>I realized that we again had no more Truth packets so I told John that I was going back to the center to make up another.&#160; We must have given away about 7 packets out this afternoon.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; Just as I was coming back to the sidewalk there was Martha coming towards the center.&#160; I greeted her, for she has been sick &amp; I haven't seen her in&#160;a weeks time, way to long.&#160;&#160;Glad that she was feeling better now.&#160; She asked me if I wanted some coffee &amp; said that coffee doesn't like me but I'll go over to Mack's to get her a cup.&#160; She was grateful.&#160; I went over to Mack's store, next to our center, &amp; he made up a fresh cup of coffee, for our dear Martha.&#160; I got to talk to him &amp; he said that he would come to my place to help me do some work in my basement.&#160; He said that he was now closing at 5:30pm every day instead of 7:30pm,&#160;to work in a cleaning business in Brighton, cleaning offices.&#160; He has 2 full time employees for his business.&#160; He said that he was looking a part time person so I recommended John to him.&#160; They will connect soon to talk about this.&#160; I thanked him for the fresh coffee that he just made Martha &amp; off I go back to the sidewalk to give Martha her hot coffee.&#160; She said thank you &amp; then took a sip &amp; said "is there sugar in it".&#160; I said "yes, do you want me to get you more sugar"?&#160; She said "no".&#160; Okay Miss Martha.&#160; When I was in the store getting her coffee &amp; talking to Mack she said that she had talked to a nice young gentleman who stopped to talk to her &amp; John, on the sidewalk.&#160; He took the last packet &amp; was blessed with the information.&#160; Earlier I gave a packet to 2 guys walking down the street &amp; Rosaries &amp; the Maafa 21 DVD,&#160; I guess I need to call Father for more DVD's.&#160; We are blessed that Fr. burns all our hand out DVD's for out Ministry.&#160; Thank you Father for your generosity.&#160; &#160;Just then a car pulled up along the sidewalk &amp; parked by Buckpit &amp;&#160;a woman got out.&#160; The woman walked towards us, Martha, John &amp; I,&#160;who were on the sidewalk.&#160; I then recognized her.&#160; She was the lady who stopped at the protest,&#160;at the Unitarian Church on January 22nd., to talk to a fellow prolifer&#160;&amp; myself.&#160; We gave her some information &amp; my phone number &amp; she said that she wanted to protest Planned Parenthood when&#160;she could.&#160; We said that would be great.&#160; There she was today, what a surprise.&#160; She meet Martha &amp;&#160;John &amp; I&#160;then&#160;&#160;brought her into the center to show her around.&#160; Martha &amp;&#160;John came in about 10 minutes later.&#160; John had to go &amp; Martha &amp; I spent about an hour talking to her.&#160; She said that she will be back tomorrow at 1PM to protest outside &amp; to help out, inside the center, when needed.&#160; Praise God for His answer to prayer for more people to be with us on the Front Lines.&#160; After she left Martha &amp; I had supper &amp; then made up packets &amp; put baby clothes &amp; items away in the Material Aid Room.&#160;We left tired but blessed with all the new items that we just received, to give to those who are in need.&#160; Thank you Lord for the blessing, that we are blessed with, to bless others with.</strong> </font></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">It was about 4pm now &amp; I was expecting the 4 Elim Bible Institute girls to come, to help me out for 2 hours.&#160; Before they arrived Martha, Valerie &amp; I reviewed the afternoon together.&#160; The girls came &amp; I greeted them &amp; introduced them to Martha &amp; Valerie.&#160; I asked them to help me get the bags &amp; boxes out of&#160;my car, for the Second Hand store that we are blessed by, to furnish our center with wonderful baby clothes, toys, books, stuffed animals &amp; small items.&#160; Tucker was late today,&#160;he arrived about 20 minutes late.&#160; Valerie went back out to the front lines &amp; she was by herself, so I asked the Elim girls, to be with her until Tucker came.&#160; She sent 2 girls back, into the center, because they were not dressed properly to be out in cold weather.&#160; When they came in I asked them if they could work in the Material Aid Room for awhile, sorting out baby clothes.&#160; Just then&#160;Tucker arrived &amp; he went out to the front lines&#160;to meet Valerie &amp; to be with her for awhile.&#160; The other 2 Elim girls came back into the center.&#160; Just then the doorbell rang it was our client who chose life last year instead of abortion, she came with her pregnant girlfriend.&#160; Becki, our Elim girl, who had bonded with our client, last December,&#160;when she came in to show us her ultrasound pictures.&#160; She hugged her &amp; so did I.&#160;&#160;I introduced&#160;the 2 girls to the Elim girls &amp; to Martha.&#160; Later on I introduced them to Valerie &amp; Tucker.&#160; We are planning a 'Baby Shower' for them on March 17th. for one of the girls is due in early April.&#160; We were so excited in seeing them &amp; the planning of the party.&#160; Later on, after some hot chocolate &amp; cookies, the Elim girls had to leave.&#160; I invited&#160;our clients to go to the Material Aid Room to get some baby clothes for their sons.&#160; After awhile, for it was getting late &amp; darker, I became concerned that&#160;it would not be a good idea for them to take the bus home, so I asked Martha if&#160;we could take them home. &#160;She agreed &amp; we did.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">I arrived after the noon Mass downtown &amp; was hoping to see Martha there at the center when I got there but to no avail she was not there.&#160; I did a couple of things before I braved the Death Mill, by myself.&#160; Thank God that Suzanne arrived early today.&#160; She came a little after 1 instead at 1:30pm.&#160; I was so happy.&#160; We reviewed some things together before I realized that Martha wasn't coming &amp; I will be by myself out on the front lines.&#160; It was close to 1:30pm &amp; I went out with the Literature Box &amp; 2 graphic signs to witness &amp; to educate &amp; to pray, for the saving of the lives of God's children, from being chopped up in little pieces &amp; thrown away.&#160; Lord have Mercy on us!!&#160; As I was walking outside I saw Bill.&#160; Oh my!&#160; I forgot that Bill comes on Thursdays.&#160; He wasn't there last week so 'out of sight, out of mind'.&#160; I was glad to see him &amp; I waved to him.&#160; He can't hear very well, so I don't speak to him very much, from across the street, where he stands with a sign.&#160; I just knew that it was better to have 2 people there instead of 1.&#160;&#160;I wasn't there for very long when this incident happened.&#160;&#160;My back was turned towards the bushes, for I was&#160;looking for something in the literature box, when all of a sudden I felt an evil presence behind me.&#160; A car had stopped, in the street, &amp; he hollered something that is not worth repeating here.&#160; I did not turn around to give him any satisfaction &amp; prayed that he would continue his trip up the street &amp; not get out of his vehicle &amp; bash my face in.&#160;&#160;Thank you Lord for protecting me.&#160; That's why it's really best to have 2 or more pro lifers, on the same side of the street, praying &amp; witnessing.&#160; You are less of a target then.&#160; He saw&#160;one female, doing God's work, &amp; was miffed.&#160; He probably was a&#160;post abortive father.&#160;&#160;He is suffering with a great deal of pain.&#160; Just then the ADC Supply Company truck came out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; They worked, putting on&#160;a new&#160;roof&#160;at Planned Parenthood, for the last 3 weeks.&#160; I will look them up on Google &amp; send them some vital information regarding Planned Parenthood, where they received innocent blood $, from these evil doers.&#160;</font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha came back, after dropping mother &amp; child home on Main St. &amp; told me that she lived in a dump.&#160; She was pregnant, which I didn't know as I walked her into the center for clothes earlier.&#160; I went into the center to tell Suzanne &amp; she called, the client, to make an appointment&#160;for a pregnancy&#160;retest, on Tuesday.&#160; She said that she will come back to get another test at the Focus Center.&#160; When I was in the center to talk with Suzanne I was introduced to a friendly woman who was with her friend who was at the Account's office.&#160; Suzanne had spoken to her &amp; she introduced her to me.&#160; We walked out together for Martha was alone.&#160; I introduced her to Martha &amp; she said that she loved 'life' &amp; wanted to help out on the sidewalk here to witness.&#160; I said that would be great &amp; I hope that I can get you to counsel also in the center.&#160; Then a car drove in &amp; I became to call out to the people in the car that we can help them.&#160; She then seemed to realize that something was going on here &amp; I said that Planned Parenthood kills babies here.&#160; Her mouth dropped open, for she didn't realize that.&#160; We tried to calm her down.&#160; Just then a bicycle rode passed us &amp; turned around.&#160; He stopped his bike to tell us to "keep on doing what we were doing" &amp; that he knew that Planned Parenthood kills babies.&#160; I can't help but wonder if they killed his son or daughter, in the past?&#160; He smiled at us 3 women &amp; rode away.&#160; Then the woman who was with Martha &amp; I told us her story:&#160; When she was 19 she got pregnant &amp; her boyfriend told her to "go for an abortion" &amp; that he would pay for it.&#160; She didn't know what to do so she went to her grandmother's house, who lived in Jamaica.&#160; She went into the house &amp; told her grandmother about her situation.&#160; Her grandmother responded "no my child you will not have an abortion, we have never had abortion in this family &amp; you will not be the first".&#160; She said that she put her arms around her grandmother &amp; stayed with her until the baby was born then went back home to be with her mother.&#160; She then said that her son went back to Jamaica to be a&#160;pallbearer, at his great grandmother's funeral, for it was because of her that he was born.&#160; I cried.&#160; We gave her a hug &amp; she said that she will be back, on the sidewalk soon, to be with us to witness to 'life'.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">Today I saw at least 4 women coming out of Planned Parenthood&#160;, who had just had their&#160;innocent babies be &#160;killed.&#160; It's so hard to process this horror.&#160; Earlier&#160;I was walking out of the center &amp; saw a car pull out of Planned Parenthood, so as I was walking up the sidewalk I hollered to the car "they kill babies in there".&#160; The guy driving the car put up his thumb &amp; I then walked over to Martha.&#160; When I got to her she said&#160;that she thought that the car that just pulled out of the driveway had a woman in it that probably just had an abortion.&#160; I was sick to my stomach.&#160;&#160;The guy, who had just picked her up, is thinking that his problems are over but they just beginning.&#160; I hope that they repent.&#160; &#160;Martha &amp; I continued to pray &amp; to witness for awhile longer.&#160; I had to go back into the center to get more Truth packets &amp; when I got back to the sidewalk&#160;Martha told me what just had happened.&#160;&#160;&#160;She said that a woman came around the bushes &amp; said to Martha that she just had an abortion.&#160; Martha was taken back at this information &amp; said to her "how do you feel".&#160; The woman almost started to cry &amp; said that she was 2 months pregnant, &amp; that her 19 year old son was going to pick her up on Gibbs St..&#160; Martha was upset but handed her a Truth packet which the woman took &amp; off her went down the street.&#160; We were sad together.&#160; How can this be happening!&#160; We are sorry for the sins against you Lord.&#160; Please forgive us.&#160; Amen.&#160; </font></strong></div>

<div><strong><font size="4">I have had a real bad cold this past week.&#160; Ick.&#160; I decided to go today to be with Martha because Valerie called in sick with a sore throat.&#160; Sounds familiar.&#160; I needed to bring the baby clothes that I washed &amp; other things to the center &amp; I didn't want Martha to be by herself.&#160; When I arrived there was Martha &amp; Sara &amp; Frank.&#160; He came to look at our front door that doesn't close &amp; he said for us to let the Landlord fix it for the door really needs to be replaced.&#160; Lots of luck Frank.&#160; Sara was there to drop off some food for the 'Food Shelves', thanks so much Sara.&#160; She was nice enough to go out with Martha, on the sidewalk,&#160;to pray &amp; to witness, on the front lines.&#160; I was to stay in the center to put things away &amp; to wait for our client to come to get more baby items.&#160; The doorbell rang &amp; I answered it.&#160; Sara said that Martha was asking for the peanut butter sandwiches that I made for&#160;our lunch.&#160; I went to the refrigerator to get it &amp; some cheese &amp; bottled water.&#160; Anything for Martha.&#160; Sara said that she needed to go after that.&#160; I said "okay &amp; thank you".&#160; I felt badly that Martha was now by herself on the sidewalk but I needed to be in the center today.&#160; I trusted God to protect her, which He did.&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong><font size="4">I put some things away in the Material Aid Room &amp; then went into the office to do some paper work before our Elim girls come at 4pm.&#160; I decided to get the other peanut butter sandwich that I made for lunch &amp; was eating it at the desk when I looked up to see a woman walk into the office.&#160; I was surprised for I didn't hear the doorbell ring.&#160; I said to her "can I help you".&#160; She said "I'm looking for the pregnancy center".&#160; I said "you just found it".&#160; I then said "do you need a pregnancy test"?&#160; "Yes I do" was her reply.&#160; She then said to me, which was a shocker, that Planned Parenthood won't do a pregnancy test unless you are going to terminate the pregnancy.&#160; She said that she was just over there &amp; that's what they told her.&#160; I looked at her with such sadness &amp; I think she felt that way too.&#160; After the test I gave her a lot of information., a brochure on Margaret Sander &amp; the&#160;Maafa 21 DVD, to educate her.&#160; She said that she was on Yaz, birth control pill.&#160;&#160;I told her that there are many problems with that &amp; all contraceptives.&#160; She agreed that she never felt good taking it.&#160;&#160;I referred her to Anne Olek, friend &amp; Nurse&#160; Practitioner,&#160;who teaches Natural Family Planning.&#160; I gave her&#160;the phone number &amp; told her to call her for assistance.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; She thanked me for the information.&#160; I asked if she had some children &amp; she said that she had 2 children, so I guided her to the Material Aid Room, to get some children's clothes, which she did .&#160; She was grateful for all the help she received &amp; I was happy to give her the help that she needed.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;Just then Martha came in from outside &amp; was putting the signs&#160;away, in the center.&#160; We then sat down to talk.&#160; She said that she gave away 2 Truth packets &amp; the man down the street at the Printing Company came out of the building several times to tell Martha to be quiet.&#160; They are in bed with Planned Parenthood, for they do business there, so they have received 'Blood Money' from them.&#160; Maybe it's driving them crazy.&#160; A car&#160;drove passed&#160;Martha hollering out the window "their better off dead" to which Martha replied "you're not dead because your mother chose life for you".&#160; She really wanted to slug her.&#160;&#160; A car came out of Planned Parenthood, with a friendly driver, who was waving at Martha with his wife slumped down in the front seat, after her abortion.&#160; What a man!!!&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;We were talking when the doorbell rang, it was our Elim girls.&#160; Tonight we decided to have a sharing time, which we did for 2 hours.&#160; I won't expose any of their stories but only to say that I empathized with their 'life pains'.&#160; I love them &amp; hope the very best for them.&#160; I know that God is with them &amp; is using them in a powerful way, to help others, in life.&#160; What a gift they are to me.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; When it was my time, to share, I felt sick that that was my 'life'. God is a healing God.&#160; One of the girls suggested that we end the evening with prayer so we all held hands &amp; prayed to each other.&#160; We all went around to give each a big hug good bye &amp; off they went back to school.&#160; Martha &amp; I then ate supper together &amp; cleaned up.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;After she left I talked with the Taxi people about the Slum Lord &amp; how he doesn't do anything, for paying such expensive rent each month.&#160; We need to pray for him to change &amp; to fix up his leaky building, before we all get sick.&#160; Ten the owner of the Taxi business asked if I was interested in switching rooms.&#160; We get their room, to have our Material Aid Room&#160;&amp; they get our Material Aid Room to run their business in.&#160; Sounds like a plan!!</font></strong>&#160;</p>

Three young girls came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; one was our client.&#160; I brought them to the center &amp; gave one of the girls a pregnancy test &amp; spoke with her while the other 2 girls were in the Material Aid Room, picking out baby clothes, for our clients' 2 years od daughter.&#160; She is pregnant &amp; doesn't know if she is having a boy or a girl.&#160; I asked them why were they at PP &amp; one of the girls told me for a test.&#160; Which usually means a STD test.&#160; I told the girls NOT to go back to that awful place PP &amp; talked with them for awhile &amp; gave them more literature.&#160; They were happy when they left. I also gave them cany which they enjoyed.&#160; We keep in touch with our pregnant clients once a week, by Suzanne.&#160; I don't want them to go to PP, but to come to us for help.<br />

Baby clothes were given out.&#160; Noella came back to get some more things, for her granddaughter.&#160; Also, a mom came in and got bags of clothes &amp; toys &amp; small items.<br />

We had a blessed meeting with some new &amp; exciting ideas for the center's future.&#160; Now we must pray to see what the dear Lord wants for the Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; The two Elim students were working in the Material Aid Room when the doorbell rang.&#160; I got up to answer the door &amp; there was Noella.&#160; She needed to get some more baby clothes, for her granddaughter.&#160; I introduced her to the girls &amp; asked them to help her get some things for the little girl.&#160; Then I went back to the meeting.&#160; The other two Elim girls were working on the computer, putting in the names of our clients, in the database.&#160; We have serviced&#160;over a&#160;100 clients a year since we opened as a pregnancy center almost 5 years ago.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; The meeting ended in prayer.&#160; Then I spent some time reviewing the last weeks sharing session with the girls &amp; asked them if they were alright after that intense time.&#160; They said that they were.&#160; I shared that it was difficult for me to share what I've been through &amp; they suggested that I write out, on paper my feelings, or the itraumas that have happened to me in the past, to clear the air, so to speak.&#160; I said that I would try it.&#160; I love it when the wisdom of others is passed onto me.&#160; Thank you Holy Spirit.&#160; I gave them all a big hug &amp; as they were leaving, beautiful Becci came walking back to me to give me another big hug.&#160; I guess she thought that I needed it.&#160; She was so right.&#160; I hollered to them to be careful, for while we all were in the center, it had snowed pretty badly.&#160; They said back to me that they would be careful &amp; off they went into the night.&#160; I went back into the center &amp; Martha &amp; I had supper together &amp; reviewed the day.</font></strong>&#160;</div>

Myths re: abortion:</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1. Abortion is used in place of birth control.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2. The women who have abortions are selfish and don't care about <br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; children.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 3. Women who get abortions make the decision lightly.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 4. Abortion threatens children's health.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 5. Making abortion illegal will make it go away.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 6. Abortion is harmful to women's health.<br />
<br />
&#160;Benefits of abortion to women:</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">Problem of fetal rights laws--multiple women imprisoned for stillbirths <br />
blamed on exposing fetus to drugs/alcohol.</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><br />
Abortions at Strong Memorial Hosp. vs. at Planned Parenthood.<br />
SMH-limited OR time and space, more cumbersome, takes 4-5 hrs. Not enough help. Only 2 or 3 nurses/scrub techs who will do it--most not willing to stand up to terrorism (danger of flack). Planned Parenthood -could do 20/hr.!&#160; "I keep up-ing the ante. About 40/day now"&#160; (due to need<br />
and lack of providers). Working on getting resident training in abortions at <br />
PP.</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">Medical Students for Choice--created to address need for more providers <br />
(google for more info).</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">24 weeks viable-legal limit in NYS.&#160; Viable, but not necessarily good<br />
quality of life.&#160; Dr. Tiller could perform 3rd term abortions because of <br />
lethal fetal anomalies.<br />
<br />
Question from one of the pro-life ladies with us (They didn't know we were <br />
pro-life.)At what point do you (Rachael) consider a fetus to be a human <br />
being? Ans. "Can I pass? There's no easy answer to that. It's different for <br />
different people.<br />
&#160;&#160; ....My feeling is that it's all on a continuum, though the pro choice <br />
movement could never say that in a legal forum. I'd rather do an abortion at 6 weeks than 12 weeks.<br />
My line is viability. Then there should be equal rights, not until then." <br />
We offer all patients to see an ultrasound. Most want to see and have a <br />
picture.<br />
&#160;&#160; Jewish--fetus not considered a baby until a limb comes out.<br />
&#160;&#160; Bible--there's something in there about "quickening."<br />
<br />
Rochester is one of poorest cities in USA-hard to pay co-pays for birth <br />
control.<br />
<br />
Talked about a generation of young providers rising up in family medicine <br />
and family planning fellowships....bringing it back into academics, <br />
hospitals.&#160; Planned Parenthood offered to train a resident.<br />
As abortion is pushed to the side, so is contraception. Is embarassing how many women come for abortions because they lack basic info about <br />
contraception. OB/GYN residents are not even taught basic info about it.<br />
<br />
Fetal rights--Pregnancy is a risk. Fetal rights are coming to a place where <br />
pregnant women are the ones without rights. The Supreme Court decision against partial birth abortion was a huge change. Before that, women's <br />
health always trumped. Harder to stay vigilant and fight.<br />
<br />
Question from one of our pro life people:Do you have to file death <br />
certificates for aborted babies?<br />
Ans.--Yes, one must be completed for every abortion, even ectopic (in <br />
fallopian tubes).&#160; The info goes to the state. It makes me crazy!&#160; The <br />
woman's supposed to remain anonymous, but you have to give so much info, they could certainly figure out who she is: first 3 letters of first and <br />
last names, place of birth, zip code, medical history, # of abortions, name <br />
(of a 5-week old embryo?!)...<br />
<br />
Have to sign a consent and wait 30 days on Medicaid if you want your tubes tied.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">There was no parking spaces so I had to park on the street &amp; bring everything into the center from far away.&#160; I did a couple of things then was starting to bring the signs &amp; literature box outside when Mary S. came.&#160; She helped me bring things out &amp; then I went &amp; moved my car that was parked by a meter, my 26 minutes were up.&#160; I was glad that I didn't get a $35 parking ticket.&#160; Time flies.&#160; I then joined Mary S. on the front lines &amp; a few minutes later Donna came.&#160; About 20 minutes later we noticed a young girl, coming up the street.&#160; I went over to approach her &amp; asked if I could help her &amp; if she needed a pregnancy test or baby clothes, we could help her with that.&#160; She said "yes, I need a pregnancy test".&#160; I then said "come follow me into the pregnancy center where we can help you.&#160; Thank God that Melody came in early today so she was in the Material Aid Room making up packets.&#160; I lead the client into the center &amp; we did a pregnancy test &amp; then Melody counseled her &amp; gave her some children's clothes in the Material Aid Room, for her child at home.&#160; I knew that she was in good hands so I went back to the sidewalk to be with Mary S, &amp; Donna.&#160; I wasn't there for very long when a young girl was walking up the street with a sweet little girl around 2 years old all dressed in pink.&#160; Valerie called her over &amp; she walked over to us.&#160; I asked her if she would free baby clothes for her little girl or toys or books.&#160; She said "yes, that would be nice".&#160; So she followed me in to the center.&#160; Melody was in the Material Aid Room with our other client so I asked her if she could also help our new client.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; I left to go back to the front lines.&#160; About 10 minutes later the young mom came out with her daughter &amp; as she was getting closer to us I asked her why she was going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that her sister was there, that she's been there all morning.&#160; I asked for what.&#160; She answered.&#160; She's hear for an abortion.&#160; I tried to talk her out of it but she wouldn't listen &amp; I'm sad about that, &amp; I know that she will have problems now.&#160; I said "yes she will &amp; we can help her for we have post abortion information in the center".&#160; I then said to her, "you're not diving so how can you be picking her up"?&#160; She said that she was suppose to come&#160;to Planned Parenthood&#160;&amp; that the aunt was going to pick us all up.&#160; I then said to her "thank you for giving your precious daughter life".&#160; She said that she had her daughter when she was 17 years old.&#160; I again said that if you had had an abortion this beautiful little girl would not be here.&#160; She said "I know".&#160; She said that it's not always easy but she is the joy of my life.&#160; Amen to that!!!&#160; She then went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; Just a few minutes later I saw her walking up the street towards Main.&#160; I guess that the aunt had picked up her sister already.&#160; I hope &amp; pray the very best for her &amp; her daughter &amp; healing &amp; God's forgiveness for her sister.&#160; There were pick ups of women who had abortions earlier this morning.&#160; How sad to see this, knowing that the baby has been killed, by Rachael Phelps the abortionist, in Planned Parenthood.&#160; It is a terrible feeling, a feeling of hopelessness &amp; grief, for both mother &amp; child.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">A car was entering the parking lot of Planned Parenthood &amp; I was saying that "we&#160;can help you" &amp; the young woman gave me the bird.&#160; It is a terrible gesture either done by a man or a woman.&#160; A woman doing it just degrades her but I'm not to happy about the implications.&#160; This gesture is a 'rape' gesture &amp; it is to shame you &amp; make you feel uncomfortable, which should be how the one that does it should feel.&#160; It is a gesture of anger.&#160; After she got out of the car she walked over to me &amp; started in with me.&#160; I told her that I didn't appreciate her mean gesture that she gave me.&#160; She then started to tell me all the wonderful things that Planned Parenthood does.&#160; I told her the opposite.&#160; She then said that she was here for rape counseling &amp; I told her as I looked her right in her eyes that I an a gang rape survivor &amp; that I wouldn't come here for counseling &amp; that she deserved better.&#160; I told her that I had some referrals for her but she refused to listen.&#160; I said what I said then she told me to .....&#160; ... which is another rape connotation.&#160; Boy at the end of this encounter I felt pretty bruised to say the least.&#160;&#160;As she was walking away to go into Planned Parenthood, I told her that I cared about her.&#160; She turned around &amp; said something to me, I don't know what it was.&#160; Then I told her that she was "my sister &amp; that I wanted the best for her".&#160; I started to cry after she went into&#160;Planned Parenthood but&#160;I couldn't grieve for very long for there was still more people to try to help.&#160;</font></strong></div>

<div><strong><font size="4">Donna &amp; Mary S.&#160;had to leave&#160;so there was Valerie &amp; I manning the fort.&#160; A woman was coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I started to talk to her.&#160; She said "stop harassing me".&#160; I said that "I had a Constitutional right to peacefully protest".&#160; As she was leaving, I told her to look at the pictures of the aborted babies, that we have on the sidewalk.&#160; A reality check to what Planned Parenthood does to people, in the name of 'chose".&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">I was talking to Valerie, a very interesting person, one with much knowledge, &amp; there was Mary &amp; Scott walking towards us.&#160; I know remembered that I had a 4pm appointment with them to possibility put up some shelves in the Material Aid Room. I asked Valerie if she was comfortable to be by herself &amp; she said that she would be fine.&#160; I said that I would be back.&#160; It took longer than I thought. The doorbell rang about 20 minutes later &amp; it was Valerie saying that she had to go.&#160; I said "I'm sorry that I took so long &amp; thank you &amp; I'll see you tomorrow.&#160; She said "okay".&#160; </font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">Scott &amp; Mary offered to help me put away the signs &amp; I asked them if they could stay with me out here for a few minutes longer.&#160; They said that they could.&#160; Just then a red truck pulled out &amp; 2 girls were in the truck.&#160; The driver was hollering at me saying "you don't know why I'm here".&#160; I said that they do abortions &amp; that any reason to be hear is not good.&#160; I then said to her not to come back.&#160; She was upset at me to say the least.&#160;Less then a minute later they turned around &amp; were coming back.&#160; As they were re entering the parking lot the driver hollered to me "I'm coming back now to have the abortion".&#160; How sick!!&#160; I knew that the abortionist had left about 15 minutes earlier but one never knows there at Planned Parenthood.&#160; As they were getting out of the car I asked them if they were suffering from Post Abortion Stress Syndrome?&#160; They had smiles on their faces as they went back into the killing mill.&#160; After they went in Mary &amp; Scott said that they had to leave &amp; Martha wasn't there yet so I decided to just wait for the girls to come out &amp; try to give them some information &amp; the Growth &amp; Development DVD.&#160; I was just waiting to try to make amends.&#160; About 15 minutes later Martha arrived &amp; she told me the reason she was late was because her patient was admitted to the General Hospital she had to go there today rather than her apartment on East Ave.&#160; I was glad to see her.&#160; She went into the center &amp; I thought that she was coming back outside but she stayed in the center with Melody.&#160; I was determined to stay out there until the 2 girls came out &amp; I could reason with them.&#160; They were in there for a whole about 20 minutes until they finally came out.&#160; As they were driving&#160;passed the bushes towards the street&#160;I said to them "please take this information".&#160; The driver said to me "why are you here bothering people they have a right to choose".&#160; I said that it was a death chose &amp; that they kill babies in there.&#160; It didn't seem to bother her for I think that she felt that women have the 'right to choose' to have their babies killed,&#160;which is nonsense.&#160; I offered the information again &amp; said to them both that I cared.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that they didn't make me an excuse to come back to start killing their baby by the RU 486 method of death or they were pulling my chains.&#160; I leave them up&#160;to the grace of God.&#160; Sometimes I feel so paralyzed out there, on the front lines&#160;&amp; guilty&#160;because of something I said that might make her go in to have the abortion.&#160; I, though the grace of God, want to save lives, not be responsible for taking lives.&#160; Lord have Mercy on your suffering servant.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Then A car pulled up on the other side of Planned Parenthood &amp; out of the car was Francis &amp; 2 other people with him.&#160; They came to pray the Rosary so now Jerry had some people to pray with.&#160; They blessed the center with $21.00 between all 3 of them&#160;for&#160;work of the center.&#160; How very nice of them &amp; thank you so much.&#160; Valerie had to go so we said good-bye to her.&#160; I then noticed that the girls came out of the center so I &amp; Leanne started to walk toward the center.&#160; Martha was coming out of the door &amp; I introduced her to Leanne, as she was headed to the sidewalk.&#160; I was very glad that she wasn't along out there, for there was 4 other people with her.&#160; I brought Leanne into the center to show her around.&#160;&#160;While she was there the doorbell rang &amp; it was&#160;Cleveland asking for Ramon noodles.&#160; I went to&#160;my car trunk to get him 2 packs, he was happy with that. I came back in &#160;She was impressed with the center &amp; it's work.&#160; I spent about 45 minutes with her before she had to leave.&#160; I hope that she comes back to be apart of the team.&#160; I went back out side to be with Martha for the 3 prayerful people had to go after they said the Rosary.&#160; We spent some time out in front of the abortion mill.&#160; I was so glad that the abortionist Rachael Phelps wasn't there killing babies today.&#160; It was bad enough to see the president, ceo of Planned Parenthood, James Stewart, along with his side kick Rick Bartell, driving in &amp; out of the killing mill.&#160; I guess they went to many lunches today.&#160; Fat cats!!&#160; Martha &amp; I went back into the center around 3:45 for our 4 Elim Bible Institute girls were coming at 4 &amp; I hadn't eaten lunch yet.&#160; So I grabbed my peanut butter sandwich &amp; ice tea &amp; gobbled it down before they came.&#160; Martha had a ham sandwich on the sidewalk earlier.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">The doorbell rang at 4 pm &amp; there were our girls, ready to come to help us in the center. I had some projects for them to do.&#160; One was to put away children's clothes &amp; small items, that&#160;we were blessed with from my friend at the second hand store, in East Rochester, for the Material Aid Room.&#160; Second was,&#160;working on the database, putting in information regarding our clients.&#160; I keep them very busy for the 2 hours that they are with us.&#160; What a blessing they are to us.</font></strong>&#160; <strong><font size="4">Thank you Lord!!</font></strong></p>

<div>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Martha had called me to tell me that she was sick &amp; Bill called me to tell me that he&#160;had to give his grandson his van to take to work today,&#160;so I knew that I was going to be by myself, on the front lines today.&#160; I went to Mass, at Our Lady of Victory &amp; I saw Paul, &amp; after Mass I asked&#160;him if he could come out with me, on the front lines.&#160; He said that he would&#160;but first he'll go to Wendy's&#160;&amp; get us some hamburgers, for lunch.&#160; I said that sounded like a plan.&#160; I went over to the center &amp; did a couple of things, like clean the Ladies Room, for it was a mess.&#160; Then the door bell rang, it was Sandy, she came in to wait for Suzanne, our Thursday counselor,&#160;to be orientated by her,&#160;to be a counselor on Tuesdays, at the Focus Center.&#160; &#160;A few minutes later Suzanne came in &amp; I went out to the street to sidewalk counsel.&#160; I was by myself for a very short time when Paul arrived with 2 hamburgers &amp; a ice tea, for later, so I wouldn't faint out there, for I don't eat lunch, I come right after Mass around 1pm.&#160; It was good that he was with me.&#160; It was now 1:20pm &amp; the abortionist Rachael Phelps car wasn't in the parking lot, nor was anyone else.&#160; I though for a minute that maybe they were closed for the afternoon or better yet permanently.&#160; The parking lot was empty until around 1:40pm when a mother &amp; daughter pulled in &amp; went into the killing mill.&#160; I spoke to them &amp; the daughter who was following her mother turned around at me.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she wasn't going for an abortion.&#160; The abortionist wasn't there but maybe another abortionist was &amp; had parked their car in the back parking lot.&#160;</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Then a guy, in a truck, came into the parking lot &amp; got out &amp; lit up a cigarette.&#160; I told him that you can't smoke in Planned Parenthood but you can kill a child in there &amp; told him that this was an evil place. &#160;He said to me "you talked to me last week when I was here".&#160; Oh Lord, you know why he was here last week &amp; is here again this week.&#160; He went in &amp; came back out by himself &amp; left.&#160; About an hour later he came back &amp; picked up a woman.&#160; Maybe the abortionist was here this morning &amp; he was now picking her up.&#160; How sad.&#160; Just then Jerry our long time pro lifer prayer warrior came to pray with Paul, that was great.&#160; I was witnessing with the graphic signs to the people driving by &amp; going in.&#160;</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>There was a couple that pulled in &amp; parked not to far from where I was standing by the fence.&#160; I showed them the picture of the precious aborted baby &amp; called over to them to offer them help &amp; information.&#160; The woman in the car, who was the driver, screamed over to me to shut the ..... up &amp; he reached over her to holler to me to "get a job".&#160; I told them both that "it was my fundamental Constitutional right of freedom of speech &amp; that they couldn't take that away from me".&#160; I spoke to them again &amp; she hollered, over to me,&#160;"I have a 3 month old".&#160; Okay I thought, this could be either or.&#160;&#160; One, she is going in there for birth control, or second, she already has a baby &amp; doesn't want another one, so is going in for an abortion.&#160; Both are bad.&#160; She got out of her car with a drink container so I think that it was the first scenario.&#160; For you can't drink anything before an abortion.&#160; So I decided to talk to the husband/ boyfriend, not sure which, I only know that he wasn't working either that afternoon.&#160; He literally stayed in the car for 2 hours.&#160; Sometimes you have to wait in there for a long time, since they're probably laying off people, due to the economy.&#160; Another car drove in &amp; 2 young girls came out of the car &amp; went in.&#160; The guy in the car stayed in the car.&#160; I spoke to both guys, that were waiting in their cars, on how men were suppose protect, love, support &amp; take of women &amp; children.&#160; Where are the good men, where have they gone???&#160;&#160; Don't know what has happened. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>I had to now, eat my 2 hamburgers, for I was getting weak.&#160; I still counseled as I ate, I was just careful not to do it at the same time.&#160; I think that I gave away 1 packet today. &#160;I brought no one into the center, for Suzanne, to counsel or do a pregnancy test or to give away baby/children clothes.&#160; Hopefully next week.&#160; The guys that were praying, on the sidewalk, had to leave a little after 3pm &amp; I could only stay until 4pm, for I had a commitment.</strong></font></p>

It had brand new cupboards, a&#160;granite like counter space, a floor that was&#160;gorgeous, a&#160;microwave &amp; a small stainless steel refrigerator too.&#160; There I go again, with my heart's desire plea.&#160; But, the most important function,&#160;was that it was a place of hope, healing &amp; life&#160;saving&#160;work.&#160; Not the decorations, for they were so right on, but the love &amp; help, that the clients receive,&#160;was the sole purpose of the center.&#160; I spoke with the Director for&#160;awhile &amp; obtained so much&#160; information, for our work, at the Focus Center.&#160; It was such a blessed evening. &#160;Thank you Kristen, you're doing a great job!!&#160; After I left I had to go to St. Cecilia's&#160;Rectory, to pick up the DVD's that we pass out, to the people that need them, for educational purposes.&#160; The storm was coming, for after my visit in the church, the snow was now coming down big time.&#160; I got home safe &amp; sound.&#160; Thank you Lord.</font></strong>&#160;</p>

Vinny Panepinto, at Our Lady of the Americas Church on E. Main St. today, to thank him for saving a precious life 25 years ago.&#160; Thank you Lord that you used Fr.Vinny, to save the life of this nurse, who is now helping others, by her work.&#160; The mother has no regrets in her life,&#160;but has joy, for she gave life.&#160; Thank God that the mother 'chose life' that day because God sent her a priest, with the truth.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">At Mass this afternoon I asked Jerry if he'd be with me on the front lines today because Mary S. is in Florida &amp; Donna is in Indiana.&#160; I would be by myself until Valerie gets there at 2:15pm.&#160; He said that he wasn't sure, so&#160;off I go, after Mass to the front lines, trusting in God.&#160; I went to the center &amp; did a couple of things &amp; then the doorbell rang &amp; it was Sandy.&#160; She is our new counselor on Tuesday afternoons.&#160; I orientated&#160;her with a couple of things &amp; then I went out to the front lines by myself.&#160; I was happy to see that the abortionist wasn't there.&#160; Praise God&#160;for that.&#160; I still can't trust Planned Parenthood, in that they are not killing babies, for I mustn't ever have my guard down.&#160; I was standing on the sidewalk counseling to mostly a deaf crowd, so sad.&#160; I must always realize that this is God's battle not mine &amp; I'm </font></strong><strong><font size="4">just His instrument,&#160;in this fight.&#160;&#160;God is in control.&#160; At least they hear the truth &amp; sometimes it takes a while for them to realize it.&#160; Hopefully they are questioning&#160;what they are doing with their lives &amp; the consequence to their&#160;sins.&#160;&#160;We must never give up because we may be reaching more people by our presence &amp; words, through the grace of God, than we realize.&#160; The Death Escorts, Barry Swan &amp; Linda Mock, the two old timers, were there doing their evil thing.&#160; Then I saw the next door neighbor of Planned Parenthood, Katherine, walk out of Planned Parenthood, with her&#160;one dog.&#160; She is so much in bed with Planned Parenthood.&#160; Fourteen years, of not getting through to her, about respecting life &amp; not taking life.&#160;&#160;She is a mess, that's all I can say, but we need to always pray for her soul.&#160;It's a nightmare for me out there sometimes, or I should say mostly.&#160;&#160;</font></strong>

<p><strong><font size="4">A few minutes later a car pulled out of Planned Parenthood &amp; I said that we wanted to give them some information.&#160; They stopped their car in the middle of the street &amp; Valerie went over to the car &amp; gave them a Truth packet &amp;&#160;a Maffa 21 DVD.&#160; I offered them a pregnancy test &amp; they said that they needed one.&#160; I said "come &amp; follow me".&#160; I lead them to the Focus Center &amp; assisted one of the girls with&#160;a pregnancy test.&#160; She said that she was doing a report &amp; I gave her some more information about many subjects, plus the&#160;Truth packet.&#160;&#160;After the test I asked her if she had any children &amp; she said that she did, so I lead her to the Material Aid Room where she was blessed with many nice things.&#160; She was so excited &amp; took about&#160;2 full bags of things.&#160; Great.&#160;&#160;She told me that she wanted to volunteer at the center, so I gave her my name &amp; phone # &amp; email&#160;address, &amp; said&#160;for her to give me a call if she was still interested.&#160; Sometimes the girls are so excited that they want to be a part of the center then they don't call.&#160; We understand.&#160; Maybe she'll be different, I don't know yet.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">As she was leaving &amp; went back outside &amp; Pat followed me.&#160; We stayed in the parking lot to talk for awhile &amp; then Valerie came on over to join us.&#160; We all talked for awhile &amp; I then said good bye to Pat &amp; gave her a big hug &amp; went back to my post on the sidewalk.&#160; Valerie was still talking to her about the evils of corn syrup, in the baby formula, that the Focus Center just bought for little Akira.&#160; It was between them now.&#160; Valerie is very careful for what she puts in her mouth &amp; I respect that.&#160; I don't necessarily follow that but I do respect her way of thinking, for I eat well but not as good as Valerie.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I was&#160;there, about 10 minutes, when a young girl came&#160;around the bushes &amp; I asked her if she&#160;needed any baby clothes.&#160; She said that she was&#160;pregnant &amp; that she had a young daughter&#160;at home.&#160; I said "come &amp; follow me" which she did.&#160; I introduced her to Melody &amp; Sandy &amp; they&#160; assisted her.&#160; I&#160;saw her come out later with 2 bags of clothes &amp; things,&#160;for her growing family.&#160; I earlier gave her a Truth packet too.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Valerie had to go &amp; Jerry had already left &amp; I wasn't expecting Martha until 5:30pm, for she was at work.&#160; Before Valerie left she asked me if I wanted her to&#160;bring in any of the&#160;signs &amp; I said "yes, the smaller ones"&#160;for her to put behind the bush in front of the center.&#160; I thanked her &amp; off she went.&#160; I decided to stay by myself until Martha showed up for it wasn't a cold day today &amp; I was fine.&#160; Don came walking by &amp; I spoke with him for awhile.&#160; Then the School Bus Driver came by &amp; honked, a good honk, at me.&#160; I was so grateful, for he&#160;is a steady honker, that I threw him a kiss.&#160; I hope that he didn't think that I wanted a date or anything, probably not.&#160; Nice&#160;man.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Then came the evil acting bozos.&#160; There I was standing holding my sign when a car with, some smart alecs, drove by.&#160; I ignored them &amp; then I&#160;heard something hit the tree.&#160; I know that they had thrown something at me but I didn't know what it was.&#160; Just then a guy pulled along side of me in his truck &amp; I thought, oh no I'm going to get it.&#160; But the&#160;opposite occurred.&#160; He stopped his truck &amp; said to me that he had found&#160;a packet of information up the street &amp; he thought that I would probably&#160;want it back.&#160; He handed me the packet &amp; I said to him "thank you so much, that was very nice of you to stop to give it to me".&#160; He smiled&#160;&amp; off he went.&#160; He turned his&#160;truck&#160;around &amp; as he passed by me I waved at him.&#160; I regained my faith in mankind.&#160; &#160;I was now curious to what was thrown at me earlier,&#160;so I walked over to see. It was a&#160;banana skin.&#160; At least these goofy guys ate good.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;I remember that years earlier, Officer Jim had a guy arrested &amp; he had to spend a night in jail &amp; had to go to court &amp;&#160;had to do 20 hours of community service, for throwing a container of pickles at me.&#160; He had gone to Wendy's earlier that evening &amp; got a&#160;hamburger &amp; a container of pickles.&#160; He ate the hamburger &amp; thrown the pickles.&#160; Should of eaten them both, son.&#160; I only can imagine what would happen to that young fellow if he had thrown his hamburger at me.&#160; He'd still be in jail perhaps.&#160; Officer Jim was very protective of us on the sidewalk.&#160; Those were the days when we got police protection, when the city could afford to pay the officers overtime, to&#160;be with us.&#160; Time's have changed &amp; not for the&#160;better either.&#160; The reason the Judge&#160;came down so hard on him was that he threw it at night &amp; it could have been something hard &amp; it could have hurt or killed me.&#160; It wasn't so much what he threw but that he threw something at someone.&#160; &#160; </font></strong></p>
</div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Just then I heard a car honking at me &amp; I looked up to see that it was Martha, it was only 4:45pm, she got there earlier than was&#160;expected from work.&#160; &#160;Yeah, always good to see Martha.&#160; I greeted her with a hug &amp; told her about the banana boys.&#160; She said "as long that you didn't slip on the banana peel, you'll be fine".&#160; It was the principle dear Martha.&#160; She was only trying to make me feel better with humor.&#160; Oh yea!&#160; Glad that it was only a banana for next time it might be an apple &amp; that would really hurt.&#160;</font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;She asked&#160;me if I wanted any coffee &amp; said "no thank you, coffee doesn't like me at all".&#160; So I said to her that I would go over to Mack's to get her a cup&#160;of coffee.&#160; She said "that would be nice". &#160;No problem&#160;dear Martha.&#160; I talked with Mack for a short time &amp; came back to the sidewalk with a cup of freshly brewed coffee for our sweet Martha.&#160; She told me, when I returned, that a woman gave her a finger &amp; stated to say nasty things to her.&#160; I asked Martha what she said that ticked her off &amp; Martha said that she was just standing there not saying a word &amp; holding a picture of Christ crying &amp; holding the precious aborted baby, in his hands.&#160; That was enough for this poor woman.&#160; The guilt was probably overwhelming &amp; you&#160;have to take it out on someone &amp; that was Martha.&#160; Glad that she was okay while I was gone for her special cup of Java.&#160; Enjoy it Martha.&#160; I then saw another woman drive in, with a precious child in a car seat, in the back seat of the van.&#160; There was a Rosary on the mirror of the car.&#160; My worst scenario, a child &amp; a Rosary.&#160; Lord have Mercy.&#160; She was in the parking lot waiting for a pick up.&#160; When she drove out it looked like it was her daughter that she picked up.&#160; I don't remember this vehicle earlier so I don't know how long that the daughter was in PP &amp; for what she was there for.&#160; I only hope she wasn't there for an abortion or birth control, they both kill children.&#160; I wish that the mothers would be more responsible to their daughters.&#160; What is happening dear Lord??&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">The girls have arrived &amp; we decided to discuss the Baby Shower, that was 2 weeks away.&#160; The center will get the food, drinks, cake &amp;&#160;decorations.&#160; We will get some presents &amp; have some games to play.&#160; It will be a good time.&#160; Just then the doorbell rang &amp; it was Melody, who works in the Material Aid Room, on Tuesdays.&#160; She came to talk to Becki regarding singing, which they both can do very well.&#160; Their meeting went very well.&#160; I asked the 3 other girls if they would straighten out the Material Aid Room, which they did in such a great way.&#160; It looks so organized, in the room now.&#160; Great job girls!&#160;&#160; Martha came in &amp; Tucker had to go.&#160; Jerry left awhile ago.&#160; Before he left Tucker told me that a guy in a car had stopped &amp; told them he didn't like the signs &amp; that they should go.&#160; He didn't mind the benign signs but the other signs were giving his kids nightmares, for&#160;he drives down&#160;University Ave. every day.&#160; He was&#160;hollering.&#160; Tucker replied "you think that your kids feel bad just think how these kids, that were aborted, felt like".&#160; Off the guy goes down the street, madder than a wet hen.&#160; They just don't get it.&#160; </font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">The doorbell rang &amp; it was Israel.&#160; She had brought some beautiful hand made signs with positive messages on them.&#160; Thank you Israel.&#160; After the 4 precious Elim girls &amp; Tucker had left, Martha, Israel &amp; I ate supper together, then we did some more work in the Material Aid Room.&#160; We also cleaned up, the mess in the hallway, from the leaky pipe&#160;&amp; then&#160;went home.&#160; Thank you Lord for all the blessings that we received from you this afternoon.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<div>
<p><strong><font size="4">I recruited Paul &amp; Jerry after Mass today, to come with me to the Front Lines.&#160; Paul again said that he would go to Wendy's first to get me 2 hamburgers for my lunch.&#160; How nice.&#160;As I was leaving&#160;church I started to talk to a young man who has been coming to weekday Mass regularly.&#160;I invited to come to pray in front of Planned Parenthood &amp; he said how about now.&#160; His name&#160;is John &amp; I&#160;am happy to have met him. I gave him a ride to the center &amp; orientated him real fast.&#160;&#160;When we got&#160;to the center, Bill was there on the sidewalk, across the street from Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was hoping to see Martha but she wasn't there yet.&#160; I was hoping that she was okay &amp; would be there momentarily.&#160; I was wrong.&#160; I went into the center to get the signs &amp; the mega phone &amp; the literature box for the fight ahead.&#160; I saw that the abortionist Rachael Phelps was there so I knew that she was killing children here today.&#160; As I was thinking this a car pulled out of the parking lot with the girl slumped down in the front seat, so I knew that this was the first fatally of the day, for my eyes to see.&#160; Very upsetting.&#160; I was happy to see that Jerry was now coming down the street towards me &amp; I knew that I would be having prayer power now.&#160; A few minutes later there was Paul coming down the street &amp; he stopped to hand me my bag lunch &amp; then he parked his car &amp; got out &amp; joined Jerry in prayer.&#160; I was still worried about Martha for she wasn't there yet.&#160; She finally did come about 1 hour later, so got tied up with unexpected phone calls that made her late.&#160; As long as she was okay that's all that matters.&#160; I was a little snooty when she did come because I depend on her so much &amp; it is difficult for me to sidewalk counsel by myself.&#160; Before she got there the Insurance Agent came &amp; gave me the paper work for our Liability Insurance, for the Focus Center.&#160; I wanted to talk to him in the privacy of the center but Martha wasn't there yet so I couldn't leave my post &amp; I&#160;had to talk to him &amp; sidewalk counsel , at the same time.&#160; Very difficult!&#160; He understood &amp; was gracious.&#160; I still spoke to every car that pulled into this 'Hell Hole' of a place, where they murder babies, in cold innocent blood.&#160; He explained our coverage briefly &amp; I thanked him for all his help, in getting a reasonable policy, for our Focus Center.&#160; He good bye &amp; left.&#160; I felt frazzled.&#160; I was certainly glad when Martha did arrive on the sidewalk safe &amp; sound.&#160; She said hi &amp; then she&#160;said the Rosary along with Jerry &amp; Paul &amp; our new recruit, John.&#160; When our Thursday counselor arrived, on the sidewalk before she goes into the center she said "hello Mary, hi John".&#160; What, you mean Suzanne knows John.&#160; She said to him "your friends were here last week".&#160; Wow you know them too.&#160;&#160;Small world!&#160; I spoke with Suzanne briefly about some things to do in the center &amp; off she goes into &#160;the center.&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">Just then a car drove in with a man &amp; a woman in the car.&#160; The man who was driving gave me the 'rape symbol' with his finger.&#160; As the woman was getting out of the car I said to her "your husband just gave me the 'rape symbol' how sad.&#160; She went into the Planned Parenthood &amp; came out a few minutes later along with two young girls.&#160; I said to them "I hope that you didn't have an abortion".&#160; They both repeated what their father did to me earlier.&#160; Like father like daughters.&#160; I spoke to this broken family as they drove out.&#160;&#160;I said " You will suffer until you repent. I hope that you didn't allow your daughters to kill your grandchildren, repent".&#160; I hope &amp; pray that this family realizes, real soon, what they did &amp; repent.&#160; Question: How to destroy a family.&#160; Answer: abortion.&#160; </font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">Another great report on the front lines.&#160; Miracles are happening out there.&#160;Just want to share with you. A woman came around the bushes &amp; she was on the phone.&#160; She was trying to say good bye to her mother &amp; finally hung up.&#160; I asked her what she was doing at Planned Parenthood &amp; she told me that was pregnant &amp; was getting information to have an abortion.&#160; She said that she has 5 children &amp; really doesn't know the father of her baby that she is pregnant with.&#160; I said that you are pregnant with baby # 6 &amp; the only choice you have is either to raise this baby or to give this baby up for adoption.&#160; I said "you shouldn't be here at Planned Parenthood".&#160; Then she said "my mother doesn't want me here either".&#160; "Your mother is right on" I said.&#160; Then she landed me a whopper.&#160; She said that she was here for an abortion 8 years ago &amp; she said&#160;we were here, on the sidewalk,&#160;&amp; told her not to do it &amp; she didn't &amp; her son is 8 years old now.&#160; I gave her a big hug.&#160; I said&#160; "you're not going to do now either" &amp; I gave her our Truth packet &amp; a DVD of the Growth &amp; Development, of the baby in the womb.&#160; She smiled &amp; said that she wasn't, for she was convicted again.&#160; I invited her to come into the center but she had to go.&#160; I said to her "if you need anything then please come to the center or call me" &amp; she said that she would.&#160; She went into the parking lot to get her car &amp; as she was leaving, I went up to her car, on the street,&#160;&amp; gave her our 12 week old plastic baby &amp; said "this is the size of your baby, in your womb, that God created &amp; he has a plan for your child"&#160; She smiled&#160;&amp; I said &#160;"by the way say hi to your mom, I really like you mom".&#160; She said that she would &amp;&#160;off she went, never to come back to this killing mill again.&#160; I'm so glad that we were out there again for her to 'choose&#160;life'.&#160; Praise God for this precious baby to be saved, by the grace of God.&#160;&#160;It's real cool, for the Lord to let us know, that we have an 8 year boy, who was saved from being aborted.&#160; I know that he is happy to be alive.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<div>
<p><strong><font size="4">I can't tell you all went on because so much went on that it hasn't registered yet.&#160; Our counselor gave a pregnancy test to a mom with two children&#160;&amp; I was answering the door for a client that needed clothes for her son.&#160; She then shared that she was going into Planned Parenthood, for an abortion &amp; one of&#160;the people, on the front lines, talked her out of it.&#160; She said that her son in 17 months old now.&#160; Praise God!&#160; She was grateful for all that she received, for her son, at the Focus Center's Material Aid Room.&#160; We are glad to help out this mother that 'chose life'.&#160; We had a nasty guy walking down the sidewalk along with his friend.&#160; A woman who was in the parking lot of Planned Parenthood recognized these two people &amp; walked over to them with her baby, in her arms.&#160; I spoke to them of what was going on in Planned Parenthood &amp; one of the guys said "yeah, this is a late term abortion" &amp; laughed, as they were walking her into the parking lot, to get her car. &#160;I told him that he was a sick wimp &amp; no real man would talk like that.&#160; What kind of a woman would want a person like that around her &amp; her precious baby?&#160; That poor baby to be around people like that &amp; I mean his or her mother.&#160; She carried a big smirk on her, red haired, face.&#160; What's wrong with people today.&#160; Do they have no feelings.&#160; I only hope that they all reflected on&#160;their bad behavior today at the Killing Mill.&#160; Tony was with me when this happened &amp; Jerry was praying by the brick side of the building, which is the front, with the signs on the tree.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I had to go back &amp; forth into the center to inform Suzanne of different things because one of our new mothers was coming to receive a car seat with 2 bases &amp; a stroller &amp; a bassinet.&#160; Also, I asked Suzanne to call our 2 new clients, of this past week, to see how they were doing &amp; to see if they needed any help.&#160; One of our clients boyfriend&#160;thought that it was Planned Parenthood calling &amp; he told them that they had changed their minds, until Suzanne reassured the boyfriend, that it was the Focus Pregnancy Help Center that was calling, to see how the mom was doing.&#160; He was relieved.&#160; They talked for awhile &amp; Suzanne stressed the value of marriage to him.&#160; We'll have to wait &amp; see if he heard the 'message'.&#160; We might be going to a wedding this summer.&#160; Never know.</font></strong>&#160;</p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I was out on the front lines when Suzanne hollered, up the street, that our client was here.&#160; She was here, with her new baby, to pick up the items that we had for her.&#160; I walked to the center's parking lot &amp; there she was.&#160; I went over to her &amp; gave her a big hug.&#160; I looked in the car &amp; there was our sweet little boy sleeping along with his big brother who is 4 years old, in the back seat of the car.&#160; My heart was touched &amp; as I looked at him &amp;&#160;all I could think was, that this is the same baby that was in her womb, when she was going to Planned Parenthood, to get an abortion.&#160; I was rejoicing that she 'chose life'.&#160; Praise God!!!&#160; Her boyfriend thanked me &amp; so did our sweet girl.&#160; I told to call me if she&#160;needed anything &amp; she said that she would.&#160; I gave her another hug &amp; off they went, on happy family.&#160; My heart sang.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I saw someone ringing our doorbell &amp; I went over to them.&#160; They said that they were here for some baby clothes.&#160;&#160;I saw Melody,&#160;in the corner of my eye, as she was walking down the sidewalk to join the 'Bound for Life' group that were forming across the street.&#160; She came right over to me &amp; I asked if she could go into the Material Aid Room to help our new clients.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; She &amp; they went into the center.&#160; As I was walking, to go back to the front lines, I noticed that someone else was at the door so I went back.&#160; The lady was here to get some baby clothes so I opened the door for her to go to the Material Aid Room&#160;to join the others.&#160; WOW!!!&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;I finally got back to the front lines to join the team, which was Martha, Jerry, Charles, Bill&#160;&amp; now the 'Bound for Life' group, there was four people.&#160; I went up to Brandon &amp; greeted him.&#160; His wife Crystal was our Monday evening counselor until she had baby number two.&#160; We spoke for a few minutes &amp; then he went back to join the others.&#160;&#160;They put red tape on their mouths that read 'LIFE' &amp; they stand across the street across from Planned Parenthood &#160;&amp; don't talk&#160;but pray for an hour.&#160; They represent the&#160;babies, that are aborted, that have 'no voice'.&#160; &#160;They touch my heart.&#160; Now there was Jane't &amp; her 3 friends now on the sidewalk.&#160; This looks so good to the public.&#160; I had to go across the street to give Brandon something &amp; as I was crossing the street a lady that was at the Vet's office stopped me.&#160; She said "can I ask you a question".&#160; I said "yes you can".&#160; She said that she was opposed to abortion &amp; that she had 2 children &amp; that her father was a Pastor.&#160; I said "that's great".&#160; She then asked "do you just protest &amp; don't&#160;help them once they change their minds".&#160; I said "are you saying that they should have an abortion if&#160;we don't&#160;help them"&#160; I think that I was being defensive.&#160; "Oh no" she replied, I told you that I was opposed to abortion, I just wanted to know if you help them too.&#160; I said "oh yes, we have a pregnancy center right across the street" &amp; I pointed to the center, in the corner of the strip mall.&#160; I asked her if she would like some information &amp; for her to follow me across the street to receive it,&#160;which she did.&#160; I handed her a Truth packet &amp; the Maafa 21: Black Genocide DVD, which she took.&#160; I introduced her to the group of people that were out in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I left her to do something else &amp; when I looked over she was praying with Jane't.&#160; Praise God for her openness to want to know more about what we were doing in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I know that&#160;her &amp; her father will make a difference in the Black community &amp; maybe bring their church down here to peacefully protest the evils of this racist Planned Parenthood, that murders God's precious creation.&#160; One person can make a difference!!!&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;I was now sidewalk counseling &amp; I hollered over into the parking lot that we had baby clothes, next to this big yellow building, next door.&#160; Just then a young girl came around the bushes &amp; said that she was pregnant &amp; needed some baby clothes.&#160; I said yes we have baby clothes in our center down the street a little ways.&#160; I asked her what she was doing there at Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that her grandmother &amp; her were picking up a friend that just had an abortion.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; Then there was the car coming around the bushes &amp; stopped to where we were standing.&#160; Then I saw a young girl walk from around the bushes &amp; that was the friend that just had the abortion, she got into the car.&#160; I&#160;said to the pregnant girl to follow me&#160;to the center &amp; I would give her some baby clothes.&#160; She followed me to the center &amp; her grandmother who was in the car drove into the parking lot of the center &amp; parked.&#160; I brought the young girl into the Material Aid Room to select what she wanted for her baby, in her womb.&#160; I said to her "you're not going to have an abortion, are you".&#160; She said "oh no I wouldn't do that to my baby".&#160; I said "that is great news,&#160;I just wanted to make sure".&#160; Then I went into the counseling room to get her a Growth &amp; Development, in the womb,&#160;DVD &amp; our little 12 week old plastic&#160;baby.&#160; I also got all the post abortion material, that&#160;I could put my hands on, plus Kathy's phone number, for her friend to talk to when she gets out of denial.&#160; I handed this to her &amp; she thanked me.&#160; She got some things that were yellow &amp; green until he knows if she is going to have a little boy or girl.&#160; I gave her our brochure &amp; told her to call me if she needed anything.&#160; She said "thank you" &amp; left.&#160; I was so happy for her &amp; so sad for her friend, that will suffer greatly, for what she did at Planned Parenthood today.&#160; It will be very hard for them to remain friends as she gets bigger in her pregnancy.&#160; God is in charge.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">I then went back to be with my friends out on the front lines for solidarity.&#160; When I got back I spoke with Martha for her heart was heavy with what just happened.&#160; I love this woman for she is so dedicated out on the street &amp; in the center.&#160; She has a heart of gold &amp; is so good with the girls.&#160; She draws them to her &amp; then I do the&#160;follow up, usually.&#160; She is such a great help to me in the center when we have events there.&#160; Thank you Lord for all the dedicated remnant, that have served you for many years, &amp; will continue.&#160; After the hour was up the 'Bound for Life' group came over to us &amp; we all held hands &amp; said the Our Father prayer.&#160; Then we all hugged &amp;&#160;after some conversation we all said good bye.&#160; Martha, Jane't &amp; her 3 friends that she brought, Bill &amp;&#160;I went into the center to have our&#160;group&#160;meeting, that's based on the Bible.&#160; It went very well &amp; we were all blessed.</font></strong>&#160;</p>

<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Tuesday, March 16, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">What a day!&#160; I'll be truthful, so much happened &amp; so fast were things happening, I really don't think that I will remember everything that went on today, but I will do my best.&#160; All I can say was that it was all good &amp; so many mothers were helped.&#160; It all started when&#160;Martha &amp; I went to the center after Mass around 12:45pm.&#160; We started to do some things around the center when Sandy came in to counsel in the center.&#160; She helped me bring all the things that I had in my car.&#160; Then it was the cleaning the high chair with diluted Clorox water, for our client to take home with her, when she comes in.&#160; Her baby was born 6 weeks early &amp; is doing well &amp; will be coming home on Wednesday, he is over 4 lbs. now.&#160;Yeah!!&#160; Martha &amp; I went out to the front lines &amp; set up the signs &amp; there come Mary S. &amp; Donna.&#160; What a team!&#160; I was in &amp; out of the center.&#160; Then when I was out on the sidewalk there were 2 young girls with strollers.&#160; I stopped to talk to them &amp; they said that they will come over to the center after they get their STD testing.&#160; About 2 hours later they came out &amp; came over to the center to get baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; we are glad that she 'chose life'.&#160; She doesn't believe in abortion &amp; would not be talked into an abortion at Planned Parenthood though they tried.&#160; She said that they do abortions up to 13 weeks gestation.&#160; She over heard someone say that in Planned Parenthood.&#160; Oh my God how evil they are.&#160; Lord have mercy!!&#160; Another young girl needed baby clothes so Martha went into the center to help her.&#160; I stayed outside to counsel.&#160; Then along comes the male worker at Planned Parenthood checking out to see if anything of ours is touching the wooden base around the bushes.&#160; He stopped his car &amp; said "take your things off the base".&#160; Nothing was on it only a few signs were leaning against it.&#160; I said "have a nice day".&#160; He said "I'll be right over".&#160; He went to the back parking lot &amp; then went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told him later when he drove out that his priorities were all off.&#160; They are killing children in there where you work &amp; you do nothing &amp; all that you care about is our signs touching the base by the bushes".&#160; "You need help"&#160;I interjected.&#160; He drove away &amp; came back later &amp; didn't bother us but he will again, in the future.&#160; I went into the center to see that the drop off of things including a wooden high chair &amp; other nice things had arrived.&#160; I just missed the gentleman but I will call him later to thank him for all the nice things he brought to us.&#160; Dishes, vases, tea pot, coffee pot etc..&#160; How very thoughtful of him.&#160; As&#160;I was leaving I saw our client come in who just had her baby boy 6 weeks earlier.&#160; He was still in the hospital for she delivered early but is doing fine &amp;&#160;will be bringing&#160;him home in a few days.&#160; Little David Tobias.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; She received the wooden highchair that was just brought in as a donation &amp; the stroller we just received a few days ago.&#160; She also took some diapers, baby clothes &amp; other things &amp; was very happy to receive them.&#160; I gave her a hug good bye &amp; told her if she needed anything else in the future please call&#160;me &amp; she said that she would.&#160;&#160;I was thrilled to see her &amp; that she 'chose life'.&#160; I then went back outside to the front lines to be with Donna for Mary S. had to go back to work &amp; Martha wanted to stay in the center to help Sandy with the delivery that came in.&#160; I wasn't outside for very long when I lead a young girl into the center for a pregnancy test, she was going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; There she was in good hands with Martha &amp; Sandy, in the center.&#160; When I got back to the sidewalk there was the next door neighbor to Planned Parenthood Katharine Lynch walking down the sidewalk with her dog &amp; a young guy.&#160; I said to her "Katherine, don't have your dog pee on our signs".&#160; "O shut up"&#160;&#160;was her reply.&#160; Nothing changes.&#160; She then said "you don't own the sidewalk".&#160; I replied&#160; "either do you, your dog pees on my signs I'll call the police".&#160; The young guy said something but&#160;I didn't pay him an attention.&#160; This was between her &amp; I.&#160; As&#160;I was turning around to be more attentive at my post there was another young girl coming down the street.&#160; I stopped to talk to her &amp; said "come follow me".&#160; I brought her into the center for a pregnancy test &amp; counseling.&#160; Back to the street I go.&#160; I turned around &amp; there were 3 girls walking towards me.&#160; I recognized on of the girls in the middle &amp; it was our client who were going to have a Baby Shower for tomorrow on St. Patrick's Day.&#160; I went up to her &amp; gave her a big hug.&#160; The one girl with her was her sister &amp; the other girl was her friend.&#160; They had gone into the center to see me &amp; her&#160; friend had a pregnancy test.&#160; I was so glad to see her &amp; she is so excited about the Baby Shower tomorrow.&#160; I asked her to stay there for a few minutes, for&#160;I needed to go back into the center for a minute, for I needed to do something.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; When I came back I noticed that they all were talking to someone on the sidewalk.&#160; When I approached the girls I heard the woman that was talking to them was angry &amp; said that she was thing of having an abortion because things were not going well for her.&#160; I said something to her &amp; Donna said something to me in response.&#160; Then the woman said "she has her on opinion".&#160; I knew whatever I said for I can't remember was from the Holy Spirit, for I asked him to anoint my head, mouth, heart, hands &amp; feet, &amp; I know that he did.&#160; I quickly went to the literature box to get the Growth &amp; Development DVD &amp; handed it to her which she took.&#160; She then walked into Planned Parenthood &amp; I called over to her to tell her that we would help her in what she needed.&#160; I had to leave her to the dear Lord which will touch her heart, not to do this evil against her child &amp; herself.&#160; If she thinks that she has problems now just wait &amp; see what will happen after the abortion.&#160; I put her into the Blessed Mother's care like all the other girls.&#160;I know that the Lord used Donna &amp; also the 3 girls on the sidewalk with her.&#160; I was the last hurrah.&#160; I talked with the girls for a few minutes &amp; 2 of them shared that Planned Parenthood gave them pills to take, which they later found out, was the abortion pill RU 486.&#160; They both lost their babies.&#160; Planned Parenthood never told them what they were for only that they needed to take the pills,&#160;which being so young listened to them &amp; took the 'pills of death'.&#160; That was about 2 years ago.&#160; Through the grace of God,&#160;I stopped our client, as she was going into Planned Parenthood for an abortion, last year.&#160; She &amp; I &amp; baby are so glad that she 'chose life'.&#160; In a couple of weeks now she will be holding her little boy in her arms.&#160; Yeah!!!&#160; :)</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">As they were saying good bye two young girls came from behind the bushes.&#160; I asked if we could help them &amp; the one girl said that she was pregnant &amp; she had she ultrasound pictures with her.&#160; I offered some baby clothes in the center &amp; they followed me into the center to receive them.&#160; I told her that I was happy that she 'chose Life'.&#160; She said that Planned Parenthood tried to talk her into an abortion &amp; she said that she told them off &amp; left.&#160; Good for you my dear!!&#160; She was disgusted.&#160; </font></strong>
<div><strong><font size="4">Tuesday, March 16, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">What a day.&#160; I'll be truthful, so much happened &amp; so fast were things happening, I really don't think that I will remember everything that went on.&#160; All I can say was that it was all good &amp; so many mothers were helped.&#160; It all started when&#160;Martha &amp; I went to the center after Mass around 12:45pm.&#160; We started to do some things around the center when Sandy came in to counsel in the center.&#160; She helped me bring all the things that I had in my car.&#160; Then it was the cleaning the high chair with diluted Clorox water, for our client to take home with her, when she comes in.&#160; Her baby was born 6 weeks early &amp; is doing well &amp; will be coming home on Wednesday, he is over 4 lbs. now.&#160;Yeah!!&#160; Martha &amp; I went out to the front lines &amp; set up the signs &amp; there come Mary S. &amp; Donna.&#160; What a team!&#160; I was in &amp; out of the center.&#160; Then when I was out on the sidewalk there were 2 young girls with strollers.&#160; I stopped to talk to them &amp; they said that they will come over to the center after they get their STD testing.&#160; About 2 hours later they came out &amp; came over to the center to get baby &amp; children clothes.&#160; we are glad that she 'chose life'.&#160; She doesn't believe in abortion &amp; would not be talked into an abortion at Planned Parenthood though they tried.&#160; She said that they do abortions up to 13 weeks gestation.&#160; She over heard someone say that in Planned Parenthood.&#160; Oh my God how evil they are.&#160; Lord have mercy!!&#160; Another young girl needed baby clothes so Martha went into the center to help her.&#160; I stayed outside to counsel.&#160; Then along comes the male worker at Planned Parenthood checking out to see if anything of ours is touching the wooden base around the bushes.&#160; He stopped his car &amp; said "take your things off the base".&#160; Nothing was on it only a few signs were leaning against it.&#160; I said "have a nice day".&#160; He said "I'll be right over".&#160; He went to the back parking lot &amp; then went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told him later when he drove out that his priorities were all off.&#160; They are killing children in there where you work &amp; you do nothing &amp; all that you care about is our signs touching the base by the bushes".&#160; "You need help"&#160;I interjected.&#160; He drove away &amp; came back later &amp; didn't bother us but he will again, in the future.&#160; I went into the center to see that the drop off of things including a wooden high chair &amp; other nice things had arrived.&#160; I just missed the gentleman but I will call him later to thank him for all the nice things he brought to us.&#160; Dishes, vases, tea pot, coffee pot etc..&#160; How very thoughtful of him.&#160; As&#160;I was leaving I saw our client come in who just had her baby boy 6 weeks earlier.&#160; He was still in the hospital for she delivered early but is doing fine &amp;&#160;will be bringing&#160;him home in a few days.&#160; Little David Tobias.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; She received the wooden highchair that was just brought in as a donation &amp; the stroller we just received a few days ago.&#160; She also took some diapers, baby clothes &amp; other things &amp; was very happy to receive them.&#160; I gave her a hug good bye &amp; told her if she needed anything else in the future please call&#160;me &amp; she said that she would.&#160;&#160;I was thrilled to see her &amp; that she 'chose life'.&#160; I then went back outside to the front lines to be with Donna for Mary S. had to go back to work &amp; Martha wanted to stay in the center to help Sandy with the delivery that came in.&#160; I wasn't outside for very long when I lead a young girl into the center for a pregnancy test, she was going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; There she was in good hands with Martha &amp; Sandy, in the center.&#160; When I got back to the sidewalk there was the next door neighbor to Planned Parenthood Katharine Lynch walking down the sidewalk with her dog &amp; a young guy.&#160; I said to her "Katherine, don't have your dog pee on our signs".&#160; "O shut up"&#160;&#160;was her reply.&#160; Nothing changes.&#160; She then said "you don't own the sidewalk".&#160; I replied&#160; "either do you, your dog pees on my signs I'll call the police".&#160; The young guy said something but&#160;I didn't pay him an attention.&#160; This was between her &amp; I.&#160; As&#160;I was turning around to be more attentive at my post there was another young girl coming down the street.&#160; I stopped to talk to her &amp; said "come follow me".&#160; I brought her into the center for a pregnancy test &amp; counseling.&#160; Back to the street I go.&#160; I turned around &amp; there were 3 girls walking towards me.&#160; I recognized on of the girls in the middle &amp; it was our client who were going to have a Baby Shower for tomorrow on St. Patrick's Day.&#160; I went up to her &amp; gave her a big hug.&#160; The one girl with her was her sister &amp; the other girl was her friend.&#160; They had gone into the center to see me &amp; her&#160; friend had a pregnancy test.&#160; I was so glad to see her &amp; she is so excited about the Baby Shower tomorrow.&#160; I asked her to stay there for a few minutes, for&#160;I needed to go back into the center for a minute, for I needed to do something.&#160; She said that she would.&#160; When I came back I noticed that they all were talking to someone on the sidewalk.&#160;

If she thinks that she has problems now just wait &amp; see what will happen after the abortion.&#160; I put her into the Blessed Mother's care like all the other girls.&#160;I know that the Lord used Donna &amp;

In a couple of weeks now she will be holding her little boy in her arms.&#160; Yeah!!!&#160; :)</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">As I was saying good bye to my girls there comes from behind the bushes 2 young girls.&#160; I asked if we could help them.&#160; The one girl said that she was pregnant &amp; I told her that we had baby clothes in the center &amp; to come follow me, which they did.&#160; I thanked her for choosing life for her baby &amp; she told me that Planned Parenthood was trying to talk her into having an abortion.&#160; She gave them a piece of her mind &amp; then left, for she was disgusted with them.&#160; One other girl earlier told me that they pulled that on her to so she went to Strong Memorial Hospital &amp; continued her pregnancy &amp; had her baby daughter.&#160; She was so glad that she did.&#160; For some reason the girls think that the only place to get a pregnancy test is going to Planned Parenthood, no matter how they were treated by them in the past, we are aiming to change that.&#160; The word is getting out in the community that the Focus Pregnancy Help Center does FREE Pregnancy Tests &amp; care about them too.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">I went back to the sidewalk to be with Donna for she was by herself.&#160; She flagged a car that was going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; The gentleman said "do you have any pictures of a baby about 33 weeks along".&#160; Boy do we!!&#160; "Come follow me", which they did.&#160; They went into the parking lot &amp; tuned around &amp; followed me up the street a little ways to the center.&#160; I lead them into the center to be helped by Martha &amp; Sandy.&#160; I stayed with them, for it was very busy, in the center.&#160; They said that they needed financial assistance so Martha told them that Suzanne, the counselor on Thursdays, will call them to help them with their needs.&#160; They received&#160;some things,&#160;for their precious baby, in the womb.&#160; They left very grateful &amp; thanked us many times over.&#160; We thanked them for 'choosing life' for their little one &amp; that God will bless them for it.&#160; "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, for He careth for you".&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">When I was on the sidewalk &amp; called over to a gentleman who was waiting by his car.&#160; He walked over to Donna &amp; I &amp; he said that his old lady was in there applying for a job.&#160; I said "did I hear you say old lady".&#160; He just looked at me &amp; Donna said that the reference was okay if that's what he refers his girlfriend as.&#160; He said that she was there trying to get a job.&#160; Donna &amp; I said "are you a Christian"?&#160; He replied that he was.&#160; We said that the good Lord doesn't want her there working in a place that kill His creation.&#160; I offered him the 2 DVD's that we hand out &amp; he took them both &amp; the Truth packet &amp; our little 12 week old plastic baby.&#160; He said that he would give them to her &amp; she'll make up her mind.&#160; I asked if he belonged to a Church &amp; he said that he did, so I encouraged him to ask them to pray for a job for his girlfriend.&#160; He thought that was a good idea.&#160; Thank you Holy Spirit.&#160; Off he went back to the parking lot &amp; to his car.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">The roofers were back or at 2 of them.&#160; There must be a leak on the new roof for otherwise why would they be there, on top of the roof, harassing me.&#160; I thought the guy was waving at me so I waved back to him &amp; then he waved back to me until I noticed that it wasn't a wave but something else.&#160; I said to him that "a gentleman wouldn't treat a lady this way &amp; that if he had paid for an abortion, in his past, that this was no way to deal with it &amp; that we could help him".&#160; He was nasty &amp; I hope that he fixed the problem, on the roof,&#160;&amp; never comes back again but only to get help.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Martha came back outside to sidewalk counsel &amp; to pray.&#160; Donna had to leave for it was after 4:30pm.&#160; I thanked her for all her help &amp; that I would see her again next Tuesday.&#160; Martha &amp; I stayed on the street until after 5pm.&#160; I spoke to the abortionist, Rachel Phelps as she was leaving, for it tears me up inside to see her come in or out of this death mill where she kills God's children, all day long.&#160; Some of her victims did get away, for some have been born &amp; others are still cooking &amp; will be born later this year.&#160; I think that we have a baby a month, to be born, this year!&#160; Praise God!!&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I &amp; Melody, for she came to help us out, later on in the afternoon, to put away the signs &amp; literature box, from the sidewalk.&#160; We went into the center to work in there, for it was a big mess, &amp; then to sit down to eat my pot roast that I brought for supper.&#160; Praise God for 3 pregnancy tests given, about 8 or more Truth packets handed out plus 4 or more DVD's &amp; so many clothes &amp; items, that were given away to our clients, that I couldn't even count.&#160; Thank you Lord for such a blessed day!</font></strong></div>

<div><strong><font size="4">Today was the day of the Baby Shower, for our two girls.&#160; Martha &amp; I got to the center, after the noon Mass downtown, at Our Lady of Victory Church.&#160; When we got to the center we got busy doing so many things but first I went to the sidewalk to see if the abortionist was there &amp; she wasn't.&#160; Thank God!!&#160; I went back into the center &amp; started to get ready for the Baby Shower at 5pm.&#160; We were going to have an important meeting at 3pm, so I ordered the coffee next door&#160;at Mack's, for the gentlemen that were&#160;coming to the meeting, about the new center.&#160; I was also waiting for the Time Warner man to fix the new phone line in the center.&#160; He came around 2pm.&#160; He was a nice man &amp; we gave him 2 of our brochures for his 2 children to come &amp; receive baby clothes for his grandchildren.&#160; He must have had his children when he was very young.&#160; He was receptive in what we were doing here at the center.&#160; Just before he left I again went back outside to see if the abortionist, Rachael Phelps, was at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was standing, at my post by the tree, when I saw that a woman in white, was getting in her car.&#160; As she was by the mouth of the road I spoke to her.&#160; I told her that Planned Parenthood kills babies.&#160; She rolled down her car window &amp; said that she had 7 children &amp; that she was here for some literature.&#160; I then told her that we had a lot of literature at the center 2 doors down &amp; to come follow me.&#160; She did.&#160; She came into the center &amp; saw that we had a lot of literature.&#160; She was doing a nursing project &amp; was amazed that we had so much literature.&#160; She took what she needed plus the 2 DVD's that we hand out on the front lines.&#160; Just then I had to sign for the telephone service for the Time Warner man was done fixing the phone.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I signed &amp; said good bye to this nice gentleman &amp; continued with this very nice woman.&#160; She was most grateful for all the information that she received from the center.&#160; This was Divine Providence, for me to go to the sidewalk, at the time she was leaving Planned Parenthood.&#160; God is Great!!!</font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">So after that&#160;we had to start to blow up balloons, which Christina from the Taxi Company volunteered.&#160; Great job!&#160; Then the Elim girls came around 4pm to help to set up the room.&#160; They brought 2 beautiful cakes &amp; cupcakes.&#160; Earlier, Israel came with 2 sheet cakes for the party.&#160; She wasn't feeling very well so she had to go home to rest.&#160; Thanks dear Israel &amp; hope that you feel better real soon.&#160; The girls put up the blue streamers &amp; balloons &amp; the room took on a festive mood.&#160; We sent up the table where the food was to be &amp; the other table where the presents were to be.&#160; The Elim girls brought in 2 new strollers plus many baby gifts for the two moms &amp;&#160;$50 dollars each for the girls&#160;to buy what what needed.&#160; The pizza man had arrived with the 2 extra large pizza &amp; the 30 chicken wings.&#160; We put out the soda &amp; Sunny Dee &amp; now we were waiting for the guests to arrive, which they did.&#160; We had our 2 girls &amp; their family &amp; friends &amp; our friends coming in for the celebration of 'new life'.&#160; Praise God!!&#160;&#160; We ate, played game &amp; ate some more &amp; opened up presents for our girls.&#160; Our one girl, who thought she was going to have a boy, was now having a girl.&#160; Those ultrasounds sometimes are missed read but now we know for sure.&#160; So instead of David we have a Shinita.&#160; The party was lead by our 4 Elim Institute girls &amp; they did a great job!!&#160; Everyone left, after a 2 hour party.&#160; Before everyone left we had a prayer to thank God for the gift of 'life' with the Our Father Prayer.</font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">After the one family had left, the&#160;other mom came up to me &amp; told me that she just, found out tonight, that her 2 daughters had an RU 486 abortion at Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told her that they deceived her daughters about 2 years ago &amp; they&#160;didn't tell them what the pills, that they gave them, were for.&#160; The girls&#160;thought that they were pre natal vitamins &amp; took the pills &amp; their babies were killed.&#160; I gave the mother a card that&#160;read 1-888 U Can Sue &amp; I told her that I would be with her, if she decides to sue Planned Parenthood, or for any support&#160;that she needed&#160;during this difficult time.&#160; I gave her post abortive information.&#160; She went over to the door where I have the abortion procedure diagrams &amp; she looked at it &amp; said "this is murder".&#160; I said "yes it is".&#160; She was upset for what she just had found out.&#160; I don't know who told her but I guess it was her pregnant daughter for I think it is bothering her.&#160; The mom said that she never knew &amp; if she did there would have been NO abortions, in this family.&#160; Poor lady she came for her daughter's Baby Shower only to find out that she&#160;had lost 2 grandchildren to the murderous Planned Parenthood, two year ago.&#160; Hopefully she will call that number &amp; can sue this evil organization for what they did to her family.&#160; My heart&#160;goes out to her.&#160; The Elim girls &amp; Martha &amp; I helped to clean up &amp; we all had a great time, during the party.</font></strong>&#160;</div>

<div><strong><font size="4">When we arrived on the sidewalk, the abortionist Rachael Phelps, was not there.&#160; I am cautious for sometimes she shows up later on.&#160; When I was standing there I saw a woman walking on the other side of the street.&#160; I called over to her &amp; asked if she would like a Rosary.&#160; She said "poor babies, poor babies".&#160; I said "you are so right".&#160; I said "they are killing little babies here at Planned Parenthood" &amp; just then one of the workers came from behind the bushes to go to the mailbox to mail a letter that was in her hand.&#160; Then the lady hollered over to me that they wanted her to abort but she all 3 of her children".&#160; I said "yeah! do you need any children clothes"?&#160; She said back to me that her children are all grown up". The last thing I said to her was "you don't look old enough to have grown children".&#160; She said "thank you" with a smile on her young face.&#160; She must have been a teenager when she had her first baby, at least.&#160; She was a breathe of fresh air!&#160; </font></strong></div>

<div><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; Paul were out there on the sidewalk with the signs &amp; the literature box.&#160; Paul was nice enough to bring me a Wendy's hamburger for my lunch later on when I start to feel weak.&#160; I put the peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwiches back in the refrig for a later day.&#160; Suzanne just arrived, our Thursday afternoon counselor, so I went to the center to talk with her, for a few minutes, to catch her up on&#160;what happened on Tuesday.&#160; Just before I left to go to the center there was a car that pulled in with 2 guys &amp; a young girl.&#160; They pulled up right in front of the building to let her out.&#160; She&#160;was wearing&#160;a&#160;back pack, which isn't a good sign, for the girls sometimes bring&#160;extra clothes with them if they need to change into after the abortion, my heart dropped.&#160; I knew that the abortionist, was probably going to be here to do abortions later on, in the afternoon.&#160; When the 2 guys pulled out of the driveway I told them that if they dropped her off, to have an abortion, that they will be held accountable, for this murder.&#160; They just had a smirk on their faces &amp; sped out onto the street.&#160; I felt sick.&#160; I then left Martha &amp; Paul, to take over, &amp; I went to the center, to talk with Suzanne.&#160; While I was in the center, I noticed that Paul had put my burger &amp; ice tea in the office, so 'to kill 2 birds with one stone' I decided to eat while I was talking with Suzanne.&#160; It worked out pretty well, for I don't have to eat out on the street now,&#160;which I hate to do.&#160; Maybe I should just fast while I'm out there at times.&#160; I just don't want anyone to have to&#160;pick me up, from the sidewalk, if I faint.&#160; After I was finished with giving Suzanne, all the assignments, I went back to be with the team.&#160; When I got back with them I checked the parking lot to see if the abortionist was there now &amp; sure enough she was.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; Now I know that she was going to kill innocent babies here today.&#160; Just then I saw that the Death Escort was walking up the sidewalk to put on the apron of death as she escorts the victimizers to victimize their children.&#160; We are there for the undecided ones that are on the fence that they will fall on our side of the yard.&#160; We are there for everyone &amp; only hope &amp; pray that none of them will go into Planned Parenthood to have their precious babies be murdered by Rachael Phelps.&#160; </font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">We prayed, protested &amp; handed out some Truth packets, Rosaries &amp; DVD's,&#160;to people walking by us &amp; driving out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Our friendly school bus driver passes us by &amp; honks &amp; waves at us, every time when we are out on the front lines.&#160; We waived back with smiles on our faces.&#160;He energies us.&#160; A young woman drove by &amp; gave us the 'bird'. &#160;I called to her, as she was diving by us to, "repent &amp; we&#160;can help you".&#160; It's really so very sad.&#160;Cars came in &amp; out of Planned Parenthood, I don't know how many beautiful babies that&#160;the abortionist&#160;murdered here today,&#160;one is too many.&#160; Lord have Mercy on her soul &amp; all that work or are silent, in the Abortion Holocaust, in America.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I was in the center when Martha arrived, about 1:10pm.&#160;Martha had put&#160;her fettachini, that she made for our supper, in the refrigerator. &#160;I had two young girls come in with a little baby girl who was 5 weeks old, for some baby clothes.&#160; Her sister who was with her was pregnant &amp; was not sure yet if she was going to have a boy or a girl.&#160; So I said to her that when she knows she could come back to get some clothes for her baby.&#160; She took a green onesee for her baby.&#160; Her sister, with the baby gir,l took a real pretty pink dress with shoes.&#160; I said "this dress is for an older child &amp; she said that this was to be her daughters Easter dress. for she was 9 lbs..&#160; The dress was a 2T.&#160;&#160;I didn't want to wrestle with this dilemma, for she was the first to see the dress &amp; the baby will grow into it,&#160;probably to wear it for next year, for Easter.&#160; I shouldn't get&#160;so picky.&#160; I thanked them both for 'choosing life' for their children &amp; gave them some information &amp; then&#160;said good bye to them.&#160; I asked them how they knew about us &amp; the one girl, with the baby, said "someone from Planned Parenthood told us about this place".&#160; I said "someone at Planned Parenthood told you about us"!&#160; She said "yes, there were people in front of Planned Parenthood who said that you had free baby clothes &amp; we stopped by, for this was a couple of days ago, that someone told us about you".&#160; Now it makes more sense.&#160; It was us, on the sidewalk, that told them about us.&#160; Oh yeah!!&#160; &#160;They were very happy when they left.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">When I finally arrived, at my post to join Martha &amp; Valerie, I noticed that they were speaking to a girl who was had stopped to talk with them.&#160; When I approached, I heard the young woman say something about if the baby was unwanted.&#160; I lit into her like a match, for I had just experienced, the same air as an abortionist, a few minutes earlier, so I wasn't going to hear about devaluing life.&#160; I told her, in a stern voice, that all life is precious &amp; there are no unwanted babies, in the eyes of Almighty God, who created us all.&#160; She left to walk into Planned Parenthood, the 'haven of death'.&#160; No love or hope there behind their doors.&#160; Martha told me that she shared that her mother was a crack addict &amp; that she had a terrible life.&#160; Not to sound insensitive but welcome to the club.&#160; I know that I have suffered growing up in a dysfunctional family life, filled with evil.&#160; Please survivors, of a hellish existence, please don't devalue your life or anyone else's.&#160; God is crying, for God doesn't make junk &amp; He loves you so very much that He died on a cross for yours &amp; my sins, to give us Heaven for all eternity.&#160; Things will get better Martha told her &amp; you survived &amp; you have to forgive your mother &amp; yourself.&#160; She was in Planned Parenthood for about 45 minutes, nothing new there, &amp; when she came out I called out to her again, with words of love &amp; encouragement.&#160; Maybe I was to hard on her, God forgive me.&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Just then another young girl had gone to her car &amp; I spoke sternly with her for being at an abortion mill.&#160; I saw her coming towards us through the bushes.&#160; There she was in front of me.&#160; I try to hand her a Truth packet &amp; she said "no".&#160; Then she said that she didn't believe in abortion &amp; was hear for a blood test.&#160; Martha, in her gentle voice said "you could be my daughter, sweet girl".&#160; She smiled.&#160; I calmed down &amp; so did she.&#160; We began to talk.&#160; She said that she was at Planned Parenthood for a pregnancy blood test.&#160; I said that we could do a pregnancy test right now in the center &amp; the tests that we use are used in hospitals.&#160; She said that she just had a blood test which is more accurate.&#160; She made mention of some things so I asked her to wait &amp; I would go into the center to get her some information.&#160; When I came back out she was still there talking to Martha &amp; Valerie.&#160; She said that she could be about 13 weeks pregnant.&#160; I asked if she had an symptoms &amp; she said that she did.&#160; I said "why don't you come follow me into the center for a yellow or green onesee.&#160; She smiled &amp; followed me into the Material Aid Room.&#160; When we got there she started to look around the room.&#160; It is jam packed with so many nice things that we just got blessed with.&#160; She found a green &amp; white onesee with frogs on it.&#160; Then she said that she didn't believe in abortion only if the girl was raped.&#160; I said that I had been gang raped when I was 21 &amp; became pregnant &amp; I didn't have an abortion but I did miscarry my twins.&#160; She then said that she also had been raped several times &amp; she's just 20 years old.&#160; She also had a miscarriage of twins.&#160; She said that she even named her twins &amp; told me their names.&#160; I told her my babies names which are Jessica Rose &amp; Aaron Joseph.&#160; I gave her a big hug, for we were both still hurting.&#160; I talked with her for awhile &amp; then gave her Compass Care's number if she is pregnant &amp; wants an ultrasound &amp; also a name of a Social Worker to talk to about the rapes &amp; miscarriages.&#160; She was thankful for all this information.&#160; Then she told me that when her mother became pregnant she went to Planned Parenthood for pre natal &amp; they told her to abort.&#160; She left the facility immediately &amp; went to another clinic for pre natal care.&#160; Our young girl was the one that Planned Parenthood wanted to abort 20 years ago.&#160; I said I really don't know how you could go to the very organization that wanted you dead &amp; was willing to do it?&#160; She said that she didn't have insurance so I gave her more information that could help her.&#160; We walked back to the sidewalk &amp; we said good bye there.&#160; I asked her, if our counselor Suzanne could call her on Thursday, to see how she was doing,&#160;she said that would be fine.&#160; Good bye sweet girl.&#160;&#160;God is with you to help &amp; to heal you &amp; we are hear for you too.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">When you think that everything is fine, with your neighbors, you find out that they still hate you.&#160; Ick!!&#160; John &amp; I were setting up the sidewalk with our usual signs in the usual places when Buckpitt got all bent out of shape, again.&#160; John, who was putting up the signs, put the one sign up to far on the pole, by the driveway of Buckpitt who is the business right next to Planned Parenthood.&#160; A red van was coming into the driveway &amp; stopped.&#160; I gathered that he was telling him to put down the sign, which is what I was about to do.&#160;The van pulled intot he parking lot &amp;&#160;all I said to John was "it was a cope out".&#160; I guess what I meant was that the signs aren't really a problem for&#160;Buckpitt for&#160;when they pull out of their driveway they have to pull out far enough to see both sides of the on coming traffic, well pass the pole with our signs on it.&#160; I guess that's what I meant.&#160; Well the guy got out of the red van &amp; went ballistic.&#160; It was the owner, David.&#160;&#160;He started to disrespect me right&#160;away &amp; even used a four letter word to express his unfounded anger.&#160; If you're having a bad day don't take it out on me.&#160; John got involved in the action &amp; he was walking away, when David the owner called him back, to rage his truant on to him.&#160; I just told John to just keep on going into the center, which he did, otherwise it would have been 2 guys locking horns, over what???&#160; David went into his building &amp; I was glad.&#160; About 10 minutes later Kim, who works there &amp; is very friendly, came out &amp; waved at me.&#160; I approached her &amp; said that I didn't want any trouble &amp; I really don't know what just happened a few minutes ago.&#160; I am sorry that he misconstrued what had just taken place.&#160; She said in a quiet voice "I think that he called the police".&#160; What ! Over what??&#160; She said that she would go back in to ask him to cancel the call but he didn't.&#160; It was about 45 minutes later&#160;the police came &amp; went into Buckpitt.&#160; David came out swinging.&#160; He stood right in front of the police officer raising his voice &amp; saying things about our street ministry &amp; sated that he wanted a report.&#160; How sad, this guy is out of control.&#160; I thought that we had made progress with him over the past year.&#160; I even wished him a Merry Christmas &amp; a Happy New Year.&#160; I wouldn't take it back.&#160; The police officer came over to me &amp; I told him our side of the story.&#160; I told him that we are coming against Planned Parenthood, not Buckpitt, for we have enough to do in trying to save lives from being killed there.&#160; We were fixing the problem with the sign, when David went out of control.&#160; The officer stated that the owner of Buckpitt had some issues.&#160; 1. That the signs that we put in front of his building&#160;looked like&#160;harassment. (NO). 2. That we&#160;are in the driveway that is closed off.&#160;(YES). 3. That we were harassing his customers, verbally. (NO)&#160; 4.&#160;That we were harassing his customer with&#160;our signs in their faces.&#160;(NOT!!)&#160; Where are you getting this from, my friend??&#160; Yes, were are in&#160;his short driveway, that he doesn't use, in order to call out to the girls not to kill their babies &amp; he should be supportive of that.&#160; What kind of a person is he?&#160; Lord have Mercy!&#160; </font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong><strong><font size="4">A woman, who had just pulled, into the parking lot,&#160;who had&#160;parked&#160;close to where we were standing, showed no emotion when I told her what was going on in Planned Parenthood.&#160;&#160;I told her that she scared me more than the people that would react, for they still had a conscious.&#160; As she was driving out of the parking lot I said to her that I hoped that someday soon she will realize what is really going on in Planned Parenthood.&#160; One only hopes.&#160; </font></strong></div>

<p><strong><font size="4">I then saw 3 young people standing, in the parking lot of Planned Parenthood, smoking.&#160; Two guys &amp; one young girl.&#160; I offered her help at the Focus Pregnancy Help Center.&#160; She flipped out on me.&#160; She said for me to shut up &amp; said very disrespecting words to Martha.&#160; Then she started to walk towards us as if to beat the brains out of us.&#160; She was restrained by the two guys that were with her smoking.&#160; I told them that she didn't need to be comforted for bad behavior.&#160; I invited her to come to talk to us &amp; that we cared about her but nothing worked.&#160;My heart goes out to all the people &amp; sometimes the one who is the nastiest is the one that hurts the most.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I got to the center after Mass, downtown.&#160; We did a couple of things in the center &amp; Material Aid Room &amp; went out to the front lines to witness.&#160; I always look first to see if the abortionist is there &amp; she wasn't.&#160; I was so happy.&#160; But things change quickly on the front lines, which they did today.&#160; The abortionist Rachael Phelps drove in about 45 minutes later.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; We continued to call out to the people driving into the abortion mill to try to save their baby from being killed.&#160;&#160;I had to go back into the center for a few minutes &amp; while I was there the doorbell rang &amp; it was Martha bringing in a young woman to receive some baby clothes.&#160; I stayed with the woman until she was finished with her shopping &amp; then went back out to be with Martha.&#160; The weather was changing very fast it was starting to rain &amp; it was windy &amp; cold.&#160; We weathered it for awhile &amp; then Martha said that she was going into the center, for she catches colds, real easily.&#160; For her sake I went with her into the center.&#160; I was sad because there was no one else out there who could have stayed with me while Martha went into the center.&#160; We are getting more people to come out on the front lines &amp; will get more people in the summertime, but I have to look out for the health of our dear Martha, who gives, so much,&#160;of her&#160;time &amp; energy for the cause.&#160; &#160;We put all the signs in the hallway to dry &amp; then we went into the meeting room to eat our lunch.&#160; About an hour later Maria came in for she was to start today working as a counselor.&#160; Since we weren't out there on the sidewalk bringing the clients into her she decided to talk to us for awhile &amp; then leave.&#160; She will be back next Wednesday to witness out on the sidewalk.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">It was 4pm now &amp; the four Elim girls came to help us in the center &amp; the Material Aid Room.&#160; They told me that next week was their final day, for two of the girls will be graduating &amp; school will be over.&#160; I was sad to hear this for I thought that they would be coming until June.&#160; Goofy me!&#160; We talked for awhile mostly about the new changes that will be going on, in the center, for we want to rent the room, across the office, to be our counseling/conference room/literature room.&#160; After we discussed the ins &amp; outs two of the girls went into the office to work on the computer &amp; the other two girls went to the Material Aid Room to work putting away baby clothes&#160;that we just received.&#160; I kept them busy.&#160; They said good bye around 6pm &amp; I gave each of them a hug good bye &amp; said for them to drive carefully &amp; that we will&#160;see them next week.&#160; After they left John came in &amp; Martha wasn't feeling good so she left to go home to get some rest.&#160; I fixed John a plate of food &amp; then, he worked on the computer, writing a letter to the churches, asking for donations from their Tithing Committee, for the work of the center.&#160; We left around 9pm to go home.&#160; Another busy day.&#160; Praise God!!</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Thursday, April 8, 2010 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong><font size="4">This was a day from 'hell'.&#160; It started out that Martha came to the center &amp; was discussing some things before going out to the front lines.&#160; One thing that we discussed was having a 'surprise Birthday party' for Suzanne, our Thursday counselor, but as we discussing it she came into the office so I'm not sure if she heard Martha &amp; I talking about it, or not.&#160; I still hope that it will be a surprise.&#160; I'm going to make carrot cake cupcakes, for she is a healthy eater.&#160; We then all three discussed that it would be best to ask the client the questions on the Intake Sheet instead letting them fill it out.&#160; Okay, that's a good idea if we don't have two girls come in at the same time.&#160; The answer was for one of the clients to wait until the other gets done, so the Intake Sheet has the right information for Suzanne to do a follow up phone call.&#160; It would be easier for her to have the correct information &amp; also as much information as possible, in order to help the clients during &amp; after their pregnancies.&#160; Team work is best.&#160; After that Martha &amp; I went out to the front lines to counsel the Truth to others.&#160; Bill was already there witnessing across the street.&#160; We waved to him &amp; he waved back at us.&#160; He's the oldest pro lifer, who is now 81 years old, &amp; he still comes out on the front lines every Thursday form 1-3pm.&#160; What a trouper you are Bill.&#160; We love you!!&#160; It wasn't to long that we were out there that 2 young girls, were walking up the street, towards Planned Parenthood.&#160;&#160;I asked them if they needed a pregnancy test &amp; they said "yes".&#160; I said "come follow me", which they did into the center.&#160; I rang the doorbell, to notify Suzanne, that she has a client &amp; she came to the door to greet the new clients, for a free pregnancy test.&#160; I then went back to be with Martha.&#160; She was saying the Rosary &amp; I was counseling.&#160; The weather was better today &amp; we were now dressed to warmly because yesterday was so cold &amp; rainy &amp; damp, we thought that today was going to be the same, we were wrong.&#160; Earlier we were both changing into some cooler clothes, thank God for our Material Aid Room, for it has been a blessing to us too.&#160; I noticed that we had only 2 Truth packets left so I said to Martha, "how about I go into the center to make up some&#160;more Truth packets"?&#160; She said "go ahead I have Bill with me".&#160; "Okay" I said &amp; off I go into the Material Aid Room to make up some packets for our clients.&#160; As I was coming into the center I noticed a young girl walking into the center, for the door hasn't&#160;been fixed yet by the Landlord,&#160;so it doesn't close tight &amp; that means that anyone can walk right in.&#160; I'm sure glad that she was a nice person.&#160; I asked he if I could help her &amp; she said that she has been here before &amp; needed some&#160;clothes for her 2 year old daughter.&#160; I said "get what you need" &amp; then I called Suzanne, to be with her, to help find things.&#160; I couldn't make up any packets, in the room, until our client leaves, for I have to pull out 2 tables that are right in front of the children's clothes.&#160; So I waited for her to finish.&#160; When I came back from being in the other room she was on the phone.&#160;&#160;After she got off I asked if she needed a ride home &amp; she said "yes".&#160; I asked the Taxi B company, which is right&#160;down the hall, how much it would cost for a Taxi to Portland Ave.&#160; Christina said it would be about $6.&#160; I told the client but she said that she didn't have the money.&#160; I then thought of Martha.&#160; I went outside &amp; asked Martha&#160;if she would take her home, for she&#160;got a couple of big items &amp; couldn't carry them all.&#160; Martha said "yes" &amp; she helped her put&#160;the things in her car &amp; off they went to a street off of Portland Ave.&#160; Thanks Martha you're terrific!!&#160;&#160; </font></strong></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Jerry came to pray on the brick side of Planned Parenthood right in front of the building. &#160;He set up signs &amp; was praying, on his knees. &#160;I was on the side where the tall bushes are &amp; Bill was still across the street with his sign, we had Planned Parenthood covered on all sides. &#160;I saw that the Death Escort today was Barry Swan. &#160;I still try to tell him the Truth &amp; the evil that he is doing at Planned Parenthood but to no avail. &#160;After he left two&#160;strange&#160;looking girls&#160;came&#160;to take his place as Death Escorts</strong>.</font></p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="5">
<div><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>While Martha was taking our client home I stood by my post witnessing &amp; counseling.&#160; I noticed a woman on a bicycle with real long hair all the way down her back in a pony tail.&#160; I remember saying&#160;to myself that I don't think I want my hair&#160;to get that long, though it has a couple more inches to go.&#160; Well, all of a sudden she turns her bike around &amp; there she was right next to me on the sidewalk.&#160; I didn't know what to expect but I learned quickly that she was a nice person.&#160; She said that she sees us out here weekly, though I don't remember seeing her, on the days that we are out here.&#160; Then she was looking at the graphic pictures &amp; then she&#160;said "my daughter just had one".&#160; I said "your daughter just had a baby"?&#160; She replied "no, my daughter just had an abortion &amp; I tried to talk her out of it &amp; now she's crying all the time &amp; I'm so sad too".&#160; "I'm now worried about her soul, for I told her that God will take care of her &amp; the baby but she did it anyway".&#160; My heart sank for this caring woman &amp; connected with her pain.&#160; She described her daughter's situation.&#160;&#160;&#160;I told her&#160;that killing her baby wasn't going to solve her problems but&#160;will add more problems to her list, she agreed.&#160; I told her that abortion is&#160;intrinsically&#160;evil, which means it's always evil under no circumstances.&#160; In the situation where the life of the mother is threatened then you try to save both mother &amp; child &amp; trust in the Lord to have His way, for He is the author of life.&#160; In the situation of a rape &amp; incest, you don't kill another human being, for the crime of the father.&#160;<font color="#ff0000"> From the 'Priest for Life' web site:&#160; âThou shalt notâ¦â - Why abortion is evil.... </font></strong></font><a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/olmstedpart2.htm"><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><strong>http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/olmstedpart2.htm</strong></font></a></div>

<p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#000000">T</font>hen she told me that her other daughter has 2 children &amp; is married &amp; has an IUD in her.&#160; I told her about Natural Family Planning &amp; that the IUD is an abortificant, which causes an early abortion, which is taking a life.&#160; I <br />
invited her into the center to speak with Suzanne, our counselor &amp; to <br />
receive more information about the Natural way to space children when <br />
married.&#160; She followed me into the center &amp;I&#160; introduced her to Suzanne who helped her.&#160; I do hope to see her again some time.&#160; Nice lady &amp; my heart goes out to her in her loss &amp; in her pain.</font></strong></p>

Martha came back from running our client home with her items that she received form the Material Aid Room.&#160; I was hungry for it was nearing 3PM &amp;&#160;I was starting to feel icky.&#160; Then Bill &amp; Jerry came from across the street to where Martha &amp; I were to say the Chaplet of Divine Mercy Prayers at 3PM.&#160; So I decided to join them in prayer &amp; to wait to eat my peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich.&#160;&#160; We all finished the prayer in 10 minutes &amp; Bill left to go home (which was good) for what was going to happen in less then 10 minutes would have set Bill into a tissey for he is old school when dealing with bullies, remember we do not advocate violence &amp; he is 81 years old but he is a Korean Vet.&#160; So I was glad that he had just left to go home.&#160; What had happened was that Jerry that gone back to the brick side of Planned Parenthood to pray &amp; Martha &amp; I were on the tree side of Planned Parenthood.&#160; We were standing there, on the sidewalk, &amp; as I was taking my last bite of my peanut butter sandwich with strawberry jam a car pulled along side of us.&#160; He had rolled down his window &amp; began a truant for at least 20 or more minutes at us.&#160; He said sometime vulgar at Martha &amp; I &amp; I went on the defense to stand against this evil acting man.&#160; I didn't like what he said to us &amp; Martha &amp; I don't need to hers such a thing.&#160; So I said to him "go, get out of here or I'll call the police, I got your license number".&#160; In the <br />
past this usually works &amp; the person is off &amp; running but not this guy.&#160; He <br />
parks his car right behind Martha's car on the street right in front of the <br />
business next door to Planned Parenthood, &amp; gets out of his car &amp; starts to walk up to us.&#160; I told him that I had his license number &amp; am calling the <br />
police.&#160; He didn't even twitch but I did because I didn't have my cell phone <br />
on me so I knew that the only phone was in the office in the center &amp; I <br />
needed to get it.&#160; He was using more vulgarity &amp; went into the parking lot <br />
of Planned Parenthood &amp; told the two Death escort girls who were standing by the door of Planned Parenthood that they were doing a great job &amp; to keep it up.&#160; I tried to talk over him but her was right on their property screaming loudly.&#160; I felt sick to my stomach in what he just said.&#160; The guy that I was taking to in the car for 5 minutes earlier about abortion &amp; Planned Parenthood honked his horn in agreement to what this crazy man was saying.&#160; 'Misery loves company'.&#160; I called Jerry over to be with Martha so that I could go into the center to get the phone to call 911.&#160; He came over.&#160; I was hoping that when he saw Jerry he would go but no he stayed &amp; get keep on hollering.&#160; Martha asked him if he had paid for an abortion but he said "no, my wife just had a baby girl".&#160; I still think that he protested to mushily &amp; that he was a post abortive male from a previous relationship &amp; that when he saw the graphic sign Malachi, the aborted baby at 20 weeks on the sidewalk, he flipped out.&#160; He was a handsome male around 27 years of age or so with a dark blue shirt &amp; beige pants, driving a black volks wagon car.&#160; Jerry was now with Martha so I went into the center to get our portable phone to call 911.&#160; He knew that I was going to call the police but it didn't phase him in the least.&#160; I spoke with the 911 operator &amp; reported the incident &amp; he told me to stay on the phone until the police gets there or this man leaves, which I did.&#160; I described the man for the operator &amp; stayed away from him for the operator didn't want to escalate his rage.&#160; Martha &amp; Jerry were trying to talk to him but he didn't care to what they were saying just what he was saying.&#160; I was waiting for the police &amp; I was hoping that they would get there before he left but that didn't happen.&#160; I saw him getting into his car &amp; as he passed me by he puled his head out the window to say something icky to me &amp; at least the 911operator heard it to.&#160; I told the operator where he was heading which was downtown &amp; said thank you &amp; goodbye &amp; that I will now wait for the police to arrive.&#160; The police arrived about less then 5 minutes later.&#160; The officer said that they were just changing shifts when they got the call.&#160; I said that was fine &amp; Martha described the incident to the officers.&#160; I asked the officer who was driving if he would go to the house of the man to speak to him for he did raise his hand at us &amp; said that he would be back again next week.&#160; The officer said that after he gets done with some things that he would stop by the man's house to speak to him.&#160; I said "thank you officer" &amp; then they left.&#160; I then asked Martha what else did he say &amp; she said that when she asked him the name of his baby daughter he gave a swear word in response to the question.&#160; He called us idolaters &amp; that the people going into Planned Parenthood had a right to do so.&#160; Sure, as long they don't kill anyone or hurt themselves, which is what is going on <br />
in there.&#160; We are our Brothers Keepers, the Bible says.&#160; This man was out of control &amp; I do hope that the police goes to his house tonight to talk to <br />
him.&#160; If he acts the way he did to us to the police &amp; might be in jail at <br />
the end of the day.&#160; His poor wife &amp; baby daughter.&#160; We do hope &amp; pray that he gets help real son &amp; that he doesn't come back to harass us here on the sidewalk next week for I'll call the&#160; police again, I have his license <br />
number &amp; I will carry my cell phone in my pocket from now on!!&#160; To be on the safe side for we get this kinda stuff happening in better weather.&#160; Can't <br />
wait for winter.</font></strong></p>

As I was still talking to Martha a young girl with a pacifier in her mouth &amp; was carrying a baby in the carry all came over to me on the sidewalk.&#160; It was Katherine &amp; she was bringing little Khy-mier for me to see.&#160; He is our RU 486 save last year.&#160; This baby only had about 1/2 hour to live a the mother swallowed the deadly pills &amp; had 2 pills up into her cervix to push the baby out of her.&#160; This is called an Chemical Abortion.&#160; I was so glad to see them both.&#160; I asked if her grandmother was in the center &amp; she said that she was.&#160; I hurried into the center to see Pat, our infamous grandmother who saved her 2 great grand babies, through the grace of God, from abortion.&#160; Little Akira is her other great grand baby &amp; she is doing very well &amp; is 14 lbs. now.&#160; She was born 1lb. 8ozs. in July &amp; was due in November, 2009.&#160; Praise God for their survival.&#160; I visited with them for a awhile &amp; after they left Jane't came in for our Thursday meeting group.&#160; Bill was there &amp; so was John but Martha had to go.&#160; After the meeting John &amp; I ate supper &amp; did some work in the office.&#160; We went home around 9pm tonight.&#160; Stressful day but through the grace of God we got through it, once more.</font></strong></p>

Sandy, our Tuesday counselor, wasn't coming today but will be back next week.&#160; I then went to the front lines to be with the team.&#160; Mary S. was on the side of Planned Parenthood by the brick &amp; she had already gave out a Truth packet &amp; so did Martha, for she &amp; Tony &amp; Donna were on the side, by the bushes.&#160; Just then a young girl came up the sidewalk &amp; I approached her &amp; offered her a free pregnancy test.&#160; She said that she was going to meet her sister there along with her little niece.&#160; She said that she will come back as soon as she picks up her niece who was 2 years old.&#160; I saw that she went over to the young girl, with the young child, who were sitting on the bench at Planned Parenthood. I was trying to talk to her for a long time, offering her free children clothes &amp; free pregnancy tests., but she didn't respond.&#160; Only hours later I made some contact with her &amp; brought her into the center to give her Compass Care information to get free STD testing, for her boyfriend &amp; the father of her 2 children had cheated on her &amp; she wanted to be tested.&#160;&#160;She went to Planned Parenthood &amp; waited for hours, to be tested,&#160;but&#160;to no avail.&#160; They never saw her &amp; she was mad.&#160; "What do you expect from an organization that is evil"?&#160; I said.&#160; She agreed.&#160; I gave her the information &amp; she said that she will call Compass Care because she also&#160;wants to bring her girlfriend along with her for testing too.&#160; She needs to contact her girlfriend to see when it would be a&#160;good time&#160;for them both to go.&#160; So sorry girls.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">I had to go back into the center&#160;&amp; as I was leaving Martha was bringing the young girl, who was meeting her sister at Planned Parenthood, &amp; she had her 2 year old niece with her.&#160; So Martha brought her into the Rose Room for the pregnancy test &amp; the little girl went into the Material Aid Room to be with Melody, which helped her get real neat toys.&#160; After the pregnancy test, the mom went into the Material Aid&#160;Room to&#160;get some nice clothes for her.&#160; All is well with this nice family.&#160;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">&#160;I then went back to the front lines to be&#160;the team.&#160; Three girls walked into Planned Parenthood &amp; we offered them a free pregnancy test &amp;&#160;free baby clothes.&#160; The one girl rubbed her stomach &amp; said that she was going in here for an exam &amp; will come back out for baby clothes.&#160; We said "great we'll see you soon &amp; please don't trust this place for they kill babies in there".&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">A car had pulled along side of the sidewalk &amp; stopped.&#160; Donna went over to the car &amp; recognized the driver &amp; greeted him.&#160; He had stopped awhile ago &amp; I remember that Donna had spent a lot of time with him but was going no where.&#160; I had a crucifix in my hands as a witness &amp; he bent over the car seat to say to me "is he Black".&#160; I said I'm not going there to your racist comment for He was Jewish", &amp; walked away.&#160; I said if you're going to start something maybe you should speak to the police about &amp; got out my cell phone, which I now have with me after the last Thursday's event.&#160; Instead of leaving he pulled in back of Martha's car.&#160;Deja Vu !&#160; He got out &amp; then I got his license number &amp; pretended to call the police.&#160; John was saying something to him but I asked him not to engage with him, for we wanted him to go away, which he did, a few seconds later.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; It's that time of year when we get harassed the most because of better weather.&#160; I'm glad that I had my phone &amp; did the 'pretend to call the police trick' &amp; it worked.&#160; He drove by on Wednesday &amp; flipped us the bird.&#160; Oh well, at least he didn't stop.&#160; I think Donna was hurt because she thought that he would be more receptive this time.&#160; Sorry Donna, it might take more time, don't give up.&#160; </font></strong></p>

<div><strong><font size="4">Martha &amp; I went&#160;to the center right after Mass downtown.&#160; We got everything set up outside &amp; Bill was witnessing on the other side of the street.&#160; The Death Escort Silvia Rose, was with her friend the other Death Escort,&#160;cleaning up the trash on the property of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I told them that no matter what junk that they pick up it's still a dirty, rotten, filthy abortion mill.&#160; The one girl snickered.&#160; They just don't get it.&#160; Deaf, Dumb &amp; Blind.&#160; All we can do is pray for them, they have to do the rest, by repenting.&#160; Hope that they do.&#160; I was agitated when I saw that a Mom &amp; Dad went in with their baby.&#160; This scenario makes me ill.&#160; I spoke to them when they came out but the Death Escort Barry Swan started to talk to them.&#160; I said that "you're talking to the devil &amp; please don't bring your precious baby into this horrible place where they kill babies".&#160;&#160; I said "that if you didn't want this baby, when he or she was in your womb, then Planned Parenthood would have killed your baby for $$$".&#160; There is such a blank look on some of these faces that my heart breaks.&#160; They just don't get it.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font size="4">I saw that a young guy was waiting outside &amp; wasn't responsive to anything I was saying.&#160; "I hope that you're not waiting for your baby to be killed"?&#160; Nothing.&#160; Again the blank look on his face.&#160; So sad.&#160; Then there was a car filled with people.&#160; A girl got out &amp; went in &amp; the other 3 guys stayed outside.&#160; They were there for a couple of hours.&#160; I spoke to them &amp; showed then our graphic signs.&#160; Blank.&#160; Here we go again.&#160; It was like I was talking to all ZOMBIES!&#160; Scary stuff.&#160; The girl came out &amp; went into the car with her brown paper bag.&#160; I think that she had an abortion &amp; as they left the parking lot I exclaimed to the "Lord have Mercy on your souls".&#160; My stomach was turning around in there.&#160; It was after 4pm &amp; the abortionist was still there, of course.&#160; The more killing the better for her- more $$ in her pocket to go shopping.&#160; </font></strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong><font size="4">I said to the girls that would follow the Death Escort into Planned Parenthood that they had no boundaries that they shouldn't follow any guy that they don;t know anywhere.&#160; "Where are your boundaries girls".&#160;&#160;Then I called over to the Death Escort that he was a pervert, that what he was doing was perverted, leading girls into a building that&#160;kills people.&#160; He seemed to look, for the first time, a bit nervous.&#160; Maybe I hit a sore spot.&#160; He got into his car &amp; went out of there.&#160; Bye Bye Barry!&#160; </font></strong></p>
