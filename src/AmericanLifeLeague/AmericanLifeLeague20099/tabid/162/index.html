In fact, most Americans who take the time to think about the truth regarding abortion and its aftermath understand it as well. The hard truth, the inconvenient truth, is that the violence perpetrated against Pouillon and the second victim of their killer, Harlan Drake, is but another example of how far too many people view problems and troublesome events in their lives these days. For 36 years, this nation has sanctioned the direct murder of innocent babies prior to birth and defined that massacre of the innocents as a right, a decision to be made between a woman and her doctor. The truth about abortion has been rejected by millions. Even President Barack Obama doesn't get it or refuses to see the grim reality of just how damning abortion advocacy in America has become.&#160; </span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt"><o:p></o:p></span></font></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><font size="4"><span style="font-size: small"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana">Violence is, indeed, never the right answer!

Pouillon did this not for any publicity that he might gain, not for a place in history and certainly not for the applause he would hear from the thousands who would line the streets to cheer him on in life and mourn the great loss of his contribution to society in his death. He did not seek fame or fortune; he sought to do the will of God.</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt"><o:p></o:p></span></font></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><font size="4"><span style="font-size: small"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana">James Pouillon did what he did because he knew the truth, and he wanted to share it with young and old alike.

Excerpts from <em>The Winning Side</em> by Charles E. Rice</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">After declining to decide whether an unborn child is a living human being, the Supreme Court ruled that he is not a person, since the “the word ‘person,’ as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.” Regardless of whether he is a human being, he is not a person. This ruling is the same, in effect, as ruling that an acknowledged human being is a nonperson. As a nonperson, the unborn child has no more constitutional rights than does a goldfish or a turnip.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Once the Court ruled out the rights of the unborn nonperson, the only right remaining was the mother’s right to privacy. While asserting that this right is not absolute, the Court defined it so as to permit, in effect, elective abortion at every stage of pregnancy up to the time of normal delivery.&#160; According to <em>Roe</em>, even after viability, when the state may regulate and even prohibit abortion, the state may not prohibit abortion “where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.” The health of the mother includes her psychological as well as physical well-being. And “the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors – physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age – relevant to the well-being of the mother. This is equivalent to a sanction for permissive abortion at every stage of pregnancy.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The essential holding of <em>Roe</em> is that the unborn child is not a “person” within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects the right to life of persons.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">But, you ask, hasn’t the Court retreated from its holding in <em>Roe</em>? Not really. Since 1973, the Court has upheld marginal restrictions on abortion, such as a requirement that abortions be performed by physicians. In 1992, in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em>, the Court upheld Pennsylvania requirements that the woman be given information about abortion 24 hours before the abortion; that a minor have the consent of a least one of her parents, or the approval of a judge, before she can have an abortion; and that abortion facilities comply with record keeping and reporting requirements. But the Court struck down a requirement that the woman notify her spouse before the abortion.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The Court in <em>Casey</em> described the woman’s right to an abortion as a “liberty interest” protected under the Fourteenth Amendment rather than as an exercise of the right to privacy. “[L]iberty as conceived in <em>Casey</em> is broader than privacy as conceived in <em>Roe</em>. But the shift has significant substantive ramifications as well … Abortion as privacy, for instance, means that women are protected against governmental intrusion but can make no claim to governmental assistance. Abortion as a liberty issues, on the other hand, permits a broader understanding of abortion that more accurately reflects the multiple meanings of reproductive rights … By identifying abortion as part of a more general liberty interest, the Court raised the stature of the abortion decision.”</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">In 1997, the Court described its <em>Casey</em> ruling as follows: “There, the Court’s opinion concluded that ‘the essential holding of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> should be retained and once again reaffirmed.’&#160; We held, first, that a woman has a right, before her fetus is viable, to an abortion, without undue interference from the State, second, that States may restrict post viability abortions, so long as exceptions are made to protect a woman’s life and health; and third, that the State has legitimate interests throughout a pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child.”</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Although the Court allows marginal restrictions on abortion, the Court will not allow the states to enact any effective prohibition of abortion at any stage or pregnancy. The Court requires that the states allow abortion for emotional as well as physical health even up to the time of normal delivery.&#160; The Court has also imposed sever restrictions on pro-life activities at abortion sites.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>Preliminary injunction granted in IL conscience case — Pharmacists score a win in long battle for their rights</em><br />

In one day, her health plummeted.<br /><br />
"I woke up last Thursday morning with shortness of breath. I actually tried to work out that morning, and I had to stop because I could not breathe. Then, I actually coughed up a little blood so that was alarming, but being 28 and healthy, I just didn't really think much of it, she said.<br /><br />
But the pain got worse and at the urging of her mom, who is a nurse, she checked herself into the emergency room. A CAT scan revealed blood clots in her lungs.<br /><br />
"When I was in the ER they came in and said you have multiple in both lungs and that was shocking. It wasn't just like I had one. I had multiple. I said "Well, how many is multiple"? and he said, "I can't really count them". He told me if I did not come to the emergency room when I did, I could've died instantly, she said.<br /><br />
It wasn't until that moment that Patti learned she was genetically predisposed to the condition. Her mom also survived a blood clot earlier in her life. It just wasn't anything they talked about.<br /><br />
"The doctor said that could've been a factor but the birth control is definitely a big factor, she said.</strong></font></p><p><font size="4"><strong>Blood clots have been a known side effect of the birth control pill for many years now, and the anecdotal evidence is mounting, not to mention clinical studies that have tied the pill to the same side effect.<br /><br />

Today, it is my sincere privilege to provide you with what is the last word on the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy's funeral. Rev. Brian Harrison holds a doctorate in systematic theology, and is a well-known writer and speaker. He is also among the most faithful, inspiring Catholic priests I know.&#160;<br /><br />
It is my hope that you will appreciate his words as much as I appreciate bringing them to you. Please note, below it,&#160;the two canons from the Code of Canon Law that should have been applied by the prelates who made decisions regarding funeral rites for Senator Kennedy.<br /><br />
The following is&#160;Father Harrison's commentary. (An adapted version was posted by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=353&amp;L=2523&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="4">LifeSiteNews.com</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="4">.)</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">As a Roman Catholic priest, I feel a duty in conscience today to register, to the couple of hundred people to whom I have ready access, my emphatic dissent from a message that was projected around the nation and the globe this morning to millions of viewers and listeners by certain other members of the Roman Catholic clergy.<br /><br />
Kennedy's Funeral Mass is a Scandal<br /><br />
I refer to this morning's televised funeral Mass, celebrated in Boston's Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, for the recently deceased Senator Edward Moore Kennedy. It was a Mass I regard as a scandal comparable to, if not worse than, the scandal given several months ago when the nations most prestigious Catholic university bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Barack Hussein Obama, the most pro-abortion and â€œpro-gay president in U.S. history.<br /><br />
Why, you ask, should a Catholic priest raise such objections to a Catholic funeral for a Catholic legislator? Well, I am afraid this funeral was no ordinary Catholic funeral.<br /><br />
&#160;For to those innumerable viewers and listeners of many religions (or none) who were aware of Senator Kennedy's public, straightforward, radical, longstanding, and (as far as we know) unrepented defiance of his own Church's firm teaching about the duty of legislators to protect unborn human life and resist the militant homosexual agenda, this mornings Mass, concelebrated by several priests, presided over by Cardinal Sean O'Malley, archbishop of Boston, and adorned by a eulogy from the aforesaid U.S. president, effectively communicated a tacit but very clear message: The Church does not really take too seriously her own official doctrines on these matters! <br />
I feel impelled, therefore, to make known, to anyone willing to read these lines, that there are many other representatives of the Catholic Church, such as the undersigned, who take those doctrines very seriously indeed.<br /><br />
How would our Church leaders act if they really did take seriously an official Church position from which a prominent deceased Catholic had publicly dissented? <br /><br />
To answer that question, we need only imagine a situation in which some well-known Catholic legislator had, for years, supported the Church's social teaching across the board, in regard to human life, marriage, compassion toward the poor and underprivileged, etc., but had then, in old age, lapsed into supporting some ideological position that was strongly opposed not only by the Church, but also by the dominant Western elites in government, law, education, commerce and the media.<br /><br />
Suppose, for instance, that he had come to endorse white supremacism or Holocaust denial. Now, when the moment for this Catholic legislators funeral came, could we imagine for one moment that our cardinals, bishops and other leading clergy, mindful of this man's sterling and thoroughly orthodox contributions to the common good over so many years in Congress, would compassionately overlook his latter-day lapse into racism or anti-Semitism?<br /><br />
Would they agree to give him a free pass in regard to this defect? Would they speak and act as if it were nonexistent? Would they grant him a televised funeral Mass in a large basilica, presided over by a cardinal, in which he would be publicly eulogized by both family and public figures?<br /><br />
These questions really answer themselves. Of course none of that would occur! The local bishop might go as far as to allow our hypothetical Catholic racist or anti-Semite a Church funeral, if it was known that (like Senator Kennedy) he had confessed sacramentally to a priest before death.<br /><br />
However, the bishop would allow the use of Church property for this funeral on the strict condition that only close personal family and friends would be admitted. All media transmission or even presence during the service itself would surely be forbidden. (It would, of course, be unnecessary for the bishop to ask his fellow bishops and other high Church dignitaries not to attend the service; for all of them, like the bishop himself, would already prefer to be anywhere else on earth than at the funeral of one who had lapsed so unspeakably from society's ruling canons of acceptable behavior.)<br /><br />
Yes, society's canons. There, I am afraid, lies the difference between our two scenarios. <br /><br />
Is it that official Catholic doctrine is incomparably more opposed to racism and anti-Semitism than it is to abortion and sodomy? Not at all. The big difference is simply that most members of the Catholic hierarchy in Western society today&#160; and there are, of course, a number of honorable exceptions are lacking in prophetic courage. They are ready and eager to take vigorous and resolute public disciplinary action only against those deviations from Church teaching which also happen to be excoriated by the cultural and media elites.<br /><br />
But if it is our prelates themselves who will be excoriated by those elites as would certainly have occurred had they required for Ted Kennedy's funeral the kind of severe restraint we envisaged above for that of our hypothetical bigot then all eagerness for just discipline will evaporate as fast as dew in the morning sun. Pastoral compassion, forgiveness, tolerant respect and Christian charity will now be instantly invoked as reasons for cloaking in total silence the public enormities committed decade after decade by an ecclesially heterodox but socially orthodox legislator.<br /><br />
So, It's St. Kennedy Now?<br /><br />
So it was, in this mornings funeral Mass, that the homilist, Fr. Mark Hession (pastor of Kennedy's Cape Cod parish), made his sermon a eulogy about what a wonderful Catholic Christian Ted was, assuring us that we could be confident that he is already with Jesus in glory. <br /><br />
So it was that the principal celebrant, Fr. Donald Monan, SJ, chancellor of Boston College, not only repeatedly told those present and the whole watching world that Senator Kennedy was a man of â€œfaith and prayer, with a deep devotion to the Eucharist, but also assured us that this faith and prayer in private was precisely what inspired and motivated his public policies, so that there was (surprise, surprise) a real integration and unity between his private and public life!<br /><br />
Well, a lot of us didn't quite manage to see any private-public unity based on Roman Catholic principles. On the contrary, Kennedy's huge political influence, based on both the family's prestige and the personal dynamism of this Lion of the Senate, if anything, made his U-turn on abortion (yes, he was pro-life in his younger days) an even more scandalous counterwitness: a sign of conflict, not union, with that Church to which he professed loyalty.<br /><br />
Here are two comments I have just lifted off a Catholic blog:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 80px"><strong><font size="4">1. There's this big,˜What if? said Catholic author Michael Sean Winters. If Ted Kennedy had stuck to his pro-life position, would both the (Democratic) Party and the country have embraced the abortion on demand policies that we have now? I don't think so.<br /><br />
2. Russell Shaw, former spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that when Kennedy defied the Church on issues such as abortion and later, gay marriage, he reinforced a corrosive belief among Catholics that they can simply ignore teachings they don't agree with.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Public Scandal Is Grave Matter<br /><br />
I myself remember, several years ago, a conversation with a young woman who had been brought up Catholic but had recently been born again as an Evangelical Protestant. One of the arguments she threw at me was, Even your Church leaders don't really believe what Catholics are supposed to believe. Why don't they excommunicate Ted Kennedy? He's blatantly, 100% pro-choice! Yet they do nothing!<br />
What could I say to her? And what can I say now, after today's public scandal? That young lady's complaint was simply that this man remained a Catholic in good standing. I find I must now complain to you of something worse. <br /><br />
Before the whole world this morning, my fellow Catholic clerics in Boston did not just accord him the good standing of a normal, flawed Catholic whose soul we can hope is in Purgatory. Rather, clad in triumphant white vestments instead of penitential violet (never mind the traditional black!), they have placed him on a pedestal, granting him an unofficial instant canonization!<br /><br />
Scripture Warns Us<br /><br />
The Church's teaching is already abundantly clear that all this is very wrong. So perhaps we can legitimately discern the hand of God's Providence, which rules all things, in a coincidence that suggests a manifestation of God's grave displeasure at this kind of mockery injustice masquerading as â€œpastoral charity. <br /><br />
In our liturgy, Sunday has begun as I write at the hour of Vespers on Saturday. But the earlier part of this day, August 29, including the time of the Kennedy funeral, was observed by Catholics around the world as the Feast of the Beheading of St.&#160;John the Baptist. In normal Masses celebrated today, the biblical account of his martyrdom was read (Mark 6: 17,29.) The parallels are striking: (a) We see two powerful civil authorities; (b) both of them flip-flop in a morally bad direction (Herod originally respected and defended John, and Kennedy originally respected and defended the unborn); and (c) both of them abuse their power by authorizing the shedding of innocent blood.<br /><br />
As if that were not enough, the longest Scripture reading in todayâ€™s liturgy also grabs our attention. It is prescribed not for the Feast of John the Baptist, but independently, for the Saturday of Week 21, in the Office of Readings. This is a part of the daily Liturgy of the Hours, which is required spiritual reading for us Roman Rite clerics. And todays reading just happens to be Jeremiah 7: 1:20, in which the prophet vigorously denounces&#160; guess what? The hypocrisy of Israels religious leaders who proudly identify with the temple and the rites they celebrate within it, while at the same time they are living unrighteously (including shedding innocent blood, verse 6) and even pouring out libations to strange gods (verse 18). God therefore warns, {My anger and my wrath will pour out upon this place} (verse 20). <br />
Orthodox Catholics will surely ask whether God can be any less angered now by those clerics who today carried out temple rites giving undeserved honor to a legislator who, for decade after decade, poured out the libations of his eloquence, influence and Senate votes in the service the â€œfalse gods of Planned Parenthood and NARAL which regularly rewarded him with 100% ratings for his pro-choice record.<br /><br />
Enough. If, in your charity, you pray for God to be merciful to the soul of Edward Moore Kennedy, please pray for all of us Catholic priests as well and be cognizant of the fact that some of us are profoundly indignant at what we saw our brethren doing today.<br /><br />

But this devil is also a chameleon, created in a very crafty fashion.<br /><br />
Anyone who has experience with negotiating labor contracts as does the writer is well aware that vague language or no mention of an issue ultimately leads to the need for interpretation. What is implied in the wording becomes the real focus. Its meaning is interpreted by one party's own appointed bureaucrats, a favorable regulator or by judge-shopping within the judicial system. The tack which all of these people will take has been predetermined, so this is at the core of the administration's modus operandi.<br /><br />
This bill is, in part, about putting an indelible stamp on abortion as a way of death. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are also included by implication in this health package; otherwise, they would have been explicitly excluded. The true test of the Obama administration's intent lies in the wording. The gaggle of attorneys surrounding President Barack Obama are well aware of how to write clear-cut language that would allow no wiggle room and would convey sincerity. Likewise, along party lines and with his support, the Democrats have steadfastly voted down amendments that would protect the right to life of innocent human beings across the entire life spectrum. The intent of Obama and his supporters has been made crystal clear.<br /><br />
In stark contrast, as a presidential candidate, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=236&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> did use very clear language in his promises to the abortion industry. He said he would sign into law the Freedom of Choice Act&#160; and support abortion in every instance, including </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2483&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">partial-birth abortion</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">.&#160;He deemed clarity to be essential then. But now he is resorting to self-righteous verbal tap-dancing while charging at town-hall meetings that his opponents are trying </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2485&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">to scare and mislead the public</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">.&#160;Who is trying to mislead whom?<br /><br />
Fresh from being honored by this country's best-known Catholic university, the president has informed the leading abortion providers that, in view of the heat generated by Catholic opponents to his award from Notre Dame, he will forego a heads-on approach to FOCA. Why not? The same end can now be attained incrementally through passage of this health care reform legislation. <br />
Although he was careful to not select a single individual with a pro-life background for a high-level position, he has nominated many who profess to be Catholic. This was part of the design. It provides cover in the shell game being played to convert this massive health care package into law and codify abortion on demand by an indirect route.<br /><br />

At first blush, it sounds compassionate, but it withers away quickly when challenged on substance. All of it is leftist demagoguery repackaged.&#160;<br />

Though he was too ill to&#160;attend his sister Eunice's funeral, the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy was nonetheless exploited (apparently with family approval) to promote what is essentially a power grab. Unfortunately, Senator Kennedy apparently did not focus on ensuring that the health care overhaul would respect the right to life of all human beings, from creation to natural death as he should have done in his waning days, in reparation for his many years of abortion advocacy.<br /><br />
Instead, the proposal is fraught with unanswered questions about the motives behind it and its ultimate consequences. What a sad scenario! I contacted Senator Kennedy's Washington office to propose the following wording in the Senate version: The intent of this legislation is to promote the health of all human beings. Nothing in the wording shall be construed to include counseling for or the funding of abortion, euthanasia or assisted suicide.<br />
If this 1,100-plus-page document or even one with only 600 words is passed, Obama's advisors and bureaucrats will start chipping away to undermine and ultimately destroy conscience clauses as well as parental consent requirements, waiting periods and every other restriction on the destruction of life in utero. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2481&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> is clearly feticidal and infanticidal as well. He proved it as the Illinois state senator who voted three times to deny medical care to a child born alive as a result of a failed attempt to abort him or her.&#160;And </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2482&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;expressly voiced the belief that a Supreme Court opinion cut out of whole cloth in 1973 took precedence over any right to life one could claim for a defenseless human being in need of medical care if the intent was to legally end the life of that human being. <br /><br />
Abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide are not health care.&#160;Each stops a beating human heart permanently. Health care is designed to keep that heart beating until it ceases to function on its own. We now have the hearts of over a million humans stopped legally each year. That figure would grow drastically under Obamacare. Yes, where this man wants to take the country is a very scary place.<br /><br />
The primary issue in the entire health care debate is not whether some reform is needed; it is how we should approach the issue through&#160;a blanket overhaul or by breaking down the effort into its component parts and addressing them individually? Moreover, if explicitly worded exclusions for abortion, assisted suicide or euthanasia counseling and/or funding are not added to the legislation, any deal must be broken before it moves to a conference committee on which the administration is heavily relying to accomplish its goals.<br /><br />
The president of the United States has an atrocious record of disregard for preborn babies human dignity and&#160;right to life, which logically leads to the conclusion that he harbors the same&#160;attitude toward&#160;the defenseless elderly and infirm. <br /><br />
Obama must be held to a moral standard far superior to that which he has thus far displayed toward&#160;life-and-death matters.&#160;He is showing all his cards in H.R. 3200 and gives us no alternative but to vigorously oppose this bill and defeat it. Our efforts cannot be relaxed until this is accomplished.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br />

The bishop has the ultimate say over its fate, and he's putting himself in the position of being undercut. His powers are either diluted or eliminated throughout the agreement.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Souza and Hagan, on behalf of NHRTL and the pro-life community in greater Manchester, on August 11 filed a formal Memo of Opposition with the charitable trusts division of the New Hampshire attorney general's office.

D-H doctors have testified in the state legislature against the diocese on end-of-life issues, Souza explained.

He declined to answer questions posed by American Life League about it, or to meet with several concerned&#160;pro-life actvisits,&#160;despite their repeated requests this spring.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">According to a statement on </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2470&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">AHealthierTomorrow.org</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;(a web site unveiled July 22 to explain the plan), the goal is to create an integrated healthcare delivery system that maximizes Manchester-based resources aimed at increasing access to enhanced quality patient care.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Bishop </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2472&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">McCormack</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> has stated, As bishop, I am committed to preserve Catholic Medical Center to be a true Catholic healthcare institution, one that fulfills all the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic hospitals.&#160;&#160;He is referring to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2404&amp;F=H">Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care</a></em>.&#160;Part Six of this document, titled a Forming New Partnerships with Health Care Organizations and Providers, provides norms for guiding the faithful through the dangers inherent in Catholic-secular hospital mergers and other minefields. It notes, The risk of scandal cannot be underestimated when partnerships are not built upon common values and moral principles.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">But since the plan was announced, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2473&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">DHH</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;officials have been consistent. There will be no curtailment of its reproductive services such as contraception and abortion, according to repeated statements to the media provided by spokesman Jason Aldous and other DHH officials.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Where's the truth? Black can't be white and white can't be black, said Souza. A Catholic institution doesn't only have an obligation to serve health care needs but also to preach the gospel, added Hagan. Partnering with an entity that stands in direct philosophical opposition is a breach of the Catholic community's support and trust.D-H has no religious purpose only charitable, scientific and educational.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">CMC, on the other hand, legally exists to carry on the work of the Church under its parent corporation, the Catholic Medical Center Healthcare System (CMCHS), which is a â€œjuridic person of the diocese under canon law.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The agreement calls for the diocese to basically relinquish the hospital's independence, as DHH will become the new sole member of CMC's parent company. A DHH Leadership Council, composed of officials of all its regional members, will have ultimate power over CMC's finances and strategic planning, as well as the appointment of its trustees and president. You can kiss control goodbye if you don't have the votes on the board. Hagan pointed out. It's a corporate shell game as far as I'm concerned. Souza likened the legal reorganization to Russian nested dolls.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The agreement stipulates that Catholic ethical norms will be followed, but also acknowledges that all parties understand sometimes they may not be. In those cases, the Leadership Council gives representatives of CMC and its parent, CMCHS, the chance to recuse herself or himself and have no involvement in such issues. Does that sound like Pope John Paul's˜stand up and proclaim the Gospel? Hagan asked. They'll walk away and not defend the faith.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Among other issues raised in the Memo of Objections is the bishop's absence at the negotiating table. The guidance the bishop's been given comes from an ethicist who's in the compromising position of also being a diocesan employee, the memo notes. Peter Cataldo is both pro-life director for the diocese and a CMC advisor. And although the bishop has said he's consulted two other ethicists as well, he has declined to name them. <br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />
Another objection is the lack of public input during initial planning. CMC and DHH&#160;have been cooperating on joint ventures for more than five years, but the â€œ</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2470&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">holding company affiliation</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;(they're not terming it a merger) was not publicized until February. A few talks between diocesan and hospital officials and invited pro-life leaders did take place this spring, but Souza said these were more of a dog-and-pony show than a serious exchange of information.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We complained to the bishop in writing following each meeting, repeating the same concerns each time, she said. Each reply from the bishop assured us that our worries were unfounded but again&#160; no answers were provided.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Pro-lifers felt the clock was just being allowed to run out. Mistrust on ethics will doom CMC's new affiliation,&#160;predicted former Manchester alderman Rich Gerard in a&#160;July 27-August 2 <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2465&amp;F=H">Manchester Express</a> </em>column. Community forums will be held in the fall, but dates and locations have not been announced yet.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">NHRTL also contends that Dartmouth will rapidly devour CMC, engulfing all of New Hampshire and Vermont. &#160;In a July 25 column in the <em>Concord Monitor</em>,&#160;former New Hampshire state representative Donald Welch agreed. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center is a leader in health-care innovation and care, but its business model is predatory, he observed. It is not interested in being a bridesmaid.&#160; </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2467&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Catholic Medical Center</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> would be an afterthought, its mission and glorious past notwithstanding.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The hospital's roots go back almost 120 years. In the 1890s, Manchester Catholics built two hospitals, both run by religious sisters: Sacred Heart on the city's east side and Notre Dame on the west side. In 1978, the two hospitals combined into CMC.<br />
&#160;<br />
In the 1990s, the hospital merged for a few years with Elliot Hospital of Manchester to form Optima Health, a venture that proved to be ill-conceived, unpopular and unsuccessful. The merger was dissolved; the hospitals continued independently and flourished.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The successful campaign to save Catholic Medical Center from extinction appears not to be appreciated by Giles or her management team, Welch said. It is once again being handled like a financial asset rather than a sacred trust.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Souza and Hagan who helped expose problems inherent in Optima&#160; contend the Manchester plan would create even more of a scandal than the unresolved situation in the Archdiocese of Boston, whose Caritas Christi health care system is still a player with an insurance company that refers women for abortions, contraceptives and sterilizations.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Following much negative publicity, in June, at the 11th hour, Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley did nix the hospital system becoming an outright partner with the company, but he has yet to divulge details of the current plan. He has also declined to release the opinion he sought in March from the NCBC.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Colleen McCormick, an anesthesiologist with a graduate degree in medical ethics, has attended the Manchester talks. Washington is dying to squelch conscience protections, she observed. Once Catholic entities have physicians who have no problems with the culture of death, rights of conscience will be easier to overcome. I think we should be withdrawing from any liaisons at all between Catholic and secular health care providers.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Asked to comment on mergers in general, Father Tadeusz Pacholczyk, director of education for the NCBC, advised, Such mergers can be pursued as long as the Catholic health care provider is clear about the meaning of its Catholic identity and remains intent on upholding that identity in all the negotiations and arrangements leading to the merger and subsequent to its realization. This means that the Catholic institution (and the merged institution later) will be bound by the provisions of the Ethical and Religious Directives. The possibility of scandal must be meticulously avoided.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">By contrast, Hagan said, in this case, the maze of legal documents stipulates that the directives will be followed except when they won't. She added, We're praying that the NCBC and the attorney general's office will conclude, as we have, that this proposed affiliation is an attempt to do the impossible.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">In his 1995 encyclical, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=317&amp;F=H">Evangelium Vitae</a> </em>(<em>The Gospel of Life</em>),&#160;Pope John Paul II was clear:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">[W]e are facing an enormous and dramatic clash between good and evil, death and life, the culture of death and the culture of life.

That's right; he considers it among the most problematic ways to connect with other human beings. As he said, We have voices; we are people; let's communicate that way.<br />
I agree with his general premise. God gave us a voice, a human identity and the capacity to be present with our fellow human beings in many ways. On the other hand, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the ability to use the internet for the purposes of verification. Of course, we have to make phone calls, write letters and do all that is needed to be accurate, but so much information is right at our fingertips.<br /><br />

So the president is right to that limited extent. But it's equally true that House and Senate legislation would allow a new "public" insurance plan to cover abortions, despite language added to the House bill that technically forbids using public funds to pay for them. Obama has said in the past that "reproductive services" would be covered by his public plan, so it's likely that any new federal insurance plan would cover abortion unless Congress expressly prohibits that. Low- and moderate-income persons who would choose the "public plan" would qualify for federal subsidies to purchase it. Private plans that cover abortion also could be purchased with the help of federal subsidies. Therefore, we judge that the president goes too far when he calls the statements that government would be funding abortions "fabrications."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Clearly, in one way or another, abortion is in there. Case closed!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;So, my next question is <em>how many Catholic bishops have clearly defined what the Church has to say about this?</em> Here are quotes from the three we were able to identify.<br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/2440/Archbishop's-Column/"><strong><font size="4">Archbishop Charles Chaput</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> of Denver, the latest Catholic prelate&#160;to weigh in on health care reform,&#160; wrote a remarkable editorial in which he makes several salient points:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">No system that allows or helps fund no matter how subtly or indirectly the killing of unborn children, or discrimination against the elderly and persons with special needs, can bill itself as "common ground." Doing so is a lie.<br /><br />
Health care reform is vital. That's why America's bishops have supported it so vigorously for decades. They still do. But fast-tracking a flawed, complex effort this fall, in the face of so many growing and serious concerns, is bad policy. It's not only imprudent; it's also dangerous. As Sioux City's Bishop R. Walker Nickless wrote last week, "no health care reform is better than the wrong sort of health care reform."&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
If Congress and the White House want to genuinely serve the health-care needs of the American public, they need to slow down, listen to people's concerns more honestly and learn what the "common good" really means.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">And, as referenced in Archbishop Chaput's excellent summary of the facts, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2433&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Bishop R. Walker Nickless</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> of Sioux City, Iowa, was equally articulate in his remarks:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">[T]he Catholic Church does not teach that â€œhealth care as such, without distinction, is a natural right. The natural right of health care is the divine bounty of food, water, and air without which all of us quickly die. This bounty comes from God directly. None of us own it, and none of us can morally withhold it from others. The remainder of health care is a political, not a natural, right, because it comes from our human efforts, creativity and compassion. As a political right, health care should be apportioned according to need, not ability to pay or to benefit from the care. We reject the rationing of care. Those who are sickest should get the most care, regardless of age, status, or wealth. But how to do this is not self-evident. The decisions that we must collectively make about how to administer health care therefore fall under â€œprudential judgment.<br /><br />
Third, in that category of prudential judgment, the Catholic Church does not teach that government should directly provide health care. Unlike a prudential concern like national defense, for which government monopolization is objectively good&#160;as it both limits violence overall and prevents the obvious abuses to which private armies are susceptible health care should not be subject to federal monopolization. Preserving patient choice (through a flourishing private sector) is the only way to prevent a health care monopoly from denying care arbitrarily, as we learned from HMOs in the recent past.<br /><br />
Only if we again foster a culture of life can we perpetuate the economic justice of taxing workers to pay health care for the poor. Without a growing population of youth, our growing population of retirees is outstripping our distribution systems. In a culture of death such as we have now, taxation to redistribute costs of medical care becomes both unjust and unsustainable.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;We also have </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2312&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Bishop Robert Vasa</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> of Baker, Oregon, responding to LifeSiteNews.com after it approached him for an e-mail interview. A portion of that interview reads,&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Vasa noted that he believes "the notion of providing more comprehensive health insurance coverage is a just and right thing to do." However, he said: "that does not mean that THIS health insurance plan, only because it promises comprehensive health insurance coverage, must be supported.<br /><br />
"In effect, should we support giving poisoned water to the thirsty? I think not."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The insights of these holy men of God, who understand the stakes and are willing to spend their moral capital on God's justice rather than man's feckless, ever-changing attitudes, should be acknowledged, reflected upon and understood within the full breadth of Catholic social teaching.<br /><br />
As Bishop Nickless points out, some have argued that abortion is a fundamental human right. In a sense, the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2426&amp;F=H">Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church</a></em> addresses that notion. Here is the quote:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">166. The demands of the common good are dependent on the social conditions of each historical period and are strictly connected to respect for and the integral promotion of the person and his fundamental rights. These demands concern above all the commitment to peace, the organization of the State's powers, a sound juridical system, the protection of the environment, and the provision of essential services to all, some of which are at the same time human rights: food, housing, work, education and access to culture, transportation, basic health care, the freedom of communication and expression, and the protection of religious freedom. Nor must one forget the contribution that every nation is required in duty to make towards a true worldwide cooperation for the common good of the whole of humanity and for future generations also.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The teaching is not that a state or federal government should be controlling or dictating health care for those in need, for the <em>Compendium</em> teaches in Section 351, The action of the State and of other public authorities must be consistent with the principle of subsidiarity and create situations favorable to the free exercise of economic activity. It must also be inspired by the principle of solidarity and establish limits for the autonomy of the parties in order to defend those who are weaker.<br />
Therefore, for those who have recognized the folks currently in charge of the U.S. government for what they are, based on their partnership with Planned Parenthood, the abortion industry and the death with dignity proponents, we can conclude that health care reform in the hands of federal lawmakers is a very bad idea.<br /><br />

The hard truth, the inconvenient truth, is that the violence perpetrated against Pouillon and the second victim of their killer, Harlan Drake, is but another example of how far too many people view problems and troublesome events in their lives these days. For 36 years, this nation has sanctioned the direct murder of innocent babies prior to birth and defined that massacre of the innocents as a right, a decision to be made between a woman and her doctor. The truth about abortion has been rejected by millions. Even President Barack Obama doesn't get it or refuses to see the grim reality of just how damning abortion advocacy in America has become.&#160; </span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt"><o:p></o:p></span></font></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><font size="4"><span style="font-size: small"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana">Violence is, indeed, never the right answer!

Pouillon did this not for any publicity that he might gain, not for a place in history and certainly not for the applause he would hear from the thousands who would line the streets to cheer him on in life and mourn the great loss of his contribution to society in his death.

This is also why we now must prayâ€”for our nation, for Pouillon's surviving family and for the courage to carry on in his memory for the millions of little ones who have died.

Excerpts from <em>The Winning Side</em> by Charles E. Rice</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">After declining to decide whether an unborn child is a living human being, the Supreme Court ruled that he is not a person, since the “the word ‘person,’ as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.” Regardless of whether he is a human being, he is not a person. This ruling is the same, in effect, as ruling that an acknowledged human being is a nonperson. As a nonperson, the unborn child has no more constitutional rights than does a goldfish or a turnip.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Once the Court ruled out the rights of the unborn nonperson, the only right remaining was the mother’s right to privacy. While asserting that this right is not absolute, the Court defined it so as to permit, in effect, elective abortion at every stage of pregnancy up to the time of normal delivery.&#160; According to <em>Roe</em>, even after viability, when the state may regulate and even prohibit abortion, the state may not prohibit abortion “where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.” The health of the mother includes her psychological as well as physical well-being. And “the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors – physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age – relevant to the well-being of the mother. This is equivalent to a sanction for permissive abortion at every stage of pregnancy.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The essential holding of <em>Roe</em> is that the unborn child is not a “person” within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects the right to life of persons.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">But, you ask, hasn’t the Court retreated from its holding in <em>Roe</em>? Not really. Since 1973, the Court has upheld marginal restrictions on abortion, such as a requirement that abortions be performed by physicians. In 1992, in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em>, the Court upheld Pennsylvania requirements that the woman be given information about abortion 24 hours before the abortion; that a minor have the consent of a least one of her parents, or the approval of a judge, before she can have an abortion; and that abortion facilities comply with record keeping and reporting requirements. But the Court struck down a requirement that the woman notify her spouse before the abortion.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">The Court in <em>Casey</em> described the woman’s right to an abortion as a “liberty interest” protected under the Fourteenth Amendment rather than as an exercise of the right to privacy. “[L]iberty as conceived in <em>Casey</em> is broader than privacy as conceived in <em>Roe</em>. But the shift has significant substantive ramifications as well … Abortion as privacy, for instance, means that women are protected against governmental intrusion but can make no claim to governmental assistance. Abortion as a liberty issues, on the other hand, permits a broader understanding of abortion that more accurately reflects the multiple meanings of reproductive rights … By identifying abortion as part of a more general liberty interest, the Court raised the stature of the abortion decision.”</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">In 1997, the Court described its <em>Casey</em> ruling as follows: “There, the Court’s opinion concluded that ‘the essential holding of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> should be retained and once again reaffirmed.’&#160; We held, first, that a woman has a right, before her fetus is viable, to an abortion, without undue interference from the State, second, that States may restrict post viability abortions, so long as exceptions are made to protect a woman’s life and health; and third, that the State has legitimate interests throughout a pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child.”</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4">Although the Court allows marginal restrictions on abortion, the Court will not allow the states to enact any effective prohibition of abortion at any stage or pregnancy. The Court requires that the states allow abortion for emotional as well as physical health even up to the time of normal delivery.&#160; The Court has also imposed sever restrictions on pro-life activities at abortion sites.</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><br /><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="4">News</font></strong></p><p class="heading"><strong><font size="4"><em>Preliminary injunction granted in IL conscience case — Pharmacists score a win in long battle for their rights</em><br />

In one day, her health plummeted.<br /><br />
"I woke up last Thursday morning with shortness of breath. I actually tried to work out that morning, and I had to stop because I could not breathe. Then, I actually coughed up a little blood so that was alarming, but being 28 and healthy, I just didn't really think much of it, she said.<br /><br />
But the pain got worse and at the urging of her mom, who is a nurse, she checked herself into the emergency room. A CAT scan revealed blood clots in her lungs.<br /><br />
"When I was in the ER they came in and said you have multiple in both lungs and that was shocking. It wasn't just like I had one. I had multiple. I said "Well, how many is multiple"? and he said, "I can't really count them". He told me if I did not come to the emergency room when I did, I could've died instantly, she said.<br /><br />

Today, it is my sincere privilege to provide you with what is the last word on the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy's funeral. Rev. Brian Harrison holds a doctorate in systematic theology, and is a well-known writer and speaker. He is also among the most faithful, inspiring Catholic priests I know.&#160;<br /><br />
It is my hope that you will appreciate his words as much as I appreciate bringing them to you. Please note, below it,&#160;the two canons from the Code of Canon Law that should have been applied by the prelates who made decisions regarding funeral rites for Senator Kennedy.<br /><br />
The following is&#160;Father Harrison's commentary. (An adapted version was posted by </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=353&amp;L=2523&amp;F=H"><em><strong><font size="4">LifeSiteNews.com</font></strong></em></a><strong><font size="4">.)</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">As a Roman Catholic priest, I feel a duty in conscience today to register, to the couple of hundred people to whom I have ready access, my emphatic dissent from a message that was projected around the nation and the globe this morning to millions of viewers and listeners by certain other members of the Roman Catholic clergy.<br /><br />
Kennedy's Funeral Mass is a Scandal<br /><br />
I refer to this morning's televised funeral Mass, celebrated in Boston's Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, for the recently deceased Senator Edward Moore Kennedy. It was a Mass I regard as a scandal comparable to, if not worse than, the scandal given several months ago when the nations most prestigious Catholic university bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Barack Hussein Obama, the most pro-abortion and â€œpro-gay president in U.S. history.<br /><br />
Why, you ask, should a Catholic priest raise such objections to a Catholic funeral for a Catholic legislator? Well, I am afraid this funeral was no ordinary Catholic funeral.<br /><br />
&#160;For to those innumerable viewers and listeners of many religions (or none) who were aware of Senator Kennedy's public, straightforward, radical, longstanding, and (as far as we know) unrepented defiance of his own Church's firm teaching about the duty of legislators to protect unborn human life and resist the militant homosexual agenda, this mornings Mass, concelebrated by several priests, presided over by Cardinal Sean O'Malley, archbishop of Boston, and adorned by a eulogy from the aforesaid U.S. president, effectively communicated a tacit but very clear message: The Church does not really take too seriously her own official doctrines on these matters! <br />
I feel impelled, therefore, to make known, to anyone willing to read these lines, that there are many other representatives of the Catholic Church, such as the undersigned, who take those doctrines very seriously indeed.<br /><br />
How would our Church leaders act if they really did take seriously an official Church position from which a prominent deceased Catholic had publicly dissented? <br /><br />
To answer that question, we need only imagine a situation in which some well-known Catholic legislator had, for years, supported the Church's social teaching across the board, in regard to human life, marriage, compassion toward the poor and underprivileged, etc., but had then, in old age, lapsed into supporting some ideological position that was strongly opposed not only by the Church, but also by the dominant Western elites in government, law, education, commerce and the media.<br /><br />
Suppose, for instance, that he had come to endorse white supremacism or Holocaust denial. Now, when the moment for this Catholic legislators funeral came, could we imagine for one moment that our cardinals, bishops and other leading clergy, mindful of this man's sterling and thoroughly orthodox contributions to the common good over so many years in Congress, would compassionately overlook his latter-day lapse into racism or anti-Semitism?<br /><br />
Would they agree to give him a free pass in regard to this defect? Would they speak and act as if it were nonexistent? Would they grant him a televised funeral Mass in a large basilica, presided over by a cardinal, in which he would be publicly eulogized by both family and public figures?<br /><br />
These questions really answer themselves. Of course none of that would occur! The local bishop might go as far as to allow our hypothetical Catholic racist or anti-Semite a Church funeral, if it was known that (like Senator Kennedy) he had confessed sacramentally to a priest before death.<br /><br />
However, the bishop would allow the use of Church property for this funeral on the strict condition that only close personal family and friends would be admitted. All media transmission or even presence during the service itself would surely be forbidden. (It would, of course, be unnecessary for the bishop to ask his fellow bishops and other high Church dignitaries not to attend the service; for all of them, like the bishop himself, would already prefer to be anywhere else on earth than at the funeral of one who had lapsed so unspeakably from society's ruling canons of acceptable behavior.)<br /><br />
Yes, society's canons. There, I am afraid, lies the difference between our two scenarios. <br /><br />
Is it that official Catholic doctrine is incomparably more opposed to racism and anti-Semitism than it is to abortion and sodomy? Not at all. The big difference is simply that most members of the Catholic hierarchy in Western society today&#160; and there are, of course, a number of honorable exceptions are lacking in prophetic courage. They are ready and eager to take vigorous and resolute public disciplinary action only against those deviations from Church teaching which also happen to be excoriated by the cultural and media elites.<br /><br />
But if it is our prelates themselves who will be excoriated by those elites as would certainly have occurred had they required for Ted Kennedy's funeral the kind of severe restraint we envisaged above for that of our hypothetical bigot then all eagerness for just discipline will evaporate as fast as dew in the morning sun. Pastoral compassion, forgiveness, tolerant respect and Christian charity will now be instantly invoked as reasons for cloaking in total silence the public enormities committed decade after decade by an ecclesially heterodox but socially orthodox legislator.<br /><br />
So, It's St. Kennedy Now?<br /><br />
So it was, in this mornings funeral Mass, that the homilist, Fr. Mark Hession (pastor of Kennedy's Cape Cod parish), made his sermon a eulogy about what a wonderful Catholic Christian Ted was, assuring us that we could be confident that he is already with Jesus in glory. <br /><br />
So it was that the principal celebrant, Fr. Donald Monan, SJ, chancellor of Boston College, not only repeatedly told those present and the whole watching world that Senator Kennedy was a man of â€œfaith and prayer, with a deep devotion to the Eucharist, but also assured us that this faith and prayer in private was precisely what inspired and motivated his public policies, so that there was (surprise, surprise) a real integration and unity between his private and public life!<br /><br />
Well, a lot of us didn't quite manage to see any private-public unity based on Roman Catholic principles. On the contrary, Kennedy's huge political influence, based on both the family's prestige and the personal dynamism of this Lion of the Senate, if anything, made his U-turn on abortion (yes, he was pro-life in his younger days) an even more scandalous counterwitness: a sign of conflict, not union, with that Church to which he professed loyalty.<br /><br />
Here are two comments I have just lifted off a Catholic blog:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 80px"><strong><font size="4">1. There's this big,˜What if? said Catholic author Michael Sean Winters. If Ted Kennedy had stuck to his pro-life position, would both the (Democratic) Party and the country have embraced the abortion on demand policies that we have now? I don't think so.<br /><br />
2. Russell Shaw, former spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that when Kennedy defied the Church on issues such as abortion and later, gay marriage, he reinforced a corrosive belief among Catholics that they can simply ignore teachings they don't agree with.</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Public Scandal Is Grave Matter<br /><br />
I myself remember, several years ago, a conversation with a young woman who had been brought up Catholic but had recently been born again as an Evangelical Protestant. One of the arguments she threw at me was, Even your Church leaders don't really believe what Catholics are supposed to believe. Why don't they excommunicate Ted Kennedy? He's blatantly, 100% pro-choice! Yet they do nothing!<br />
What could I say to her? And what can I say now, after today's public scandal? That young lady's complaint was simply that this man remained a Catholic in good standing. I find I must now complain to you of something worse. <br /><br />
Before the whole world this morning, my fellow Catholic clerics in Boston did not just accord him the good standing of a normal, flawed Catholic whose soul we can hope is in Purgatory. Rather, clad in triumphant white vestments instead of penitential violet (never mind the traditional black!), they have placed him on a pedestal, granting him an unofficial instant canonization!<br /><br />
Scripture Warns Us<br /><br />
The Church's teaching is already abundantly clear that all this is very wrong. So perhaps we can legitimately discern the hand of God's Providence, which rules all things, in a coincidence that suggests a manifestation of God's grave displeasure at this kind of mockery injustice masquerading as â€œpastoral charity. <br /><br />
In our liturgy, Sunday has begun as I write at the hour of Vespers on Saturday. But the earlier part of this day, August 29, including the time of the Kennedy funeral, was observed by Catholics around the world as the Feast of the Beheading of St.&#160;John the Baptist. In normal Masses celebrated today, the biblical account of his martyrdom was read (Mark 6: 17,29.) The parallels are striking: (a) We see two powerful civil authorities; (b) both of them flip-flop in a morally bad direction (Herod originally respected and defended John, and Kennedy originally respected and defended the unborn); and (c) both of them abuse their power by authorizing the shedding of innocent blood.<br /><br />
As if that were not enough, the longest Scripture reading in todayâ€™s liturgy also grabs our attention. It is prescribed not for the Feast of John the Baptist, but independently, for the Saturday of Week 21, in the Office of Readings. This is a part of the daily Liturgy of the Hours, which is required spiritual reading for us Roman Rite clerics. And todays reading just happens to be Jeremiah 7: 1:20, in which the prophet vigorously denounces&#160; guess what? The hypocrisy of Israels religious leaders who proudly identify with the temple and the rites they celebrate within it, while at the same time they are living unrighteously (including shedding innocent blood, verse 6) and even pouring out libations to strange gods (verse 18). God therefore warns, {My anger and my wrath will pour out upon this place} (verse 20). <br />
Orthodox Catholics will surely ask whether God can be any less angered now by those clerics who today carried out temple rites giving undeserved honor to a legislator who, for decade after decade, poured out the libations of his eloquence, influence and Senate votes in the service the â€œfalse gods of Planned Parenthood and NARAL which regularly rewarded him with 100% ratings for his pro-choice record.<br /><br />
Enough. If, in your charity, you pray for God to be merciful to the soul of Edward Moore Kennedy, please pray for all of us Catholic priests as well and be cognizant of the fact that some of us are profoundly indignant at what we saw our brethren doing today.<br /><br />

But this devil is also a chameleon, created in a very crafty fashion.<br /><br />
Anyone who has experience with negotiating labor contracts as does the writer is well aware that vague language or no mention of an issue ultimately leads to the need for interpretation. What is implied in the wording becomes the real focus. Its meaning is interpreted by one party's own appointed bureaucrats, a favorable regulator or by judge-shopping within the judicial system. The tack which all of these people will take has been predetermined, so this is at the core of the administration's modus operandi.<br /><br />
This bill is, in part, about putting an indelible stamp on abortion as a way of death. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are also included by implication in this health package; otherwise, they would have been explicitly excluded. The true test of the Obama administration's intent lies in the wording. The gaggle of attorneys surrounding President Barack Obama are well aware of how to write clear-cut language that would allow no wiggle room and would convey sincerity. Likewise, along party lines and with his support, the Democrats have steadfastly voted down amendments that would protect the right to life of innocent human beings across the entire life spectrum. The intent of Obama and his supporters has been made crystal clear.<br /><br />
In stark contrast, as a presidential candidate, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=236&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> did use very clear language in his promises to the abortion industry. He said he would sign into law the Freedom of Choice Act&#160; and support abortion in every instance, including </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2483&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">partial-birth abortion</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">.&#160;He deemed clarity to be essential then. But now he is resorting to self-righteous verbal tap-dancing while charging at town-hall meetings that his opponents are trying </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2485&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">to scare and mislead the public</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">.&#160;Who is trying to mislead whom?<br /><br />
Fresh from being honored by this country's best-known Catholic university, the president has informed the leading abortion providers that, in view of the heat generated by Catholic opponents to his award from Notre Dame, he will forego a heads-on approach to FOCA. Why not? The same end can now be attained incrementally through passage of this health care reform legislation. <br />
Although he was careful to not select a single individual with a pro-life background for a high-level position, he has nominated many who profess to be Catholic. This was part of the design. It provides cover in the shell game being played to convert this massive health care package into law and codify abortion on demand by an indirect route.<br /><br />
As part of its push, the administration has loosened the purse strings to fund organizations such as </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2112&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Catholic Charities</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;and other front groups featuring </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2477&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Catholic</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> in their name or whose name clearly implies a </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2083&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Catholic</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> identity.&#160;They willingly respond by acting as salespeople trumpeting the need for passing the entire package, using moral arguments weighing heavily in favor of obtaining coverage for the millions now uninsured.&#160;The pitch is always cloaked in Christian-sounding generalities, rather than specifics. At first blush, it sounds compassionate, but it withers away quickly when challenged on substance. All of it is leftist demagoguery repackaged.&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />
Though he was too ill to&#160;attend his sister Eunice's funeral, the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy was nonetheless exploited (apparently with family approval) to promote what is essentially a power grab. Unfortunately, Senator Kennedy apparently did not focus on ensuring that the health care overhaul would respect the right to life of all human beings, from creation to natural death as he should have done in his waning days, in reparation for his many years of abortion advocacy.<br /><br />
Instead, the proposal is fraught with unanswered questions about the motives behind it and its ultimate consequences. What a sad scenario! I contacted Senator Kennedy's Washington office to propose the following wording in the Senate version: The intent of this legislation is to promote the health of all human beings. Nothing in the wording shall be construed to include counseling for or the funding of abortion, euthanasia or assisted suicide.<br />
If this 1,100-plus-page document or even one with only 600 words is passed, Obama's advisors and bureaucrats will start chipping away to undermine and ultimately destroy conscience clauses as well as parental consent requirements, waiting periods and every other restriction on the destruction of life in utero. <br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2481&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> is clearly feticidal and infanticidal as well. He proved it as the Illinois state senator who voted three times to deny medical care to a child born alive as a result of a failed attempt to abort him or her.&#160;And </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=347&amp;L=2482&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Obama</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;expressly voiced the belief that a Supreme Court opinion cut out of whole cloth in 1973 took precedence over any right to life one could claim for a defenseless human being in need of medical care if the intent was to legally end the life of that human being. <br /><br />
Abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide are not health care.&#160;Each stops a beating human heart permanently. Health care is designed to keep that heart beating until it ceases to function on its own. We now have the hearts of over a million humans stopped legally each year. That figure would grow drastically under Obamacare. Yes, where this man wants to take the country is a very scary place.<br /><br />
The primary issue in the entire health care debate is not whether some reform is needed; it is how we should approach the issue through&#160;a blanket overhaul or by breaking down the effort into its component parts and addressing them individually? Moreover, if explicitly worded exclusions for abortion, assisted suicide or euthanasia counseling and/or funding are not added to the legislation, any deal must be broken before it moves to a conference committee on which the administration is heavily relying to accomplish its goals.<br /><br />
The president of the United States has an atrocious record of disregard for preborn babies human dignity and&#160;right to life, which logically leads to the conclusion that he harbors the same&#160;attitude toward&#160;the defenseless elderly and infirm. <br /><br />
Obama must be held to a moral standard far superior to that which he has thus far displayed toward&#160;life-and-death matters.&#160;He is showing all his cards in H.R. 3200 and gives us no alternative but to vigorously oppose this bill and defeat it. Our efforts cannot be relaxed until this is accomplished.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br />

The bishop has the ultimate say over its fate, and he's putting himself in the position of being undercut. His powers are either diluted or eliminated throughout the agreement.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Souza and Hagan, on behalf of NHRTL and the pro-life community in greater Manchester, on August 11 filed a formal Memo of Opposition with the charitable trusts division of the New Hampshire attorney general's office.

D-H doctors have testified in the state legislature against the diocese on end-of-life issues, Souza explained.

He declined to answer questions posed by American Life League about it, or to meet with several concerned&#160;pro-life actvisits,&#160;despite their repeated requests this spring.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">According to a statement on </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2470&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">AHealthierTomorrow.org</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;(a web site unveiled July 22 to explain the plan), the goal is to create an integrated healthcare delivery system that maximizes Manchester-based resources aimed at increasing access to enhanced quality patient care.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Bishop </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2472&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">McCormack</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> has stated, As bishop, I am committed to preserve Catholic Medical Center to be a true Catholic healthcare institution, one that fulfills all the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic hospitals.&#160;&#160;He is referring to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2404&amp;F=H">Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care</a></em>.&#160;Part Six of this document, titled a Forming New Partnerships with Health Care Organizations and Providers, provides norms for guiding the faithful through the dangers inherent in Catholic-secular hospital mergers and other minefields. It notes, The risk of scandal cannot be underestimated when partnerships are not built upon common values and moral principles.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">But since the plan was announced, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2473&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">DHH</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;officials have been consistent. There will be no curtailment of its reproductive services such as contraception and abortion, according to repeated statements to the media provided by spokesman Jason Aldous and other DHH officials.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Where's the truth? Black can't be white and white can't be black, said Souza. A Catholic institution doesn't only have an obligation to serve health care needs but also to preach the gospel, added Hagan. Partnering with an entity that stands in direct philosophical opposition is a breach of the Catholic community's support and trust.D-H has no religious purpose only charitable, scientific and educational.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">CMC, on the other hand, legally exists to carry on the work of the Church under its parent corporation, the Catholic Medical Center Healthcare System (CMCHS), which is a â€œjuridic person of the diocese under canon law.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The agreement calls for the diocese to basically relinquish the hospital's independence, as DHH will become the new sole member of CMC's parent company. A DHH Leadership Council, composed of officials of all its regional members, will have ultimate power over CMC's finances and strategic planning, as well as the appointment of its trustees and president. You can kiss control goodbye if you don't have the votes on the board. Hagan pointed out. It's a corporate shell game as far as I'm concerned. Souza likened the legal reorganization to Russian nested dolls.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The agreement stipulates that Catholic ethical norms will be followed, but also acknowledges that all parties understand sometimes they may not be. In those cases, the Leadership Council gives representatives of CMC and its parent, CMCHS, the chance to recuse herself or himself and have no involvement in such issues. Does that sound like Pope John Paul's˜stand up and proclaim the Gospel? Hagan asked. They'll walk away and not defend the faith.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Among other issues raised in the Memo of Objections is the bishop's absence at the negotiating table. The guidance the bishop's been given comes from an ethicist who's in the compromising position of also being a diocesan employee, the memo notes. Peter Cataldo is both pro-life director for the diocese and a CMC advisor. And although the bishop has said he's consulted two other ethicists as well, he has declined to name them. <br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />
Another objection is the lack of public input during initial planning. CMC and DHH&#160;have been cooperating on joint ventures for more than five years, but the â€œ</font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2470&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">holding company affiliation</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">&#160;(they're not terming it a merger) was not publicized until February. A few talks between diocesan and hospital officials and invited pro-life leaders did take place this spring, but Souza said these were more of a dog-and-pony show than a serious exchange of information.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">We complained to the bishop in writing following each meeting, repeating the same concerns each time, she said. Each reply from the bishop assured us that our worries were unfounded but again&#160; no answers were provided.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Pro-lifers felt the clock was just being allowed to run out. Mistrust on ethics will doom CMC's new affiliation,&#160;predicted former Manchester alderman Rich Gerard in a&#160;July 27-August 2 <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2465&amp;F=H">Manchester Express</a> </em>column. Community forums will be held in the fall, but dates and locations have not been announced yet.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">NHRTL also contends that Dartmouth will rapidly devour CMC, engulfing all of New Hampshire and Vermont. &#160;In a July 25 column in the <em>Concord Monitor</em>,&#160;former New Hampshire state representative Donald Welch agreed. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center is a leader in health-care innovation and care, but its business model is predatory, he observed. It is not interested in being a bridesmaid.&#160; </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=2467&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Catholic Medical Center</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> would be an afterthought, its mission and glorious past notwithstanding.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The hospital's roots go back almost 120 years. In the 1890s, Manchester Catholics built two hospitals, both run by religious sisters: Sacred Heart on the city's east side and Notre Dame on the west side. In 1978, the two hospitals combined into CMC.<br />
&#160;<br />
In the 1990s, the hospital merged for a few years with Elliot Hospital of Manchester to form Optima Health, a venture that proved to be ill-conceived, unpopular and unsuccessful. The merger was dissolved; the hospitals continued independently and flourished.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The successful campaign to save Catholic Medical Center from extinction appears not to be appreciated by Giles or her management team, Welch said. It is once again being handled like a financial asset rather than a sacred trust.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Souza and Hagan who helped expose problems inherent in Optima&#160; contend the Manchester plan would create even more of a scandal than the unresolved situation in the Archdiocese of Boston, whose Caritas Christi health care system is still a player with an insurance company that refers women for abortions, contraceptives and sterilizations.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Following much negative publicity, in June, at the 11th hour, Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley did nix the hospital system becoming an outright partner with the company, but he has yet to divulge details of the current plan. He has also declined to release the opinion he sought in March from the NCBC.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Colleen McCormick, an anesthesiologist with a graduate degree in medical ethics, has attended the Manchester talks. Washington is dying to squelch conscience protections, she observed. Once Catholic entities have physicians who have no problems with the culture of death, rights of conscience will be easier to overcome. I think we should be withdrawing from any liaisons at all between Catholic and secular health care providers.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Asked to comment on mergers in general, Father Tadeusz Pacholczyk, director of education for the NCBC, advised, Such mergers can be pursued as long as the Catholic health care provider is clear about the meaning of its Catholic identity and remains intent on upholding that identity in all the negotiations and arrangements leading to the merger and subsequent to its realization. This means that the Catholic institution (and the merged institution later) will be bound by the provisions of the Ethical and Religious Directives. The possibility of scandal must be meticulously avoided.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">By contrast, Hagan said, in this case, the maze of legal documents stipulates that the directives will be followed except when they won't. She added, We're praying that the NCBC and the attorney general's office will conclude, as we have, that this proposed affiliation is an attempt to do the impossible.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">In his 1995 encyclical, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=346&amp;L=317&amp;F=H">Evangelium Vitae</a> </em>(<em>The Gospel of Life</em>),&#160;Pope John Paul II was clear:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">[W]e are facing an enormous and dramatic clash between good and evil, death and life, the culture of death and the culture of life.

First, blind to the destruction of the embryo itself-they argue embryonic stem cell research will save lives. Second, they maintain that embryos leftover from fertility treatments will otherwise be wasted. Now, one stem-cell expert is using these same arguments to promote harvesting organs from aborted fetuses.<br />

That's right; he considers it among the most problematic ways to connect with other human beings. As he said, We have voices; we are people; let's communicate that way.<br />
I agree with his general premise. God gave us a voice, a human identity and the capacity to be present with our fellow human beings in many ways. On the other hand, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the ability to use the internet for the purposes of verification. Of course, we have to make phone calls, write letters and do all that is needed to be accurate, but so much information is right at our fingertips.<br /><br />
Having said that, it is strange that there is so much crossfire on what is or is not in health care reform proposals! And why all the name calling? And for heaven's sake, at the end of the day, why are we trusting the government to do this anyway?<br /><br />
Here a few facts about the matter, some numerical, some philosophical and some simply profound.<br />
For example, have you ever heard of </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2431&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">FactCheck.org</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4">?&#160;Thanks to <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=9&amp;F=H">LifeSiteNews.com</a></em>&#160;and <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2429&amp;F=H">LifeNews.com</a></em>,&#160; we heard about it two days ago. So we went to the source to find out what an organization that describes itself as a nonpartisan, nonprofit consumer advocate for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics is saying about health care reform.<br />
&#160;<br />
In its front-page analysis of whether abortion coverage is included in the various </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2430&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">health care reform</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> bills, titled Abortion: Which Side is Fabricating?&#160;author Brooks Jackson makes this stunning observation:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">The truth is that bills now before Congress don't require federal money to be used for supporting abortion coverage. So the president is right to that limited extent. But it's equally true that House and Senate legislation would allow a new "public" insurance plan to cover abortions, despite language added to the House bill that technically forbids using public funds to pay for them. Obama has said in the past that "reproductive services" would be covered by his public plan, so it's likely that any new federal insurance plan would cover abortion unless Congress expressly prohibits that. Low- and moderate-income persons who would choose the "public plan" would qualify for federal subsidies to purchase it. Private plans that cover abortion also could be purchased with the help of federal subsidies. Therefore, we judge that the president goes too far when he calls the statements that government would be funding abortions "fabrications."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">Clearly, in one way or another, abortion is in there. Case closed!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;So, my next question is <em>how many Catholic bishops have clearly defined what the Church has to say about this?</em> Here are quotes from the three we were able to identify.<br /><br /></font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/2440/Archbishop's-Column/"><strong><font size="4">Archbishop Charles Chaput</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> of Denver, the latest Catholic prelate&#160;to weigh in on health care reform,&#160; wrote a remarkable editorial in which he makes several salient points:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">No system that allows or helps fund no matter how subtly or indirectly the killing of unborn children, or discrimination against the elderly and persons with special needs, can bill itself as "common ground." Doing so is a lie.<br /><br />
Health care reform is vital. That's why America's bishops have supported it so vigorously for decades. They still do. But fast-tracking a flawed, complex effort this fall, in the face of so many growing and serious concerns, is bad policy. It's not only imprudent; it's also dangerous. As Sioux City's Bishop R. Walker Nickless wrote last week, "no health care reform is better than the wrong sort of health care reform."&#160; <br />
&#160;<br />
If Congress and the White House want to genuinely serve the health-care needs of the American public, they need to slow down, listen to people's concerns more honestly and learn what the "common good" really means.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">And, as referenced in Archbishop Chaput's excellent summary of the facts, </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2433&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Bishop R. Walker Nickless</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> of Sioux City, Iowa, was equally articulate in his remarks:</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">[T]he Catholic Church does not teach that â€œhealth care as such, without distinction, is a natural right. The natural right of health care is the divine bounty of food, water, and air without which all of us quickly die. This bounty comes from God directly. None of us own it, and none of us can morally withhold it from others. The remainder of health care is a political, not a natural, right, because it comes from our human efforts, creativity and compassion. As a political right, health care should be apportioned according to need, not ability to pay or to benefit from the care. We reject the rationing of care. Those who are sickest should get the most care, regardless of age, status, or wealth. But how to do this is not self-evident. The decisions that we must collectively make about how to administer health care therefore fall under â€œprudential judgment.<br /><br />
Third, in that category of prudential judgment, the Catholic Church does not teach that government should directly provide health care. Unlike a prudential concern like national defense, for which government monopolization is objectively good&#160;as it both limits violence overall and prevents the obvious abuses to which private armies are susceptible health care should not be subject to federal monopolization. Preserving patient choice (through a flourishing private sector) is the only way to prevent a health care monopoly from denying care arbitrarily, as we learned from HMOs in the recent past.<br /><br />
Only if we again foster a culture of life can we perpetuate the economic justice of taxing workers to pay health care for the poor. Without a growing population of youth, our growing population of retirees is outstripping our distribution systems. In a culture of death such as we have now, taxation to redistribute costs of medical care becomes both unjust and unsustainable.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">&#160;We also have </font></strong><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2312&amp;F=H"><strong><font size="4">Bishop Robert Vasa</font></strong></a><strong><font size="4"> of Baker, Oregon, responding to LifeSiteNews.com after it approached him for an e-mail interview. A portion of that interview reads,&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">Vasa noted that he believes "the notion of providing more comprehensive health insurance coverage is a just and right thing to do." However, he said: "that does not mean that THIS health insurance plan, only because it promises comprehensive health insurance coverage, must be supported.<br /><br />
"In effect, should we support giving poisoned water to the thirsty? I think not."</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The insights of these holy men of God, who understand the stakes and are willing to spend their moral capital on God's justice rather than man's feckless, ever-changing attitudes, should be acknowledged, reflected upon and understood within the full breadth of Catholic social teaching.<br /><br />
As Bishop Nickless points out, some have argued that abortion is a fundamental human right. In a sense, the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://ss.all.org/link.php?M=17565&amp;N=342&amp;L=2426&amp;F=H">Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church</a></em> addresses that notion. Here is the quote:&#160;</font></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><font size="4">166. The demands of the common good are dependent on the social conditions of each historical period and are strictly connected to respect for and the integral promotion of the person and his fundamental rights. These demands concern above all the commitment to peace, the organization of the State's powers, a sound juridical system, the protection of the environment, and the provision of essential services to all, some of which are at the same time human rights: food, housing, work, education and access to culture, transportation, basic health care, the freedom of communication and expression, and the protection of religious freedom. Nor must one forget the contribution that every nation is required in duty to make towards a true worldwide cooperation for the common good of the whole of humanity and for future generations also.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">The teaching is not that a state or federal government should be controlling or dictating health care for those in need, for the <em>Compendium</em> teaches in Section 351, The action of the State and of other public authorities must be consistent with the principle of subsidiarity and create situations favorable to the free exercise of economic activity. It must also be inspired by the principle of solidarity and establish limits for the autonomy of the parties in order to defend those who are weaker.<br />
Therefore, for those who have recognized the folks currently in charge of the U.S. government for what they are, based on their partnership with Planned Parenthood, the abortion industry and the death with dignity proponents, we can conclude that health care reform in the hands of federal lawmakers is a very bad idea.<br /><br />
