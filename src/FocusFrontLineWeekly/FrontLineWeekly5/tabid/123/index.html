As we were going down Gibbs St. we turned the corner to get to the Killing Mill, Planned Parenthood &amp; there were about&#160;20 pro abortion people waiting for us.&#160; It must have been pretty awesome for them to see 100 people turn the corner.&#160; It was a sad sight to behold to see all these angry people hooping &amp; hollering&#160; &amp; chanting phrases like "keep your Rosaries off of my ovaries".&#160; Even the guys, with no ovaries, were saying&#160;this phrase.&#160;&#160;They are so indoctrinated by the females that have had an abortion &amp; have not repented yet.&#160; They didn't know what they were talking about.&#160; It was very sad.&#160; The pro lifers sang 'Amazing Grace" &amp; said the&#160; 'Hail Mary' prayer &amp; the 'Chaplet of Divine Mercy' &amp; the prayer to 'St. Michael', for protection from the Evil One.&#160; One of the young men was holding the crucifix from Our Lady of Victory Church &amp;&#160;he said "I'll stay here all night if I have to".&#160; What a sweet young man, great job Scott &amp; Mary.&#160; I spoke to&#160;the anti life side,&#160;at times,&#160;&amp; after about a&#160;1/2 hour&#160;later I went into the center to get out the graphic signs, of the babies that were murdered by abortion.&#160; As I was showing the signs 2 people, on the pro choice side,&#160;left pretty quickly.&#160; One of the girls, who was screaming with the pro abortion group, went to her car &amp; came out with a sign that read " I don't regret my abortion".&#160; It made my stomach sick, how very sad.&#160; But after awhile I think, through the grace of God, she mellowed.&#160; As the Marchers went into the Focus Pregnancy Help center to get warmed up &amp; to get fed one of the pro lifers &amp; I stayed a little while longer outside, to the dismay of the police, because they were very cold.&#160; The pro lifer invited them over to speak to us &amp; the girl with the sign came right over.&#160; The pro lifer had been holding a sign with a picture of a little child that read, below the picture, "Mommy please love me".&#160;&#160; So the first thing that she said was " I wouldn't kill a 5 year old".&#160; Then the pro lifer started to talk to her. The police wanted us to all go away, so the pro lifer &amp; the girl went across the street to talk.&#160; Then one of the guys came over to talk to me.&#160; He asked me some questions &amp; I answered them to the best of my ability.&#160; I then gave him the card with the Focus Pregnancy Help Center's information on it, plus the address to this web site, which I hope &amp; pray that he looks at.&#160; He touched my heart.&#160; The police wanted to go, so we had to go too.&#160; Also, a Truth packet was handed out to 4 of the pro abortion protesters, who happened to park in our parking lot.&#160; I know it was God's grace that they took the packet which had a lot of information in it.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; It was a good experience to engage with the pro abortion people &amp; hopefully, by the grace of God, that their eyes were opened to the Truth today &amp; that they get the help &amp; healing that&#160;God wants&#160;for them,&#160;from what they did in the past. They are not happy people but people who are in great pain.&#160; For God loves us all but hates our sins.&#160; Jesus loves &amp; forgives, just ask Him.&#160; I hope that 'Today was the First Day of the Rest&#160;of Your&#160;Life'!!</font></strong></p><p align="left"><strong><font size="4">Check out R News:</font></strong></p><p align="left"><a href="http://www.rnews.com/Story_2004.cfm?ID=69821&amp;rnews_story_type=18"><strong><font size="4">http://www.rnews.com/Story_2004.cfm?ID=69821&amp;rnews_story_type=18</font></strong></a></p><p align="left"><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><h2 align="left" class="date-header"><a href="http://backpew.blogspot.com/"><font color="#716e6c"><font size="4"><font color="#000000">View from the choir web site</font>&#160;</font></font></a></h2><!-- Begin .post --><p align="left"><strong><font size="4">&#160;</font></strong><a href="http://backpew.blogspot.com/search/label/pro-life"><strong><font size="4">http://backpew.blogspot.com/search/label/pro-life</font></strong></a></p><p align="left" class="post"><font size="4">&#160;</font></p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.bottingnet.com/Images%252045th/APicnic%2520014%2520A%2520table%2520of%2520food.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.bottingnet.com/45th%2520reunion%2520photos.html&amp;h=532&amp;w=640&amp;sz=234&amp;tbnid=xzQmlsLt6PTKuM::&amp;tbnh=114&amp;tbnw=137&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dpictures%2Bof%2Ba%2Btable%2Bof%2Bfood&amp;hl=en&amp;usg=__6n4HWijkkdFynWTZ6BQatb_Xo08=&amp;ei=Lz-sScG6LYTSnQe44IzTDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=image&amp;cd=1"><font size="4"><img width="137" height="114" border="1" align="middle" src="http://www.google.com/images?q=tbn:xzQmlsLt6PTKuM::www.bottingnet.com/Images%25252045th/APicnic%252520014%252520A%252520table%252520of%252520food.jpg" alt="http://www.bottingnet.com/45th%20reunion%20photos.html" title="http://www.bottingnet.com/45th%20reunion%20photos.html" style="width: 139px;

It's been quite interesting.&#160; There seems to be lots of activity there, with young women leaving the building, people going out to lunch, and lunch-time traffic.<br />
I hold the "Pray to End Abortion" sign and wave, and I get lots of waves back, and thumbs-up, and beeps from the Pro-Life people, but I have also gotten the infamous finger, hex sign, and thumbs-down. It's very interesting.<br /><br />
A few weeks ago, one woman was leaving PP with 3 very young (high-school age?) women in her car, and I'm holding the sign and waving a packet that Mary gave me, saying, "take this, it will help you..."&#160; (I know I can't cross the line.) One of the young ones in the back seat&#160; gave me the finger, and the driver opened the passenger window and said, "Are you Christian?" To which I answered, "Yes" (God help me, I hope I never, ever deny Him!) Then she responds, saying, people shouldn't be pushing their beliefs on other people.&#160; I'm not good at quick responses, so I just said, well, most people don't kill their unborn children (or something like that).&#160; It's a waste of breath, though, isn't it.<br /><br />
Another time, two black men walked by on the sidewalk, about 15 minutes apart. One said, "God bless you!"&#160; The other said, "So if I get you knocked-up, you gonna have the baby?"&#160; I didn't realize what he said to me until a second later, so my initial response was "What?"&#160; And he didn't bother to repeat it. (I am in my fifties -- that's probably why what he said didn't click with me at first!)<br /><br />
Last week, a black man driving by stopped and called me a Republican and said that Bush is using us to blah-blah-blah. He also rambled on about how Bush was covertly using black children in slavery or some nonsense.&#160; I listened a bit, then just talked over him and said, so the answer is to kill the unborn children?&#160; He gave up and drove on, so I said, "God bless you! I will pray for you!"<br /><br />
Last Thursday, we seemed to get more positive responses, than negative.&#160; One driver took a picture of Bill as he drove by.<br /><br />/
I think my guardian Angel is there with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><br />
It's funny how the pro-choice people tend to violent responses.&#160; That's why I always smile and wave.&#160; I don't hate the pro-choice people or the people who work there; I just hope that maybe they will think about it again and change their heart.&#160; Whereas, I think the pro-choice people hate the messenger, as well as the message.<br /><br />
Bill told me never to go to PP alone, and so far, I have been blessed with someone (mostly Bill) always being there, and good weather (although one week I was freezing, but was happy to offer it up--at least it wasn't snowing).</font></strong><br /><br /></font></p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4">Monday, March 30th. 2009</font></strong></p><div><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>Dear Friends,</strong></font></div><div><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>&#160;</strong></font></div><div><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>What a Birthday present I received from the Lord today.&#160;

Also, I plan to have someone on the other side that is right in front of Planned Parenthood, this is a better view of the parking lot.&#160; We can still direct people into the Focus center so that they can get free pregnancy tests &amp; baby clothes &amp; referrals &amp; good counseling for a change in their lives.&#160; We still can save lives maybe even more with this new strategy.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; The neighbor across the street looked at me &amp; grinned when he saw that I had seen the change.&#160;He needs so much prayer against the evil that&#160;runs his life. &#160;Maybe we will go on&#160;his side of the street again.&#160; Remember we were there for 2 &amp; a 1/2 years after the Federal Court decision, by Judge Acara back in 1999.&#160; We then won our place to be across the street where we are now on appeal.&#160; Don't try to mess with God for He will win every time.&#160; How desperate they are at Planned Parenthood to murder babies &amp; to&#160;mess up&#160;woman's &amp; girl's&#160;lives, &amp; men's&#160; too.&#160;&#160;I called the policeman who took the report on Wednesday when the PP worker came up &amp; over the curb, with her car, towards Martha &amp; I.&#160; He said that the Sergeant went to speak to PP the following&#160;day. &#160;I don't know what he said but I'm sure that he did a good job.&#160; I also found out that she told the police officer, on Wednesday,&#160;that her car brushed against the curb.&#160; If you can work in a place that murders babies then you can also LIE.&#160; She came up &amp; over the curb at us with her bright blue car.&#160; I have kept her in my prayers &amp; so has Martha for her conversion, salvation &amp; repentance &amp; for a new job.&#160; I have forgiven her for what she did,that is required of me as a Christain.&#160; I hope that she thinks about what she did &amp; why.&#160; Lord please change her heart &amp; mind&#160;&amp; all that are at Planned Parenthood, especially the abortionist Rachel Phelps &amp; Nancy Stanwood &amp;

There were 2 pro lifer &amp; I.&#160; The strategy is to be on all sides of Planned Parenthood if there are enough people.&#160; One or two persons on the one side of the street by the trees &amp; the building side &amp; one or two persons across the street right in front of the driveway.&#160; This is were we were for 2 &amp; a 1/2 years until we won on appeal which brought us over to were we are now, on the side of Planned Parenthood.&#160;Since that planted the trees right in front of where we stand to counsel I thought of another strategy which covers us on all sides of the building.&#160; I was calling out to the girls &amp; a couple got mouthy but what do you expect when there are at Planned Parenthood &amp; probably living an immoral life.&#160; A car drove in with 2 young girls with the driver screaming "I want an abortion, are they doing them today".&#160; How sick!!&#160; Then pulled right out again &amp; stopped the car &amp; the driver was screaming at the other pro lifer about Hell.&#160; I said something to them &amp; the driver told me to "shut up you.....".&#160;I then realized that these were the 2 girls, that another pro lifer had told me about regarding yesterdays&#160;incident.&#160; Apparently the pro lifer, who was with me today, was on the sidewalk yesterday when they had stopped the car &amp; hollered out that she didn't regret her abortion. The pro lifer said to her "how old would your child be right now"&#160; &amp; the other pro lifer said to her "hell is forever".&#160; They came back &amp; saw her again &amp; screamed at her.&#160; As they drove away I said that what they did was "evil".&#160; I hope that we don't see them again only if they want help to get help to recover.&#160;&#160; I got to talk to a young girl walking into Planned Parenthood &amp; gave her a Truth packet &amp; asked her not to let them take it in there.&#160; She said the "they won't".&#160; I told her to be careful &amp; that we were right next door to help her if she need us. She said "okay".&#160; I told her about the list of doctors that we had in the packet.&#160; She was nice &amp; hope &amp; pray that she won't go back to this Killing Mill for anything.&#160; A car dove into PP &amp; looked at our signs &amp; drove right out again &amp; took 2 Truth packets on the way out.&#160; Praise God!!<br /></strong></font></p><p>&#160;<font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>It was now 4:30PM &amp; I was in the center getting ready for the meeting at 6:30 PM.&#160; Martha came in around 5:30PM to help me out when the door bell rang.&#160; There were 4 people coming into the center.&#160; Thank God Martha had just arrived to help me set up for the meeting.&#160; Martha gave the pregnancy test for the client to do &amp; we all went into the center to talk &amp; for them to receive more literature.&#160; They all were very pro life &amp; want to help us out on the street with their presence &amp; prayers.&#160; I hope so.<br /><br />

was heart sick when she found out &amp; told her if she ever gets pregnant again she was not to do that again but to continue her pregnancy.&#160; I went back into the center to get more literature for the grandmother &amp;

How can you not love your own children no matter how they were conceived.&#160; As if we were all conceived in love &amp; that shouldn't make us vulnerable to be killed. &#160;She also said that she had been a rape survivor, which I said that I was sorry to hear.&#160;

We were standing by the trees &amp; a car pulled out slowly.&#160; The guy in the car looked medieval &amp; foreboding.&#160; The girl that was driving the car looked strange too, she had a weird smile on her face.&#160;

hollered at Maria &amp; I.&#160; We didn't see her coming.&#160; She said "why don't you just shut up for you're upsetting the girls in there &amp; making them feel guilty".&#160; I said "that is not a bad thing".&#160; Then she was trying to justify abortion, which you can never do, by saying if the mother can't afford the baby etc.&#160; I just say to them, when they try to make an excuse for killing their babies, then give your baby up for adoption if you can't raise your child.&#160; She said "no".&#160; Then I said " you would rather have your baby's head chopped off then to give your baby up to a loving couple.&#160; She said "yes".&#160; I said&#160; "you don't know what your talking about".&#160; She just screamed foolish things &amp; walked away like someone had just cut her leg off.&#160; That's what abortion does to women.&#160; It leaves them crazed.&#160; She went back into Planned Parenthood &amp; about 15 minutes later her &amp; her girlfriend came out &amp; she was still screaming bad things to Maria, for I had now gone back into the center&#160;for a&#160;short time&#160;&amp; when I came back out again Maria had told me she was still a mess.&#160; I hope that she felt the love &amp; truth from us &amp; will be convicted &amp; repent so she can get some healing real soon.&#160; God forgives, just ask Him with a sincere heart, &amp; He will forgive you.&#160; You have to ask.&#160; </font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr />

Tony's Mass, at the Focus Pregnancy Help Center, on May 27th. &amp; if he could put this information in the bulletin here.&#160; He said that he would give it to his wife.&#160; Thank you Deacon Burke &amp;&#160;God bless you.&#160; During Mass the priests asked if anyone had something to pray for &amp; to speak it out loud.&#160; So I did.&#160; I was in the back of the church so I cupped my hands &amp; said loudly "I pray for the end to abortion".&#160; Then others asked&#160;for prayers for their intentions.&#160; Towards the ending of the Mass, during the sign of peace, which is the time that we greet the people near us, a young man who had a disability came over to me &amp; said "I liked what you prayed for about the ending of abortion".&#160; I said&#160;"thank you, I wish everyone else felt the way you feel about it".&#160; I almost cried, for I was so touched by his&#160;comment,&#160;for this young man could have been aborted.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="3">A strange thing happened after the Procession.&#160;

a sign, which I did.&#160; Then another prayer warrior arrived to pray in front of the Killing Mill.&#160; I finally got to the sidewalk &amp; was just standing there with my head down doing something when I heard some loud guy voices from down the street screaming to me that I should have been aborted.&#160; That wasn't nice you guys, didn't your mother teach you any lessons on how to treat a lady, I&#160;guess not.&#160; I hollered back to them that if&#160;you had anything to do with killing&#160;your kids you need to repent.&#160; I bet you that they had.&#160; You protested to much.&#160; So many people have been involved in having their children killed by abortion.&#160; It'll hit them hard later on.&#160; I set up the signs, on the one side, by the trees that PP had planted to block our vision then I took some signs &amp; the literature container &amp; put it in my car &amp; drove it to the other side of PP's building.&#160; I counseled on that side because it gives me a better view of the people who just drove into the parking lot to speak to them.&#160; No big trees in my way.&#160; I was there &amp; spoke to the girls &amp; guys going into this horrible place.&#160; One of the little boys ran over to me &amp; I gave him a Truth packet &amp; some Rosaries to give to his mother &amp; sister who the mom brought in.&#160; Lord have mercy!&#160; Hopefully this information will speak for itself.&#160; We gave away many packets on both sides of the sidewalk this afternoon.&#160;Thank God.&#160;&#160;Then another prayer warrior came&#160;onto the sidewalk to pray.&#160; He was there for about&#160;20 minutes when Cleveland, our street person &amp; friend,&#160;came walking down the street with his worn out shoes that Martha bought&#160;him&#160;only a couple of months ago.&#160; He walks a lot during the day &amp; he wore out his new shoes.&#160; Ken, our new prayer warrior,&#160;was nice enough to have bought Cleveland some new white sneakers to wear.&#160; They fit &amp; Cleveland was&#160;very happy with his new shoes.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;<img width="125" height="93" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/3368675635.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p></div><p><strong><font size="3">Then the Hell began.&#160; A young man with a cigarette came over to me onto sidewalk saying that he a question for me.&#160; I knew what he was going to say &amp; I was right.&#160; "What if the girl is 14 &amp; was raped by a older man &amp; she is pregnant".&#160; I said that the baby should not die for the crime of the father &amp; that rape is something that she can heal from but if she has an abortion that will stay with her the rest of her life.&#160; There is adoption &amp; love &amp; support in the community.&#160; The adult will be held more accountable then the 14 year&#160;old girl.&#160; I said "are you going to be there when she is crying at 3 in the morning &amp; if she attempts to take her life &amp; if she goes into a deep depression"?&#160; He couldn't answer me.&#160; I said "no real doctor would ever do abortions".&#160; Then he said that he was a Doctor, then he said a Medical Student.&#160; I said you are sure starting off wrong &amp; won't go anywhere if you believe in killing children.&#160; I told him that I was a gang rape survivor with a pregnancy, from the rape,&#160;that ended&#160;in a miscarriage.&#160; That doesn't matter because they look at it as 'you don't have the kid'.&#160; How sick &amp; sad this society has become.&#160; A throw away society we live in.&#160; I grieve my pregnancy loss &amp; I wasn't responsible for&#160;my twins death, imagine if I was.&#160; I mentioned Adoption, which again means having the baby.&#160; They want the baby dead &amp; that's that!&#160; I said that Planned Parenthood doesn't report statutory rape.&#160; That doesn't matter to these people either.&#160; They want the baby dead!&#160; I told him that she would probably hate him someday for taking her here, to have her baby be murdered &amp; that he was also responsible for this baby's death.&#160; I told him that I named this precious baby, that he allowed to be killed&#160;here at Planned Parenthood,&#160;Rebecca.&#160; Lord have mercy on his soul.&#160; I hope that he will quite Medical School, we already have to many doctors that kill&#160;&amp; not heal.&#160; I don't call them doctors, I call them abortionists, because doctors don't kill their patients children but abortionists do.&#160; Their lives will never be the same again.&#160; </font></strong></p><p align="left"><strong><font size="3">A car drove up to the curb &amp;

Here, &amp; I pointed to Planned Parenthood, is where the children ARE being aborted".&#160; He went nuts.&#160; He was screaming like someone just cut his leg off.&#160; The pain for him was that great.&#160;

she couldn't have anymore children after that.&#160; I said "did she ask God to forgive her"?&#160; He said "yes".&#160; I mentioned Project Rachel &amp; Rachel's Vineyard &amp; he said that she's worked it through the church.&#160;

put her hands to her face &amp; started to cry.&#160; I said to her friend, who was now holding her "did she have an abortion"?&#160; The girlfriend said "no".&#160; I said "thank God, a girl with a heart".&#160; I said to her that I usually don't see this reaction&#160;when seeing the picture of the aborted baby &amp; that she had touched my heart with her caring in what this poor baby went through.&#160; She is 'special'.&#160; I told her that I wish everyone reacted this way.&#160; God bless you dear heart.&#160; As the cars were driving by on the street I said to them that "Planned Parenthood was killing Americans in there" or that "PP was murdering babies in there".&#160; People need to know about the horrors of Planned Parenthood evil agenda.&#160; A girl was driving out &amp; said "you don't need to make them feel bad in there"&#160; I said "just think know bad the babies feel as they are being ripped apart by abortion".&#160;

Bill is across the street &amp; peacefully protests the evils of Planned Parenthood with her.&#160; I looked up the sidewalk to see Winnie &amp; Mike, her husband &amp; another person.&#160; I walked up the sidewalk to greet the newcomers only to be introduced to a Priest, Fr. Jacob, from Africa, was there blessing us with his presence &amp; prayers.&#160; I was so happy to have such prayer power on the sidewalk in front of the Killing Mill.&#160; I went back to the center to get the signs to put up.&#160; David now showed up to pray,&#160;he&#160; also helped me set up the signs. It was windy &amp; raining now.&#160; I got some umbrellas&#160;to give out to the prayer warriors, so they wouldn't get to wet.&#160; Our counselor,&#160;at the pregnancy center,&#160;now arrived, so I let her in &amp; spoke with her for a few minutes.&#160;&#160;&#160;I went back to the sidewalk &amp; stood there with a sign.&#160; A few minutes later a young girl walked up the sidewalk.&#160; She said "hello everyone", with a smile on her face.&#160; I said to her "how many babies are you going to help kill today"?&#160; For I thought that she was the Death Escort Melissa, the young woman who held the sign against her chest 'I don't Regret My Abortion' at our Pro Life March &amp; since that day has been a Death Escort at PP on Thursdays.&#160; Well the young woman, who I just spoke with said "Oh, with a startled look on her face,&#160;I've taken your packets before" &amp; continued walking up the sidewalk passed the entrance of PP.&#160; Oh no!!&#160; I got the wrong person &amp; have insulted a nice lady that we have spoken to at one time.&#160; I felt so badly, so I decided to catch up to her to apologize to her.&#160; I walked&#160;up the street&#160;&amp; hollered to her to "please stop" I want to talk to you, but she didn't stop.&#160; I thought either she didn't hear me or she was upset with me.&#160; I walked as fast as I could with all my physical problems I have.&#160; I finally caught up with her around Scio St. &amp; she turned around to me,&#160;thank God.&#160; I said to her right away "I'm so sorry, I thought that you were the Escort at Planned Parenthood, you look so much like her minus the face jewelry, which I thought that she took out.&#160; "Please forgive me" I said.&#160; She said "oh yea, no problem"&#160; I said that I see so much evil &amp; I hope that it doesn't mar my perception.&#160; She seemed to understand.&#160; Then she said "I gave the packet, that I received to my sister &amp; she called me saying that she had read all the brochures &amp; was amazed by all the things that she didn't know before.&#160; I was so pleased to hear this &amp; said to her "when you pass by again on the sidewalk I'll bring you into the center to receive more information to give to your sister, we have different pamphlets&#160;in there.&#160; She said "that would be great, maybe next week".&#160; I told her that I would be out there on Tuesday afternoon.&#160; Then she said that&#160;her friend at age&#160;17 got pregnant &amp; wanted the baby but her boyfriend &amp; his family surrounded her &amp; forced her to have an abortion.&#160; She was a Born again Christian.&#160; She is now suffering with what she did to the Lord &amp; her baby.&#160; I mentioned Project Rachel to her to give to her friend.&#160; This young girl I was talking to had the most beautiful colored ocean green eyes &amp; her name is Courtney.&#160; I said again "thank you for forgiving me &amp; I'll keep you &amp; your friend in my prayers &amp; I hope to see you again soon".&#160; As we were still talking the rain picked up &amp; I got soaked from my wait down to my feet because the wind was blowing towards me.&#160;&#160;Just then a car beeped at me,&#160;it was Martha riding&#160;down the street towards Planned Parenthood, to counsel.&#160; I&#160;waved back&#160;to her.&#160; I said good bye to Courtney&#160;&amp; I went to go back to the prayer team.&#160; I was soaked &amp; I remembered that I had brought an extra blouse &amp; socks but no extra pants, what was I thinking of!&#160; I got to the&#160;center &amp; used the blow dryer, to try to dry&#160;my pants, but they were to&#160;soaked.&#160; I new that Martha, who counsels &amp; the prayer people were out there to witness to the girls, so I was at peace to know that they were trying to save the babies from being aborted, while I was in the center drying my pants because I was to stupid to bring an extra pairwith me.&#160; It could rain in Rochester at any time always be prepared!!&#160; I will next time.&#160; I went back outside with wet pants &amp; then Martha came over to me &amp; said "would you like to wear these &amp; handed me a pair of black pants".&#160; I said "I sure would" &amp; asked her where she got them.&#160; She said that she had an extra pair in the car.&#160; Thank you Lord for you do provide.&#160; I went back into the center to put the dry pants on &amp;

She reached into the literature box &amp;&#160;got herself a Truth packet which was fine with me&#160;&amp; then preceded to tell me that she has 4 children &amp; had her tubes tied or at least she thinks so.&#160;They might have been cut.&#160; She said that her mother, who&#160;was Protestant, didn't believe in&#160;abortion &amp; taught her well, it was her that rebelled.&#160; I said that tying one's tubes was a sin &amp; it needed the forgiveness from God, who is all&#160;forgiving &amp; merciful.&#160; I said for her to call the doctor that did the surgery &amp; find out what he did to her, for she said that she wanted&#160; a reversal.&#160; It sounded that the Lord was working on her right now.&#160; I said that sex was reserved for marriage &amp; for her to pray for God's grace in this matter.&#160; I said that when we die we will either go to Heaven or to Hell.&#160; She was taught, by her good mom, this truth.&#160; She walked with the man with the tattoos up the street.&#160; I'm hopeful of this young woman.&#160; </font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">Martha went over to the side right next to the PP building with the mega phone &amp;

She hurried out the driveway.&#160; What would compel a woman or a man to kill someone's little baby, in the womb?&#160; How Evil is that!! </font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">Martha has now moved to the PP side &amp;

were instructed by Martha.&#160; I was standing now across the street &amp; when the president of Planned Parenthood, James Stewart came out, he's looking a little grayer, I said to&#160;him "repent, old man,&#160;for the evil that you are doing here in killing God's children".&#160; Lord have mercy on judgment day for these people.&#160; I hope that they repent first.&#160; I'm even scared of meeting the Lord, with all my sins of not loving the best that I should have daily, which offends Him so much.&#160; I will say to Him "Lord have mercy on me a miserable sinner".&#160; He will for He is&#160;merciful.&#160; </font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><p align="left"><strong><font size="3">I got to talk to a young girl who was nasty.&#160; I told her that I was speaking 'tough love' to her.&#160; She came out with a band aid on her arm, which was a Depo shot, which acts at times, as an early abortion, which is taking a life.&#160; It also thins the bones causing brittle bones &amp; possible fractures &amp; it messes up the reproductive organs &amp; system.&#160; Nothing good in this 'death shot'.&#160; She was mad at me&#160;but at least she knew that I cared.&#160; Pray the that&#160;she will wake up, along with others, who are deceived by Planned Parenthood.&#160;

He said "what purpose do you have here"&#160;? &#160;I felt like a knife in my&#160;back.&#160; I said "the purpose is to save lives".&#160; He hollered "Oh no you don't, I'm&#160;pro choice".&#160; I&#160;replied "then I feel sorry for your son, poor kid".&#160;

growth &amp; development of the baby, in the womb.&#160; It sounded like it was the same woman that I spoke with yesterday with the man who had&#160;the tattoos.&#160; Carol said that the man with her had&#160;bazaar tattoos, which sounded like him.&#160; I was glad that she had given her the DVD.&#160; I then gave Carol another DVD for the next person who will come her way who will need it.&#160; Carol is so cool, she waves to the cars passing her by, on the street &amp; the cars coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She is so friendly that you want to approach her to talk to her.&#160; Another personal approach to the ministry.&#160; After Carol left I let Maria into the center for she was nice enough to take over the counseling duties for Suzanne who went to visit her family in Florida.&#160; I was so happy to have someone in the center &amp; Maria knows how to counsel for she was our first counselor a couple years ago.&#160;&#160;She has started 'Saif House' for mothers in need.&#160; I spoke with her for a short time &amp; went back to the sidewalk with signs &amp; the mega phone &amp; literature packets.&#160; Just then a woman turned the corner onto the sidewalk where I was standing,&#160;from the PP parking lot.&#160; &#160;She said to me "you remember me don't you".&#160; I said "yes".&#160; Then she said that she needed some things in the center &amp; I walked with her to the center to see Maria.&#160; She then said to me "my mother still works at Planned Parenthood but she is trying to get another job".&#160; "Sure" I said.&#160; Some people just like to stay in their rut.&#160; Change scares some people, maybe working in a killing mill doesn't scare her enough.&#160; I'm growing more cynical with time.&#160;Maria remembered this young lady &amp; I left to go back to the sidewalk again.&#160; There was Bill Smith&#160;&amp; I &amp; was waiting for more people to arrive, which they all came later.&#160; Paul came with a chicken sandwich &amp; an ice tea from Wendy's for me.&#160; Thanks Paul for being so thoughtful.&#160; David&#160;had come now to pray with Paul.&#160; I spotted 3 young girls with a baby in a stroller coming down the street towards Planned Parenthood &amp; I went to them to offer them some help.&#160; I brought them to the center for baby clothes &amp; a pregnancy test.&#160; The one girl was already pregnant &amp; she need some literature &amp; support.&#160; Maria was still talking to the young lady that I brought in&#160;a little while&#160;ago &amp; she left saying that she was going to come back to get her things for she had to go to court.&#160; I said "okay, I'll be here until about 7PM tonight &amp; I'll see you later".&#160; Then Maria was busy with our 3 clients &amp; the baby in the stroller.&#160; Just then Martha showed up &amp; I asked her if she would assist Maria with the 3 clients &amp; the cute baby in the stroller.&#160; She said that she would, so back to the sidewalk I go.&#160; I spoke with some girls &amp; gave away some Truth packets to those who wanted them.&#160; Paul &amp; David are pro active when it comes to offering the packets to the people.&#160; Great team work.&#160; Martha came back to the sidewalk &amp; then I went back into the center for another sign.&#160; I popped my head into the center to see how Maria was doing.&#160; The little baby was given some baby clothes &amp; a pregnancy test was administered by the client &amp; some literature was given to the pregnant girl.&#160; They all left &amp; went&#160;back to their home &amp; not to Planned Parenthood.&#160; For they were given the Truth &amp; no baby was scheduled to be killed at our center.&#160; I answered some questions for Maria &amp; she finished the paper work &amp; to the sidewalk I went.&#160; Debbie &amp; Jerry &amp; Charles &amp; Bill were now there praying &amp; witnessing.&#160; Charles brought me a banana &amp; a desert from McDonnell's.&#160; I get well fed by my friends.&#160; Martha was on the brick side of Planned Parenthood with mega phone speaking the Truth to the people going into the Killing Mill.&#160; I stood by the side where all the new trees were planted to block our vision.&#160; Just then a car pulled into the parking lot with a mother &amp; daughter.&#160; I spoke to them pleading to them not to have their baby killed.&#160; No reaction by them.&#160; I felt sick knowing, in my heart, that they were here to have their baby killed.&#160; It's so evil this place.&#160; Martha was speaking pretty much non stop with the mega phone to inform the people that we can help them.&#160; she was tired so she came back to the side where I was standing then out of no where a angry woman came over to us &amp; started screaming "you're going to hell, you're going to hell".&#160; "you're judging &amp; making these girls feel guilty".&#160; I said "if you're doing something wrong then you should feel guilty &amp; that killing is worse then judging &amp; that we weren't judging anyone's souls but their actions. "You should&#160; judge wisely".&#160; "How you judge is how you will be judged".&#160; She just went on to scream some more.&#160; Then she said "who's going to take care of the baby" then Martha said "I will".&#160; She just screamed some more ranting &amp; raving.&#160; Paul came up to her with the picture of the aborted baby &amp; said that "this is abortion &amp; my sister had one &amp; her life has never been the same since".&#160; Then she said "where's your sister now"?&#160; Paul replied "at work".&#160; Why did she want to know? &#160;She&#160;just went on &amp; on then went back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I turned around &amp; there was a client that said that she was coming to talk to me, at the center.&#160; Maria had gone earlier, so we walked into the center to talk.&#160; We talked for awhile &amp; then she took some baby clothes for her 2 year old, she's expecting her 4th. baby in July.&#160; We said good bye &amp; then I went back to the sidewalk.&#160; When I arrived back to where the team was, Martha told me that the screaming woman came back &amp; took a packet &amp; threw it down the sewer.&#160; How nice of her.&#160; She also bumped into Martha saying that Martha bumped into her &amp; that she was going to call the police.&#160; Debbie was a witness of this 'set up'&#160;for some reason the 2 guys didn't see it happening.&#160; I said if she comes back we shouldn't talk to her for she&#160;was dangerous &amp; guilty of sin.&#160;She also blew cigarette smoke in Martha's face &amp; threw a cigarette butt at me. &#160;Nice lady. Then Debbie had to leave &amp; she was going to her car when a police car drove passed us &amp; waved at us.&#160; The car stopped down the street &amp; parked there.&#160; I went up to Debbie &amp; asked her if she could wait for a few minutes &amp; she said "yes".&#160; Just then the police car drove away.&#160; I said "she didn't call the police &amp; thanks Debbie for staying".&#160; Off she went.&#160; Then Martha left too.&#160; Martha had told her earlier&#160;that if she did call the police that she was going to tell them that she blocked the sewer with paper.&#160; Good thinking Martha.&#160; She didn't come back to the sidewalk again&#160;but when she left, with the young girl in the car, she left the parking still screaming.&#160; Lord have mercy on her soul if she took part in having a baby killed here today.&#160; She sure acted as if she had.&#160; </font></strong></p><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">The guys stayed with me for awhile to pray then Bill had to leave.&#160; It was Paul &amp; I now, it was about 5:30PM.&#160; I looked up the street &amp; saw 2 women standing on the sidewalk smoking.&#160;&#160;The one woman told me to put the sign down I was holding &amp; I said "no".&#160;The&#160;other girl said something to me that I can't print on this web site.&#160; I said "I love you".&#160; I was just asking if they wanted&#160;a Truth packet &amp; they got nasty.&#160;&#160;They finally left but again the other woman said some colorful words again&#160;to which I replied " I had already said that I loved you".&#160; Please Lord help me to love&#160;the people that insult me.&#160; They both left only to come out of PP with&#160;a young girl.&#160; Here we go again, another mother daughter scenario.&#160; I said "she will hate you someday for&#160;bringing her here, I only hope that she will forgive you".&#160;&#160;&#160;Then a few minutes I saw the mother- daughter that I had spoken to about 21/2 hours earlier come out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; There were 3 mother- daughter killing of their grandchildren today.&#160; They all will regret this someday, I only hope &amp; pray.&#160; What a&#160;family mess!!!&#160;</font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><font size="3">Paul &amp;

then she left.&#160; Dan came around 8PM to drop off some things &amp; had to leave to see his grandchildren.&#160; Paul &amp; I stayed until about 8:30PM.&#160; I thank God for his help tonight &amp;

I was right in front of Planned Parenthood &amp; I came against a very evil man &amp; his wife &amp; one of his daughters, for I think that the other daughter was in there for an abortion.&#160; The husband turned his radio up real loud in the parking lot &amp; then I spoke to him &amp; he was bad from the beginning.&#160; Then his wife came out &amp; said for me to go to hell &amp; to shut up.&#160; I told her that we could help her &amp; wanted to help her &amp; that I am trying to avoid going to hell by God's mercy.&#160; Then as they were walking towards the back parking lot the man took down his pants &amp; mooned me.&#160; I told him that I was going to call the police, which I did.&#160; Two police cam one in a car &amp; the other officer, on a bike.&#160; I told them what had happened &amp; they went into PP &amp; talked to the man.&#160; He said that he just pulled on his belt &amp; that was all.&#160; I told the police that he was lying.&#160; Planned Parenthood was protecting him saying that he wasn't on the camera view, which he was they just didn't want the police to see it.&#160; He said that he admonished him.&#160;I said that he was here for his daughter's abortion &amp; the police said that there were 2 sides to this issue.&#160; I said that abortion was murder &amp; he looked down to the ground.&#160; Yes officer, if that's how you deal with this crime then I feel sorry for you.&#160; He was a nice officer but a bit confused, like most people.&#160; I said that the guy was staring at me by the door&#160;&amp; that I was a rape survivor &amp; that I didn't like that.&#160; The guy gave me the creeps.&#160; He said that he couldn't stop him from staring at me but if I needed him again that he would come back.&#160;

He said to me "can I ask you a couple of questions"?&#160; I said "yes".&#160; He started to say that I was judging &amp; the Bibles says not to.&#160; I said that the Bible says to 'judge wisely' &amp; 'the way we judge is the way we will be judged'.&#160; I said that we are out here to help the girls &amp; guys with the Truth.&#160; I gave him a scenario about judging &amp; he turned right around.&#160; I guess if it meant me not doing anything to protect him it was a different story.&#160; I said if someone comes up to you &amp; wants to do you bodily harm &amp; I say "well I'm not going to judge your motives in harming this man".&#160; Or would you want me to help save your life from this intruder'?&#160; He choose the latter.&#160; Just then I heard a voice from behind me &amp; looked over.&#160; There was a young girl with short shorts on barefoot with a large sore on her upper leg.&#160;

She was happy &amp; her son was so cute &amp; I gave him some books &amp; a toy to take home.&#160; He said "thank you".&#160;&#160;He touched my heart.&#160; Being childless is so painful.&#160; My miscarried twins, form the gang rape, are in Heaven &amp;

She was educated by both Suzanne &amp; I about the abortive effects of&#160; Birth Control.&#160; She said that she would tell her sister plus she now had literature that would help her to explain.&#160; I noticed that, at one time that her sister was talking to the Escorts &amp; I said to her not to listen to them but to listen to her sister.&#160; As they were leaving the parking lot they waved good-bye to me.&#160;

A Truth packet was handed out to 2 girls, in a car, that wanted it.&#160; Great!&#160; Marie had to leave after the Rosary &amp; I decided to stay a little while longer to witness.&#160; I offered a Truth packet to a young girl walking&#160;up the street towards Planned Parenthood&#160;but she refused the information &amp; went into the building.&#160; How sad.&#160; As I was about to leave two young girls walked out of the parking lot towards me.&#160; I spoke with them for a few minutes &amp; offered them a Truth packet &amp; they took it.&#160; I asked if they would like to come to the center &amp; receive more information &amp; they said "yes".&#160; As we were leaving, a Planned Parenthood worker hollered out her window for the girls to "keep on going".&#160; They don't want the Truth to get out!&#160; They claim to be 'pro choice' but they don't want you to hear the side for 'life' at all, only the side of 'death', abortion &amp; birth control.&#160; Well,&#160;the girls didn't listen to her &amp; off we went to the center to talk in a pleasant atmosphere.&#160; We went in &amp; I showed them the center &amp; the new baby clothes room.&#160; We spoke &amp; I found out that they both had abortions at Planned Parenthood less then a year ago.&#160; They didn't know what they did &amp; was receptive to get help with Post Abortion Counseling.&#160;&#160;I asked what their parents said about their pregnancies?&#160; On of the girls, who was 15 at the time of her pregnancy said that she mother told her that it was "up to you".&#160; &#160;How horrible &amp; irresponsible.&#160; The other girl who is 17&#160;said that her mother told her to "get an abortion" which she unfortunately did.&#160; She said that her sister got pregnant &amp; refused an abortion &amp; her mother kicked her out of the house.&#160; She had her baby &amp; she showed me a picture of her nephew.&#160; What a cute!&#160; I gave her some little boy clothes to give to her sister &amp; a "thank you for choosing life" from me to her.&#160; God bless her.&#160;I spoke to the girls for them to ask&#160;Jesus to forgive them for their abortions&#160;for they were Christians.&#160;They left with so much information &amp; their eyes opened to the Truth for a New Beginning.</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="3">&#160;</font></strong></div><div><p><strong><font size="3">As I was leaving the building I saw Mac, from&#160; the store next door &amp; engaged in a conversation with him.&#160; He said that he was very sick at one time &amp; died.&#160; He said that the "other side" was so beautiful &amp; he didn't want to come back to earth.&#160; The Lord sent him back &amp; I'm glad that He did for he is a blessing to me &amp; to others.&#160; He is a Christian that believes in Christ&#160;&amp; acts&#160;like Christ.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">As I was saying good bye to him a car came into the parking lot &amp;

was feeling lead to go back to see if she was coming into the center.&#160; As I turned around &amp; returned to the center she was just getting off the phone &amp; coming out of the car.&#160; She turned to me &amp; asked if we did pap smears &amp; pregnancy tests.&#160; I said that we do pregnancy tests but no pap smears.&#160; She said okay then I'll go to Planned Parenthood, thank you.&#160; I then said to her "Planned Parenthood kills babies &amp; deceives young girls" just thinking about the 2 clients that I just spoke with.&#160; "Well" she said "it's important to&#160;offer pap smears&#160;for cervical cancer testing".&#160; "Yes" I said "let the girls go to real doctors that don't kill babies for their testing not Planned Parenthood".&#160; "I'm Catholic" she said &amp; I said that I was a Catholic also.&#160; "Stay close to God" I said&#160;&amp; she just looked a me funny.&#160; She was a bit nervous at this time &amp; really wanted to go.&#160; As she was getting into her car I offered her our brochure which she said "no thank you" &amp; off she went into the parking lot of Planned Parenthood.&#160; The Lord brought me back to plant a seed of Truth in her.&#160;

souls &amp; to witness Truth to the people.&#160; The first angry girl came out with her bird finger up in the air.&#160; Post abortive probably, wish that she would have stopped to start to&#160;receive the healing &amp; forgiveness that she so desperately needs.&#160; They just stay so wounded &amp;&#160;miserable.&#160; Mary gave a Truth packet to a mother &amp; daughter &amp; they accepted it graciously.&#160;&#160;Mary then said to me they she saw&#160;a piece of paper that showed an&#160;ultrasound picture.&#160;

puts up inside her cervix.&#160; The 'Killing Pills' are used widely by Planned Parenthood to end a pregnancy.&#160; Planned Parenthood hands her the destructive pills &amp; then the mother&#160;becomes &#160;pro active &amp; is directly the person that kills her baby.&#160; She takes the first pill, that takes the life of her baby, then she puts the other 2 pills up inside herself that is used to expel the dead baby.&#160;

witnessing &amp; counseling.&#160; So it would be Martha or I in the center when needed.&#160; David came by to give me my usual Wendy's hamburger, I'm sure going to miss him when he leaves to go to Buffalo to work.&#160; I'm so spoiled.&#160; So he got out of his car to set up the signs &amp; started to pray.&#160; It rained but that's what we're used&#160;so we&#160;just get out the umbrellas.&#160; I decided to go to the other side&#160;of Planned Parenthood by the brick front &amp; Martha joined me a few minutes later with a Truth packet, in her hands.&#160; A few minutes later a young girl came walking down the sidewalk.&#160; I said to her that "Planned Parenthood kills babies".&#160;

have some food &amp; conversation before I put Jerry to work.&#160; We have a delightful time sharing such interesting conversation.&#160; I brought out the cookies &amp; mixed nuts &amp; the boys had a good time indulging in both.&#160; It did my heart good.&#160; After we ate Jerry brought into the center the desk that Bernie, the Landlord gave me.&#160; Looks great in the center room.&#160; After that I asked Jerry to paint the water stains on the ceiling in the meeting room, which he did.&#160;

we talked to a young man who said that he was going in for condoms.&#160; I said "no" sex outside of marriage".&#160; He said that he was married but his wife left him after 5 years of marriage.&#160;How sad. &#160;He took a Truth packet &amp; I told that he needed to pray &amp; be chaste, for &#160; Heaven will be his reward.&#160; He made some notion that Heaven was having sex but I told him that there were no organisms in Hell &amp; that most people end up there because of the sins of the flesh.&#160; "Stay close to God, he will bless you".&#160; He went into Planned Parenthood, probably to get those condoms&#160;but when he came out he hung around us on the sidewalk for a little while.&#160; Maybe he felt more comfortable with us because we cared about him &amp; his soul.&#160; </font></strong></div><div>&#160;</div><div><strong><font size="4" color="#003300">Susan just arrived &amp; started to pray the Rosary.&#160; Francis came by &amp; he went to witness in front of Planned Parenthood.&#160;

showed him the picture of the aborted baby.&#160; He didn't realize that was what abortion looked like.&#160; Mary also gave a Truth packet to 2 girls that walked over to her &amp; then went into Planned Parenthood.&#160;

she told me that she was trying to talk her out of it &amp; it looks like that it worked because she didn't show up.&#160; I asked if she need any help from us at the center &amp; that we give out baby clothes.&#160; She said that she did need some clothes for her 2 children so I brought her into the center our new 'Material Aid' room.&#160; She was delighted to see that we had older clothes for her children were older.&#160; She was blessed with many nice things for her son &amp; daughter.&#160; She said that she would bring her friend in to get baby clothes &amp; I said that would be fine.&#160;&#160;I also&#160;gave her much literature to educate her so that she could continue to help her friend to 'choose life' for her little baby.&#160;

They stopped to talk to me&#160;&amp; I asked them if they would like to come to&#160;the Focus Center to see it.&#160; The one girl said that I should come to her school on Clinton &amp; Andrews, that it was a private school but I should talk to the girls there. They said that they were going up the street&#160;for lunch &amp; that they would stop on the way back.&#160; I said okay &amp; then I would be set up &amp; I could give them a Truth packet filled with vital information.&#160; They waved good bye &amp; off they went. &#160;I went into the center &amp; did a couple of things then&#160;headed out to the frontlines.&#160; Mary S. came a few minutes later.&#160; She showed me a picture of an aborted baby killed by a&#160;Saline Injection abortion.&#160; The baby was burned to death.&#160; Thanks Mom.&#160; If you didn't want me you didn't have to kill me, you just had to give me up to someone else who wanted me.&#160; Poor baby.&#160; We talked for awhile then we decided to print up some very graphic 1st. trimester abortions &amp; put the pictures in a binder to show the people on the sidewalk the Truth about what abortion looks like.&#160; A picture speaks a thousand words.&#160; Mary S. agreed to take the pictures from my web site Rochesterprolife.org to print out, for educational purposes.&#160; I told Mary S. about the three young girls earlier on &amp; was excited to speak to them when they returned after their lunch.&#160; I had to run into the center to do something &amp; when I came out Mary S, had said that the three girls came by &amp; took a Truth packet &amp; looked at the graphic sign that she was holding.&#160; They looked a bit shocked.&#160; I was upset to see hear that I missed them but Mary S. did a great job.&#160; We witnessed together &amp; then she had to go back to work.&#160; Just then a car stopped along side of me &amp; it was David &amp; he was handing me a Wendy's hamburger, oh David I will miss you so when you move to Buffalo, not just for the hamburgers but because you are such a nice guy.&#160; He parked his car &amp; helped to set up the signs &amp; then Charles &amp; Jerry came to help to.&#160; The team was there.&#160; Martha wasn't there because her daughter-in -law was having a baby girl named Melissa.&#160;

That I would be looking forward to seeing her there.&#160; She smiled &amp; maybe that is when she new that I really cared about her.&#160; I felt good about this encounter.&#160; It started to rain so I went into the center to spend some time talking with Suzanne about some things.&#160; After she left Janet, Elaine &amp; Dan came by.&#160;&#160;We had a meeting &amp; shared many interesting&#160;pro life events in our life.&#160; Dan said that&#160;a couple, that were being witnessed to by a&#160;side walk counselor, saw an angel &amp; changed their minds to abort their child.&#160;&#160;The couple later&#160;married &amp; had their baby girl.&#160; Praise God!!!&#160; &#160;It was a blessed evening.&#160; </font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4" color="#ffffff" style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 255);">&#160;Martha's son &amp;

she helped me to bring the signs to the sidewalk. As we were walking to the sidewalk a young girl was walking towards Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said to her that we had information for her if she was planning to go to Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that she was going for an IUD &amp; I said that it could cause an early abortion &amp; has side effects &amp; is that what God would want you to do?&#160; We starting talking some more &amp; I found out that she was going in that evil place to meet her family member who was in there.&#160; I asked if she was there for an abortion &amp; she said "yes, I think so".&#160; I gave her the Truth packet &amp; the Growth &amp; Development guide of the baby in the womb&#160;&amp; asked her to go in there to save this baby from being killed.&#160; She took the packet &amp; went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; We were hoping &amp; praying that she would come out soon to tell us that the baby &amp; mother were fine &amp; no killing took place but I never saw the girl again. Mary S. &amp; I set up the signs &amp; we were talking about making a binder of very graphic aborted baby pictures of the 1st. trimester, to show the girls &amp; guys out on the sidewalk, for educational purposes, about what abortion looks like.&#160; They do see the graphic signs but sometimes they need more to persuade them to do the right thing.&#160; Just then a young guy came around the trees &amp; started to talk to us.&#160; We came to find out that he had his sister in there having her baby killed by Planned Parenthood.&#160; I said to him to go back inside there to talk her out of it but he said that it was to late, that she was in the 'Back Room', which means 'The Killing Room'.&#160; I said "how sad that you were a part of this murder of this innocent baby, you should have not come here to give her support.&#160; He said that she drove herself in &amp; he &amp; his mother &amp; his sisters children came to pick her up.&#160; Again I said that none of you should be apart of this killing &amp; you will suffer someday by being here to help her after she had her baby killed. He said that he was gay but wanted to adopt someday.&#160; I said "I hope that you're not practicing your gayness, for that is a sin".&#160; He said "no, I'm not".&#160; I then said to him that maybe you should have adopted your niece or nephew instead of your sister killing the baby.&#160; He never thought of that, what a shame.&#160; I gave him a Truth packet &amp; a DVD, hoping &amp; praying that his sister or anyone else in his family would ever do this again.&#160; He left only to come back a few minutes later asking for a packet for his mother.&#160; I gave him one to give to her but I was sick to my stomach that this family was supporting her in having an abortion.&#160; Ick!!&#160; He left &amp; about 20 minutes later he pulled out of Planned Parenthood with his mother on the passenger side &amp; the 3 children in the back seat.&#160; The daughter/sister was not in the car.&#160; As they were diving out, I said to the mother of the daughter in Planned Parenthood, that just had her baby killed by abortion, that they, meaning the brother &amp; her should not have been involved in this abortion at all.&#160; The woman said that God forgives.&#160; I said "don't presume that, if you are not totally sorry for the sin &amp; remember the </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">Commandment of God that says "Thou Shall Not Kill".</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4" color="#000000"><img width="118" height="75" src="/Portals/0/aborted_pics/Suctionabortion10weeks_sm.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">I then asked her if she tried to stop her daughter from doing this &amp; she said "no" "it was her decision &amp; she already has a child".&#160; I nearly flipped out.

How confused they were in thinking that it was all right to have one of God's creations killed because 'she already has a child &amp; it was her decision'.&#160; How lame.&#160;It takes a while to absorb such evil &amp; to know that a baby was killed, not to far from where you are standing &amp; that there was really nothing that you could do to have&#160;saved this precious child, that this family did not want included as a member.&#160; Not enough room in this family for you, dear heart.&#160; I am so sorry for your death.&#160; Lord have mercy on them.&#160; Their hell just begun.&#160; I'll name you 'Pat' &amp; you can be apart of my family.&#160; Love you dear sweet baby!!!!!</font></strong></p></div><p>&#160;<strong><font size="4" color="#000000">&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><img width="104" height="145" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/147949737.jpg" alt="" /></p><div align="left"><p><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">Mary S. had to go back to work &amp; I was by myself.&#160; Just then a young girl was walking up the sidewalk &amp; I said if you are going into Planned Parenthood I'll help you.&#160; She stopped &amp; said to me "No matter what you say it won't make any difference I'm still going to do it, I'm 22 with a baby &amp; have no education or job".&#160; I said you have a necklace of the Blessed Mother around your neck &amp; you're holding onto to it, she will help you, for she is the Mother of God.&#160; Don't look at your situation as the world looks at it, look at it as God looks at it &amp; He will help you".&#160; Off she goes into Planned Parenthood &amp; my heart sank.&#160; Why do mothers want to kill their children??&#160;No matter what your situation is it can change &amp; it never gives you permission to have your baby killed.&#160; The good news is that about 2 hours later she came walking out of Planned Parenthood &amp; was crossing the street.&#160; I said to her "I pray that you didn't do it".&#160; She said shocked her head no but I asked her again to make sure &amp; she said "no I didn't do it".&#160; I was so relieved &amp; happy.&#160; I hollered to her that we had a pregnancy center in the strip mall &amp; that if she need anything please come &amp; let us help you.&#160; She said "yes" &amp; she then turned the corner onto Gibbs St..&#160; Praise God!!!!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">I&#160;was by myself for about an half hour, trusting that the Good Lord would send someone to be with me.&#160; He did &amp; it was Martha.&#160; Thank you Lord.&#160; She went to the side that was closest to Planned Parenthood &amp; she talked her heart out.&#160; She gave two pregnancy tests &amp; gave out some baby clothes too.&#160; She is terrific!!</font></strong></p></div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="5" color="#ff0000">Warning:Graphic Picture below</font></strong></p><div><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Wednesday, July 1, 2009 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></div><div><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">&#160;</font></strong></div><p align="center"><img width="125" height="160" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/2ndtrimetersmall.jpg" alt="" style="width: 125px; height: 132px;" /></p><div><p><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">I told Martha that I was going to be at the center at 3:15 PM but I was 15 minutes late, she was there waiting for me.&#160; Sorry Martha. We set up the signs, on the sidewalk, &amp; got going to start to witness in front of Planned Parenthood where they kill little babies for money.&#160; All of a sudden there appears Jerry &amp; he went across the street to pray &amp; witness with the graphic sign of Malachi the aborted baby who was found in a dumpster &amp; retrieved by prolifers &amp; reassembled by a prolife physician.&#160; Malachi is such a witness &amp; this sign has been used by the Lord to save many babies.&#160;&#160;This picture&#160;is the Truth about abortion.&#160; Tucker has now arrived &amp; has put up the rest of the signs, on the street.&#160; Martha took the mega phone &amp; is now on the side right in front of Planned Parenthood, on the brick side.&#160; She is telling the Truth constantly with conviction to the people going in &amp; out of this abortion mill.&#160; I was on the side by the trees that Planned Parenthood put up to block our vision to the parking lot, which has not affected us in the least.&#160; A desperate measure by desperate people that murder little defenseless people.&#160; All three sides to the building were covered with people of prayer &amp; witness.&#160; Just then a young girl turned the corner to the sidewalk where I was standing.&#160; I spoke with her &amp; then invited her to come to the center for a pregnancy test, just she did.&#160; I asked her, as we were walking to the center, if she was pregnant would she keep her baby &amp; she said "yes".&#160; I was relieved.&#160; As we were talking after she administered her test if she had any children &amp; she said "no".&#160; I then said "I know that you would never have an abortion" to which she smiled nervously at me.&#160; My heart sank.&#160; She said "I've had 2 abortions at Planned Parenthood".&#160; Oh my Lord!&#160; Here she is 17 &amp; has had 2 children killed by abortion.&#160; I said how could you have gone back to Planned Parenthood, where they killed 2 of your children, for a pregnancy test?&#160; She looked shocked herself to that realization.&#160; I spoke to her about Post Abortion help &amp; that we are now offering a 12 Step Bible Study/Healing Course at the center here on Thursdays &amp; for her to try to come &amp; bring her friends too.&#160; She said "okay".&#160; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; also other pertinent information regarding her life situation.&#160; I asked for her to ask Jesus to forgive her for what she did.&#160; Where were her parents? &#160;Or were they the ones to have talked her into having her babies killed, like the family from yesterday, which did nothing to try to save their family member from being killed.&#160; A 'silent family' that let this baby's life be ended at Planned Parenthood.&#160;They all&#160;claimed that&#160;knew the Lord &amp; went to church but went into Planned Parenthood anyway,&#160;to have His creation killed there, because 'she already had a child'.&#160; I guess&#160;2 babies&#160;is&#160;2 to many for this daughter.&#160;How&#160;Evil! &#160;Just keep on having the sex &amp; killing your children, people.&#160;Does that make sense?&#160; When is it going to stop?&#160; Sex was designed, by the Lord, to bring forth&#160;a 'New Life', so when you have sex don't be surprised that you could get pregnant. If you do get pregnant, by having sex, then please 'LET YOU BABY LIVE'! DON'T KILL YOUR BABY! &#160;Please don't tell me anymore that you know Jesus because 'YOU DO NOT'&#160;and 'HE DOES NOT KNOW YOU'.&#160; You have to REPENT to get back into His graces &amp;&#160;then to make Reparation for that horrible sin, of abortion.&#160; Ask Jesus to forgive you 'FOR YOUR SIN AGAINST HIM OF TAKING A LIFE', with a sincere heart, &amp; He will, do it NOW.&#160; 'Don't die in your sin'.&#160; </font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4" color="#000000"><img width="62" height="86" src="http://ac4.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/8dc771e711d2c670" alt="i76.photobucket.com/albums/j20/christina1972/1AJesus_Holding_aborted_baby.jpg" title="http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j20/christina1972/1AJesus_Holding_aborted_baby.jpg" style="width: 90px; height: 117px;" /></font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">When I returned to the sidewalk Martha told me that while I was gone she had a woman, who was dressed very nice, came around the corner to talk to her.&#160; Martha holds the picture of Jesus very sad looking holding&#160;an&#160;aborted baby in His hands.&#160; She said to Martha that she liked the picture very much but the other pictures were not 'in love'.&#160; That's all about the love.

I didn't get to far with him.&#160; I did tell him to "grow up" with his immature antics that he was displaying.&#160; The regular &amp; longtime prolifer came just a few minutes later &amp; he ended up on the brick side of the building closest to where they were sitting.&#160; I knew that he would try to reach them&#160;&#160;I was glad, for I knew that Martha was not coming today because she was not feeling well.&#160; I stayed on the side by the trees &amp; Bill was still across the street.&#160; Charles came a little while later with a Wendy's hamburger for my lunch&#160;so I wouldn't faint.&#160; Wolfed it down because I feel that it doesn't look good, out there in front of the abortion mill, eating.&#160; It's hard when I go to noon Mass then out to the abortion mill without food.&#160;&#160;I need to be in front of Planned Parenthood to try to save babies lives.&#160; All of a sudden I heard some noise &amp; looked over to where the prolifer was standing &amp; saw that the girl &amp; guy was in his face hollering at him.&#160; I heard him say "how could you say that you care about kids when they kill kids here, I'm a Teacher &amp; I know about kids".&#160; They were now walking away from him &amp; then went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I looked in the parking by the fence &amp; I saw that some kids were&#160;playing with one of the Death Escorts, I almost threw up.&#160;&#160;I hollered to a woman, who I saw leaning&#160;on a car, that it was not proper to have the kids play with someone who helps to kill kids, by opening the door for the mother, to go in there to have her child killed.&#160; What is the matter with people?&#160; These poor kids&#160;were exposed to such EVIL &amp;&#160;the other prolifer was also addressing this sad&#160;situation.&#160; About 20 minutes later, a car was pulling out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; I almost fainted for there was the effeminate brother, the kids &amp; the&#160;mother of&#160;the daughter, who was&#160;in the back seat, who had the abortion on Tuesday, drive out of the parking lot.&#160; The grandmother, of the aborted baby,&#160;gave me an evil eye &amp; I returned it with a stern look on my face.&#160; You crazy people repent!&#160; I had to get a grip in order to continue to witness to others.&#160;

then I saw the young couple sitting on the bench again so I started to talk to them hoping that she didn't have an abortion today.&#160; I signaled over to David to come over with a Truth packet so I could try to offer it again to them.&#160; Just then they got up off the bench &amp; walked across the street over to us 3 pro lifers, who were standing there.&#160; The young girl got in my face &amp; said something that I cannot print here on my web site.&#160; I said to her "don't talk to me that way".&#160; Then her boyfriend said that I should have been aborted.&#160; I looked at him to say 'what is the matter with you'?&#160; How nutty were the things that they were saying.&#160; I reached into the packet to get out the Growth &amp; Development pictures of growing babies in the womb to show them.&#160; They were looking at the graphic picture that I was also holding, more closely.&#160; They said that they were here for a miscarriage.&#160; I said to them why would you come here &amp; not to the emergency room or your own doctor?&#160; This place kills babies &amp; is not a good place for you to be at.&#160; The girl started to holler at the prolifer again that she did earlier that afternoon.&#160; She said "you were not nice to those children, you said that they shouldn't be&#160;here for this is a bad place".&#160; So, what he said was fine &amp; it was not mean but true.&#160; She didn't understand the evil that is present here at Planned Parenthood.&#160; The prolifer has been sidewalk counseling for many years &amp; he knows what to say &amp; trusts in the Lord for his comments to the people that he is counseling.&#160; The rain was now coming down.&#160; As they were walking back to Planned Parenthood I said to them "now it's time to grieve the loss of&#160;your baby".&#160; I said it with gentleness for I also have had a miscarriage, from a gang rape in 1971 @ SMH&#160;&amp; I know how it feels.&#160; All of a sudden the guy is pulling&#160;down his pants in the middle of the street.&#160; What!!!&#160; What caused him to do this?&#160; How messed up these two young people are.&#160; I hollered over to them that I was going to call the police.&#160; I went over to the other side of the street where my container was with&#160;paper &amp;

A little while latter she said that she went to the Sacrament of Confession &amp; came back to the Church.&#160; Now she is&#160;going to Mass every Sunday.&#160; Rona is Post Abortive &amp; the Lord has worked a beautiful work in her.&#160;

put the other in the refrig for my supper later on, for I'll be here till 8PM tonight because of the '12 Step Bible Study' Program at 6PM.&#160; As I was eating in came Suzanne, our Thursday counselor.&#160; I greeted her by saying "hi Godmother" for we share the same baby's baptism, our little Akira, our preemie baby that was born &amp; not aborted.&#160; I talked with her for a few minutes then went back out side.&#160; I used the cell phone to order more 'Love Matters' newspapers that we put in our Truth packets.&#160; As I was walking back to the sidewalk where the trees were I saw that the 5 prolifers were standing across the street praying &amp; the other prolifer was standing by the brick side of the building.&#160; Rona &amp; I were by the trees.&#160;&#160;Planned Parenthood&#160;was covered on all sides with prayer power.&#160; Just then the police came.&#160; She walked over to the 5 prolifers who were standing across the street.&#160; I walked over to them to see what was happening.&#160; It seemed that the neighbor, who lives in the last condo, called the police &amp; said that the prolifers were blocking the driveway, which they weren't &amp; I told the female police officer that.&#160; She said that there has never been any trouble with any of us over the years.&#160; I said "thank you".&#160; I said that I was standing&#160;across the street &amp; when the neighbor beeped his horn, at the prolifer, he moved more to the middle &amp; that he was never blocking the entrance to their driveway nor refused to move.&#160; She said that when they get a call they have to come.&#160; I said "I know".&#160; "Okay" she said &amp; have a nice day &amp; then left.&#160;How evil of these two old people to call the police over nothing, they should be ashamed of themselves.&#160; Pro death&#160;people who accept Planned Parenthood as their neighbor what do we expect!&#160;They don't call the police to tell them that they're killing people across the street only that there is a prolifer near their driveway.&#160;

then he went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; The prolifer came over to me &amp; told me that his girlfriend had an appointment about 1/2 hour earlier &amp; that he wasn't&#160;so sure of abortion now, after seeing us out here.&#160; The prolifer told him to go back in there to get her out, which he did.&#160; They came out about 10 minutes later &amp; drove right pass me.&#160; She was looking down but had a smile on her face.&#160;

She has 2 sons &amp; she said to her mom "I think that&#160;it's is girl, because I'm having heart burn".&#160; &#160;I said "why is she having her baby killed"?&#160; The mom replied that she is not getting along with the father".&#160; I said "so, you don't kill your baby because you don't get along with the father of the baby", otherwise none of us would be born".&#160; She said that she would continue to talk with her.&#160; I gave her more literature &amp;

After the Saturday evening Mass, Bill &amp; I went to the center to do some work.&#160; We then went outside to say a Rosary.&#160; As we were standing by the trees, that were planted by Planned Parenthood to block our view, I saw that there was some writing at the entrance to their parking lot.&#160; I went into the street to see what it said.&#160; It read in big bold, black letters, right in the entrance to the driveway, 'BABY KILLER'.&#160; I was surprised for it's us that is always being targeted.&#160; I knew that they won't blame us because they know that we would not do that.&#160; We say it &amp; it is true but we wouldn't write it, otherwise we would have done it years ago.&#160; It could have been a father of a baby that Planned Parenthood killed.&#160; There are a lot of wounded people out there that have been effected by Planned Parenthood's lies &amp; deception.&#160; I went back to the sidewalk to continue praying.&#160; I was holding a sign that read 'Abortion Hurts Women'.&#160; I was standing on the sidewalk when a car came towards me to try to scare me.&#160; He only hurt himself for the Lord will deal with him someday.&#160; I hope &amp; pray that he Repents.&#160; He probably was involved in an abortion for him to react that way.&#160; It doesn't even have to be a graphic sign for someone to try to hurt or kill you out there on the frontlines.

Yeah!&#160; She gave me pictures of aborted babies so that I could put them in a folder to show the girls &amp; educate them when they start talking to me.&#160; These are very graphic pictures that will deeply effect them about abortion, to help save&#160;lives.&#160; I was calling out to the people who were in the parking lot of Planned Parenthood.&#160; One girl was leaning against a car wearing a T-Shirt with a huge skull on it, she was smoking.&#160; I told her that you can't smoke in Planned Parenthood but that you could have a baby killed in there.&#160; She make a weird face at me &amp; continued smoking.&#160; She started to scream out something at me, it was starting already &amp; it will only get worse if she doesn't repent.&#160; She will be tortured by the evil one.&#160; She&#160;had now gone back into Planned Parenthood, how sad.&#160; I continued to speak the Truth to the people going into Planned Parenthood &amp; offering them help.&#160; Martha now showed up &amp; Mary S, had to go back to work.&#160; Three girls were coming down the sidewalk passing out Janis Joplin &amp; John Denver information for an upcoming concert,&#160;in the neighborhood.&#160; One of the girls was pregnant &amp; Martha offered her some baby clothes at the center, she said it was to early but they wanted to see the center so they followed Martha to take a look around.&#160; Martha was gone for some time &amp; when she returned back to the sidewalk she said that a married couple along with the wife's mother came in for a pregnancy test.&#160; They left happy.&#160; They have a little girl who is 3 years old &amp; she will be having a playmate in the near future.&#160; They took a couple of items with them when they left.&#160; I was calling out to the people at Planned Parenthood &amp; a young boy around 13 keep saying "shut up".&#160; I said "no".&#160; He finally came around the bushes with a little girl in the stroller he was pushing.&#160; Martha offered him some baby clothes for her but he said "no" &amp; walked down the street.&#160; Martha noticed that he had a long scar on the back of his neck &amp; was acting sort of funny.&#160; He walked back to the parking lot &amp; about another 15 minutes later his mother came out &amp; they all went into the car.&#160; As they were leaving the parking lot &amp; hollered to the mother that she did a disservice to her family here today.&#160; The boy was in the back seat &amp; he was looking at the graphic sign that I was holding.&#160; Poor baby I'm sorry that your mother put you through this today.&#160; Another car was now pulling out of the parking lot &amp; I said to the mother that I hoped that she buckled her kids in the car.&#160;Don't think so.&#160;No place to bring&#160;your children where they are killing babies.&#160;&#160;Poor parenting.&#160; &#160;Two girls were coming towards Martha &amp; I &amp; we offered them a Truth packet each.&#160; I asked what they were doing going into Planned Parenthood.&#160; The one girls said that she was going in for a Depo shot.&#160; Well Martha set her straight on that.&#160; They went into the mill but came out about 15 minutes later.&#160; She said that she didn't take the shot.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; I said that we have move information in the center &amp; they followed me into the center for more literature &amp; a look around.&#160; I was happy.&#160; When I went back to the sidewalk a woman was walking towards us.&#160; She was an attractive woman who was wearing a bright yellow outfit, she looked stunning.&#160; We spoke with her about Planned Parenthood &amp; gave her a Truth packet, a DVD &amp; a doctors list.&#160; She was convicted &amp; didn't go in for her physical &amp; said that she will call one of the doctors who was on the list when she got home.&#160;I ran into the center to get her more information while she was talking to Martha on the sidewalk.&#160;

Martha said good-bye &amp; I stayed with Melody to do some catch up until 5:45.&#160; Melody had just left &amp; I went to the car to get a flower to put by the tree near Planned Parenthood to denote that there has been a death there.&#160; In this case there has been many deaths there caused by their own hands.&#160; Just as I was leaving to go back to my car &amp; go to my favorite second hand shop to get a great deal on baby clothes &amp; items for the center, I saw that Elaine had just pulled into the parking lot.&#160; I said hi &amp; we went into the center to talk.&#160; She had made up new Intake Sheets for our clients interview &amp; a new sign for our Material Aid room.&#160; She also gave me some new brochures about the Black race &amp; how Planned Parenthood is targeting them.&#160; She was a well of information.&#160; I said that I had to go &amp;

asked if he would like it.&#160; He looked at the cover which showed a Black boy on it.&#160; Immediately he said "that's racist".&#160; I went away from his car &amp; just laughed.&#160; As I was laughing in the parking lot, Elaine went up to his car to try to talk to him.&#160; He just said that "no white person has ever helped a Black person".&#160; Now whose racist Mr. Gantt?&#160; Same o same o.&#160; He hasn't changed, along with the whole neighborhood, 13 years later &amp; everyone is still the same.&#160; Older but no wiser.&#160; How sad.&#160; After he left Elaine &amp; I talked for a few more minutes about what just had happened.&#160; She was wondering why he wasn't in Albany working.&#160; I said that he lives in the Ethiopian restaurant here.&#160; Maybe he's part owner or maybe&#160;he has no where to go in the evening.&#160; I'm glad that he knows that he needs people but not unborn people, to care about.&#160;&#160;&#160;Elaine got into her car &amp; went over to his office to write his phone number down to call &amp; ask why he wasn't in Albany working instead always eating or smoking cigars, tax dollar money going in his stomach or in his lungs.&#160; Ick!&#160; Just then a woman was walking out of the restaurant &amp; going towards his office which is at the opposite end of the same strip mall that we are.&#160; She asked if she could help us.&#160; We told her what just went on with Mr. Ganett.&#160; She said that she was 'pro choice' then I went into a tyrant.&#160; I asked her if she new the Lord &amp; she said "yes &amp; I go to church every Sunday too".&#160; I said well "He doesn't know you".&#160; You can't serve the Lord &amp; say that you know Him &amp; love Him &amp; believe that it's okay to kill His children, by abortion.&#160; It's being a hypocrite!&#160; I knew that Elaine thought that I was the meanest person on&#160;the face of the earth but this young woman needed 'tough love' &amp; I was justifiably angry at her too.&#160; The president of Planned Parenthood goes to church &amp; some of the workers in the Killing Mill go too. &#160;I can't stand it!!!&#160; I said to her "what if you get killed in a car accident on the way home without repenting first"?&#160;&#160; She said "I'll be at heaven's door &amp; I will tell the Lord that I'm pro choice &amp; He'll say "come on it".&#160; I almost threw up.&#160; I was now real worried about her soul.&#160; She told me not to judge for the Bible says so.&#160; I said that the Bible says "to judge &amp; judge wisely".&#160; I'm not judging her heart but her comment.&#160; I've noticed when I talk to people &amp; they start to get uncomfortable, they always go to the judging part.&#160; It doesn't work.&#160; Elaine told me to be quiet for she wanted to quote the Bible to her too, the part about to "Choose Life".&#160; I also mentioned the Commandant of God "Thou Shall Not Kill".&#160; Wow, they always forget this one.&#160; She said "you have your opinion &amp; I have my opinion".&#160; I looked down to the ground &amp; said "what is this that we are standing on"?&#160; "It's concert or do you want to make it be sand"?&#160; It is what it is!&#160; I knew this whole confrontation was of the Lord for His timing &amp; words&#160;are perfect.&#160; I know nothing but I know all things through Christ Jesus.&#160; God be the Glory!&#160;

I wasn't in a good mood because I have this horrible chronic gut pain, like someone is ripping me to shreds inside.&#160; It leaves me a little grumpy.&#160; Martha has a forgiving heart &amp; we get along real well.&#160; She understands.&#160; As we were praying &amp; witnessing on the sidewalk, here comes Bill to pray with us.&#160; We had a client scheduled for a pregnancy test at 4:30PM, so when she arrived Martha went in to administer the test.&#160; I stayed outside with Bill.&#160; Just then a family&#160;with 2 young children probably about 4 &amp; 6 years old, were walking down the sidewalk.&#160;&#160;I offered a Truth packet to the mom &amp; she took it.&#160; The children were looking at the pictures &amp; responding with sympathy for the babies that were ripped apart.&#160; The father went up the street &amp; was gone for about 15 minutes &amp; then came back to meet up with his family.&#160; They were all now walking back up the sidewalk &amp; went&#160;into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I almost fainted.&#160; I called to&#160;the mom&#160;&amp; told her was was she going into an abortion mill?&#160; She said "you don't know why we are going in there so mind your own business".&#160; I said that "this was my business &amp; that they were racist".&#160; She said "I don't live here, I live out of town, so mind your own business".&#160; Then she walked away&#160;to catch up with her poor family.&#160; She seemed nice when she was on the sidewalk.&#160; What happened?&#160; They pulled out of the driveway a few minutes later, so they had been parked in there, all along.&#160;&#160;So confusing. &#160;Bill looked perplexed too how can you not.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4" color="#000000"><img width="124" height="124" src="/Portals/0/misc_pics/Images0009.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">Martha came back out to the sidewalk after being in the center for awhile.&#160;

She mellowed, that's what the Truth can do for you.&#160;She didn't take a Truth packet but she did receive the Truth.&#160; A woman came by riding a bike &amp; she said to me "she did it, she took the pills".&#160; I just then remembered that I&#160;had talked to her last week,&#160;she's the mom. &#160;She told me that her&#160;daughter was scheduled to have an abortion here at Planned Parenthood, this week.&#160; She was the one that thought that she was having a girl because she experienced heartburn &amp; didn't get along with the father.&#160; I gave the mother a DVD &amp; lots of information.&#160; I&#160;asked what she did to stop it &amp; she said that she was over 18 &amp; couldn't do anything.&#160; She certainly isn't a Pat who fought hard to save her 2 great grandbabies from being aborted &amp; one&#160;of the granddaughters is 18&#160;years old.&#160;

Jim Bovay is the neighbor that is harassing us &amp; he received a letter from one of the prolifers lawyer, stating that there could be a possible Law Suit against him if he doesn't leave us alone, when we are praying &amp;

just wait a few minutes.&#160; Just then he came walking from behind the trees towards us, on the sidewalk, with a picture of a young boy.&#160; As he was walking he was talking saying "see this is my son who I put up for adoption 8 years ago, I couldn't do that to him, as he was pointing to my graphic sign.&#160; We almost started to cry.&#160; I asked what he was doing here &amp; he said for a STD test.&#160; I then told him of Compass Care &amp; gave him the address &amp; phone number.&#160; Martha said "you don't want to come to this dirty place that kills children".&#160; He agreed.&#160; I then shook his hand &amp; said "it is a pleasure to have met you, you are rare &amp; God bless you for what you did".&#160; Martha &amp; Donna also took his hand in theirs.&#160; This was a wonderful experience where we were told that a father &amp;

He said that he had brought his girlfriend into Planned Parenthood around 11AM &amp; it was now 1:15PM to get an ultrasound to see how far long she was.&#160; He said that he was NOT abortion minded &amp; he was here to make sure that she wasn't.&#160; He even said that he was going to tell her parents, who were against abortion, about her pregnancy for moral support.&#160; I agreed that this was a good idea if she doesn't tell them first.&#160; He made so much sense I almost kissed him.&#160; He was a breath of fresh air to what a man was suppose to be.&#160; Finally!!&#160; This quote was from Sandi, the Director of Embracing Options:&#160;&#160;A staggering statistic....&#160;<font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"> 75% of the post- abortive women polled, said they would've chosen life, if the father of their child said he'd support that decision</font><font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">.</font>&#160;We need to maybe work on the men in this society too a little more.&#160; They need to step up to the plate &amp; be responsible for their girlfriends pregnancies, for they are the fathers of their children, for it takes 2 to make a baby.&#160; I spoke to this nice young man about Adoption for it is the loving 'choice'.&#160; He agreed that it is.&#160; He said that he makes good money &amp; will provide for his child.&#160; This woman has a good boyfriend &amp; I hope that she appreciates him,&#160; She has a 1 year old at home ( I don't think that he is the father of this child) &amp; will now have a brother or sister for him or her.&#160;I went to the center to get him a&#160;little&#160;baby gift&#160;for his baby &amp; more information.&#160; He was&#160;very receptive &amp; happy when I returned with the gift.&#160; He had a smile on his face.&#160; He was&#160;now on the phone with her &amp; she told him that she was 21?2 months &amp; Planned Parenthood told her that she was to far long for the RU 486 but they could do the surgical procedure, on her.&#160; Her boyfriend said "NO".&#160; He got off the phone &amp;&#160;said "good bye"&#160;&amp; Mary &amp; I said "good bye" to him too.&#160; He went back into Planned Parenthood to get her out of there.&#160; Mary S. had to go back to work but she asked me to let her know what happened after she left.&#160; He said before he&#160;went back into Planned Parenthood to get her,&#160;that he wanted his girlfriend to talk to us. But when they pulled out of the driveway, he had a smile on his face &amp; he tried to stop the car&#160;to talk with me&#160;but his&#160;girlfriend told him to "keep on driving", which he did.&#160;&#160;She was not happy with the news that she was pregnant.&#160;&#160;</strong></font><font color="#000000"><strong><font size="4">Hope that his girlfriend doesn't sneak back to have an abortion, that would break his heart &amp; Mary S. &amp; mine too.</font></strong>&#160;&#160;<strong><font size="4">This man&#160;was&#160;a 'breath of fresh air'.&#160; I&#160;wish there were more like him. </font></strong></font></font></p></div><div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><font size="4" color="#0000ff"><strong>Wednesday, July 29, 2009 in front of Planned Parenthood</strong></font></p></div><div><p><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>I got there at the center before Tucker &amp; went out on the sidewalk by myself.&#160; I knew that he was coming real soon, which he did.&#160; He set up the signs &amp; I counseled.&#160; Martha came later &amp; just when she did I put her to work right away.&#160; As&#160;Martha was getting&#160;out of her car &amp; was talking to Tucker, on the sidewalk,&#160;a young woman was walking up the sidewalk &amp; asked me for a pregnancy test.&#160; I said "sure" &amp; unprofessionally hollered over to Martha to assist this young woman.&#160; We do the best we can running two ministries at the same time, the street &amp; the center.&#160; The woman followed Martha into the Focus center for assistance.&#160; A few minutes later two young girls were walking out of Planned Parenthood &amp; came by me.&#160; I asked if they would like a Truth packet to which they replied "yes", so I gave each of them a packet.&#160; One of the girls said to me "I need a pregnancy test" so I gave them directions for the center.&#160; I knew that Martha was already there &amp; probably was done with the first client by now.&#160; So they went in for assistance.&#160; Tucker was still putting up signs.&#160;&#160;When he was&#160;finished &amp;&#160;was sitting down, on his red chair, praying the Rosary I said to him that I was going into the center to help out Martha, he said that it was a good idea.&#160; When I arrived at the center I saw that the two girls were coming out after they took the test.&#160; They looked happy &amp; I said "good bye, &amp; if you need us we will be here for you &amp; no sex before marriage &amp; stay close to Jesus for He loves you so".&#160; They smiled &amp; then left.&#160; Our other client was in the Material Aid room getting clothes for her 2 sons at home.&#160; She was not pregnant &amp; said to me "I want to get pregnant, I want a girl".&#160; I then said to her "are you married"?&#160; She answered "no".&#160; Then I said "why do think that you should get pregnant if you're not married,&#160;no sex outside of marriage".&#160; She then said "I'm not ready for marriage".&#160; I felt like saying "but you're ready&#160;for sex &amp; no marriage", topsy turvey society.&#160; I didn't want to appear hostile or judgmental but educational towards her.&#160; She was a nice woman who reads to her children every night,&#160; I admire that. &#160;I could tell that she loves her children too.

This was&#160;in regards to a sign that one of the prolifers had put on the poll,&#160;that looks like a cross, near his property.&#160; We thought it was on public property because it has a 'No Parking' sign on the poll.&#160;I came over from the other side of the street to see what was going on.&#160;I said to him "don't touch our sign or I'll have you arrested", for he threatened to take it down &amp; I want no "pro deather' to touch&#160;our signs out of&#160;respect for the 'fallen children'.&#160;"Call the police if you want to" I said&#160;because I wanted this situation to be straightened out so it wouldn't ever happen again.&#160; So he did.&#160; He was so disrespectful to me that it would have curled your hair if you had heard him speak.&#160; The police came &amp; it was determined that the poll &amp; our sign, which was on it, was on his property, so we took it down.&#160; The prolifer had also put a sign on the tree by the Telemarketers business, next to the condos&#160;&amp; the police involved him in this discrepancy.&#160; When I found out that he was going to call the Mayor's office, in regards to this situation, Rob &amp; I went in to speak with him.&#160; He is the owner of the 2 buildings which are up For Sale.&#160; I said to him that we will not put our signs that far up the street near his property &amp; he said "okay".&#160; I then asked him about his 2 buildings &amp; that I heard that there was a sale pending.&#160; He said "no there is no sale pending".&#160; I asked him how much he was asking for the property.&#160; He said "$175,000".&#160; It was at one time $199,000.&#160; The property has been For Sale for many years.&#160; Oh, how I wish that we as prolifers could buy that property &amp; have a&#160;&#160;'Life Giving' Medical Center there to counteract Planned Parenthood's evil.&#160; Something like CompassCare's Medical Facility&#160;but embracing ALL pregnancy centers, in caring for those girls in need of our help, during&#160;their pregnancies &amp;&#160;afterwards.&#160;&#160;Maybe someday with God's power &amp;

I came over to the center after the noon Mass at Our Lady of Victory.&#160; I was so happy to have Martha come early to be with Mary S. &amp; I on the sidewalk. I got everything that we needed to go out to the frontlines.&#160; Mary S. &amp; I stayed on the side, by the trees, &amp; Martha went with the mega phone &amp; a Truth packet, right in front of Planned Parenthood, on the brick side of the building.&#160; We were there about 15 minutes when I went into the center to get some bottle water for us, the temperature was 82 degrees.&#160; I went over to where Martha was to give her the water &amp; another Truth packet, for she had already given a packet to a young girl who had just walked out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; As I was talking to Martha, I noticed one of the workers at Planned Parenthood that I had talked to briefly a couple of times in the past, walking towards us.&#160; I said to her "if you want me to help get you a job you have to tell me what I'm to look for".&#160; She then said back to me "I have just 1 more hear before I can retire &amp; the hospitals do abortions &amp; it is legal &amp; I can't tell people what to do &amp; they'll find a way to do it if they want to".&#160; Stop! &#160;It&#160;sounded like all the clichés that I hear all the time from people.&#160;The clincher was that she had just professed that she was a Christian &amp; knew the Lord.&#160; Oh no, here we go again!!&#160; Another misguided, compromising Christian.&#160; She said "keep up your ministry".&#160; I said "the Lord doesn't want you here".&#160; She replied&#160; "I was working at Strong Memorial &amp; wanted to get out &amp; I prayed &amp; the Lord brought me here&#160;to Planned Parenthood".&#160; I said "the Lord wouldn't bring you to a place where they are killing His children &amp; maybe you heard the Devil prompting you to come here&#160;&amp; NOT the Lord".&#160; "Oh No" she replied "the Lord brought me here &amp; you don't know what I do in there &amp; maybe I do good in there".&#160; Maybe you could do more good out here than in there.&#160; It sounded like she was saying that she goes against the Planned Parenthood's agenda &amp; I don't think so because if that was true &amp; Planned Parenthood found out about it, I think that they would have fired her". They are in the business to do 'evil' &amp; Christians shouldn't put themselves in that position.&#160; We asked her her name &amp; she told us &amp; we told her that we will be praying for her to get away from Planned Parenthood.&#160; A few minutes later another worker was walking out to mail a letter &amp; I said to her "it seems that there are more Christians in Planned Parenthood than out on the sidewalk"&#160; Where are all the Christians praying &amp; peacefully protesting, in front of this place, where that are murdering God's children? &#160;As this woman scandalized me, we're also&#160;scandalizing her, for a lack of representation in defending life, in front of Planned Parenthood.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4"><img width="120" height="97" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/1633738399.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />
Martha &amp; I were standing, by the trees, when a car drove in &amp; parked by the fence where we standing on the sidewalk.&#160; I went over to the fence &amp; started to talk to the 2 girls that were in the car when all of a sudden I saw our small sign that reads 'The Pill Kills' swept away by the wind &amp; landing in Planned Parenthood's parking lot.&#160; Oh no I thought, this is a relativity new sign &amp; I don't want them to take it &amp; it's is in their parking lot so I can't get it.&#160; So I decided to call on the goodness of the 2 girls in the car.&#160; I hollered over to them asking if they would go get the sign that blew in from the sidewalk.&#160; They hesitated for a minute &amp; I asked again &amp; one of the girls got out of the car &amp; went over to the sign picked it up &amp; read it &amp; carried it over to us on the sidewalk.&#160; This was God's plan for these 2 girls &amp; their friend, who was in Planned Parenthood, at the time.&#160; We thanked her for her kindness to us in getting the sign &amp; she started to talk with us.&#160; She saw the graphic signs that were out on the sidewalk &amp; started to ask some questions.&#160; She said that she had had an abortion &amp; was pregnant again &amp; wouldn't have another abortion again.&#160; We asked if she needed any baby clothes &amp; she said that it was to early.&#160; Just then her friend got out of the car &amp; came over us.&#160; We started to talk with her &amp; she said that she had had 2 abortions &amp; one not to long ago.&#160; I was upset with all this horrible information &amp; asked her why she had an abortion.&#160; She replied "I already have a kid".&#160; I said you have 3 kids &amp; 2 of them are in Heaven. Your child, at home, has lost 2 brothers or sisters &amp; will wonder why you didn't kill him either.&#160; It will put a wedge between you &amp; your child until you both can work it out with God's help.&#160; I asked her if she had asked God to forgive her &amp; she said "yes, many times".&#160; I said that I was glad to hear this.&#160; Her friend, who had 1 abortion was hearing this.&#160; Martha &amp; I gave them a lot of information &amp; a 10 week old plastic baby, to keep &amp; show.&#160; I then asked why they were there now.&#160; They said "our friend is there for a 2 part session, the first part is the ultrasound to see how old the baby is &amp; <br />
the other is the procedure.&#160; Martha suggested that they receive a DVD, which I gave them along with some graphic pictures that the girls requested for their friend to see.&#160; They also took another 10 week old plastic baby for their friend.&#160; They said that they had to go &amp; thanked Martha &amp; I for the help.&#160; We said to them as they left, for them to be 'life saviors' for their friend's little baby, his or hers life is depending on it.&#160; We all said 'good-bye" &amp; they left to go back to their car.&#160; About 5 minutes later, as they were driving out, the one girl that we spoke with, was smiling &amp; I noticed that their friend, who was sitting in the back seat was looking at the graphic pictures &amp; was crying.&#160; I knew at that point that she'll never be back, at Planned Parenthood, to have her baby killed.&#160; Thank you Lord, for you work in strange &amp; mysterious ways &amp; this incident surly proves it.&#160; God is in the 'Life Saving' business.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4"><img width="84" height="125" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/3298295359.jpg" alt="" style="width: 84px; height: 107px;" /></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="4">David Gantt drove by &amp; instead of giving us his middle finger, he spit out the window, this time.&#160; How to you spell 'crass &amp; vulgar'.&#160; Why can't this man behave &amp; act like a gentleman?&#160; The man has no matters &amp; little does he know that Martha is in his district &amp; he has sent her a Mother's Day card on Mother's Day, I guess he's forgotten.&#160; I hope that she finds time to give him a call.&#160; Go Martha!!<br /><br />

When I arrived there at 4:30PM Tucker &amp; Bill were starting to put the signs out.&#160; I went to the sidewalk &amp; was counseling when I saw 3 women walking up the sidewalk.&#160; Tucker was just telling me about a fellow worker who had just broke his neck diving in&#160;2 feet of water in the Irondequoit Bay.&#160;&#160; He hit bottom real fast &amp; broke his neck &amp; will never walk again.&#160; Thank God he is alive &amp; has the use of his hands.&#160; One of the women came up to me &amp; said "Mary this is Precious, do you remember me"?&#160; I said "yes, from work", she left&#160;the company&#160;about 3 years ago.&#160; Tucker told her about Jeremy, who she knew from work, about what just had happened to him this past week.&#160; She was surprised &amp; felt badly about the news.&#160; We talked for a few minutes &amp; we all went into the center for some baby clothes&#160;for her pregnant cousin, who was with her &amp; her mother.&#160; Nice family.&#160; We talked some more in the center &amp; I&#160;gave away some nice things for the baby boy who will be born soon.&#160; I said "good bye"&#160;to everyone&#160;&amp; gave a hug to Precious &amp; said "be blessed in mind, body &amp; spirit" &amp; off I went back to the frontlines.&#160; A few minutes later a pro lifer came on the sidewalk who lives far away to be with us tonight.&#160; After awhile I had asked her if she would go into the center to get the camera because I wanted to take a picture of the obnoxious guy that drives by &amp; says awful things, on Wednesdays.&#160; When she came back out she told me that she had&#160;left&#160;my keys in the center. &amp; the door was locked.&#160; Thank God that Tucker was still there with his keys&#160;&amp; I went to the center to go get mine.&#160; As I was there the doorbell rang &amp; it was a client coming&#160;in for&#160;baby clothes.&#160; A few minutes later Tucker came in to say "good bye' to which I replied "good bye" back to him&#160;&amp; he left.&#160; A few minutes later I realized that I was holding his keys in my hands &amp; forgot to give them back to him.&#160; I'll call him later to let him know that I have them &amp; I'll give them back to him next Wednesday.&#160; This was 'forget the keys' night.&#160; When I went back to the frontlines there was Bill &amp; Ann.&#160; Thank God that Planned Parenthood's parking lot was empty.&#160; I only spoke to a couple of girls tonight &amp; handed out one Truth packet.&#160; It was about 6:30PM &amp; we put the signs away &amp; Ann had to go.&#160; Bill &amp; I went into the center &amp; did some painting &amp; odd jobs, that I usually don't have time to do during the week, so this was good that I had the time now&#160;&amp; Bill to help me.&#160; I drove him home about an hour later &amp; then went to the Racket Club to do some water walking.</font></strong>&#160;</div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">Thursday, August 6, 2009 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></strong></p><div><p><strong><font size="4">When I arrived at the front lines I noticed that there were no cars in the Planned Parenthood parking lot except the abortionist, Rachael Phelps car parked by the second doorway to the building.&#160; This is where she always parks.&#160; I was sad to see her there about to kill little babies.&#160; Another prolifer arrived a few minutes after I arrived.&#160; He took his post by the brick side to the building&#160;with the mega phone &amp; a box full of Truth packets &amp; Rosaries to hand out.&#160; I was posted on the sidewalk by the big blocking trees.&#160; there were no cars coming until about 1:30 or so.&#160; The 2 cars that went in came out only after a few minutes in the Killing Mill.&#160; I handed the one car a Truth packet as they drove by me.&#160;&#160;The counselor came &amp; I let her in &amp; spoke with her for a few minutes.&#160; She&#160;didn't have lunch yet so she&#160;brought her meal with her &amp; was wolfing it down when I left to go back to the sidewalk.&#160; A few minutes later&#160;a young girl &amp; an older woman came out of Planned Parenthood &amp; came around the trees.&#160; I said to them "can I help you" &amp; the older woman said "no, thank you".&#160; Then I heard her say something about a pregnancy test so I quickly chimed in &amp; said "we can give you a free pregnancy test&#160;in our center right next to this yellow building".&#160; She said "okay" &amp; they followed me to the center.&#160;&#160;The counselor&#160;answered the door, for my keys where in the container on the sidewalk.&#160; I introduced them to her. I had with me a little plastic baby that is 10 weeks old &amp;&#160;gave it&#160;to the young girl.&#160; I said "I don't know if you're pregnant but this is a cute baby to have &amp; to show your friends".&#160; They followed the counselor &amp; I was off again to the sidewalk.&#160; They were in good hands with this great counselor.&#160; This was a mother &amp; daughter &amp; the daughter was abortion minded &amp; the mother was not.&#160; Let's hope &amp; pray that the mother wins out &amp; she will be holding her little grand baby in her arms next year &amp; so will the mom.&#160; Why do woman &amp; girls&#160;think that they can KILL their babies!!!!&#160; This is frightening a mind set to think this way.&#160; No mother has a right to&#160;have her unborn baby killed.&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4"><img width="150" height="112" src="/Portals/0/protest_pics/3052975147.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">Martha had now&#160;arrived &amp; was on the sidewalk praying &amp; Charles had come &amp; brought me 2 Wendy's hamburgers for me to wolf down.&#160; Again, I don't like to eat on the streets, but I don't want to faint either because I come from church &amp; not my home I don't have a chance to eat lunch.&#160; Lunch was over &amp; during that time there were 2 prolifers in charge of&#160;calling out to the girls to help them. &#160;Come Holy Spirit come!&#160; I looked over in the parking lot &amp; saw that the Death Escort,Melissa was there standing by the door wearing her blue Planned Parenthood apron.&#160; How very sad.&#160; Then I saw a young girl coming out of Planned Parenthood &amp; turning the corner where the male profiler was standing.&#160; She stopped to talk to him for a few minutes then he called to me to come over to him.&#160; When I got to his side he said to me that this young girl was pregnant &amp; was thinking of an abortion.&#160; I said "no sweetheart you don't want to do that to your precious baby, come &amp; I'll have you speak to our counselor at the center".&#160; So we crossed the street to the other side &amp; re crossed the street to the side of the center.&#160; I rang the doorbell, for I still didn't have my keys with me, &amp; Suzanne answered the door.&#160; I introduced her to the counselor &amp; they walked down the hallway to the counseling room.&#160; I said "good bye" &amp; went back to the sidewalk.&#160; She was in there for quite awhile &amp; when she came back out Martha &amp; I spoke with her some more.&#160; We encouraged her to take care of herself &amp; her baby &amp; that everything will work out just fine &amp; if&#160;she ever needed anything&#160;to please come back.&#160; We gave her lots of literature &amp; the plastic baby &amp; a DVD.&#160; We are in the 'Life Saving' business NOT the Planned Parenthood's 'Killing Business' of innocent human lives created by God &amp; redeemed by the Lord Jesus.&#160; </font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4"><img width="90" height="125" src="/Portals/0/protest_pics/3159279086.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p></div><div><p><strong><font size="4">The counselor had to go early today &amp;

So now there was Martha &amp; I standing by the big trees praying &amp; counseling.&#160; I ran into the center to do something quickly &amp; when I came back out Martha had said that she spoke with Melissa, the Death Escort, as she was passing her by on the sidewalk, leaving from Planned Parenthood to go home.&#160; Martha had seen a pin on Melissa that read ' support gay marriage'.&#160; Martha told her gently that marriage was between a man &amp; a woman not 2 people of the same sex.&#160; Melissa didn't seem to agree but she did here the Truth.&#160;

Then the&#160;driver pulled down the window to said to me "..... ..." with an angry look on her face.&#160;&#160;I knew, by her reaction, that her friend just had an abortion &amp; she had been with her all along, she was what you call 'an accomplice to the crime of murder'.&#160; This will affect her the rest of her life &amp; maybe some day her friend will hate her for bringing her here to have her baby killed.&#160; Girlfriends don't do this.&#160; It's called 'false compassion' &amp; is very wrong.&#160; Abortion is murder no matter what the circumstances the pregnant mom is experiencing.&#160; We, at the center, want &amp; can help them both.&#160; Pregnancy is temporary &amp; motherhood is forever.&#160;

This was Donna's idea &amp; we have been blessed with the praising the Lord at&#160;the abortion facility.&#160; The Devil can't stand it &amp; flees.&#160; More lives saved then.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; It was now about 5:15pm &amp; Martha was going into the center to put the Radio/ CD player away.&#160; Just then, a couple with a darling 4 year old girl, was walking down the sidewalk.&#160; They stopped to talk with us &amp;&#160;they weren't afraid of the graphic signs that were out there.&#160; I then said to the parents that we, at the center, have some toys &amp; stuffed animals &amp; books&#160;for their daughter.&#160; They then followed Martha into the center along with the CD player for some special things for their daughter to get.&#160; I was by myself now, it was taking Martha longer than I had thought.&#160; I looked over to my right side &amp; saw that a Police car was coming in my direction &amp; was stopping right in front of me.&#160; "Hi Officer Mike, how are you today"?.&#160; "I'm fine" he replied.&#160; "Did you catch the guy that spit on the face of one of our prolifers yet" I said.&#160; "No, not yet" was his replay.&#160; Then he said that he got a call that there was a horn like noise coming from us.&#160; I said "it's just me Officer Mike &amp; my mega phone doesn't make that kind of noise".&#160; He called it in &amp; told the Sergeant that it wasn't Mary who was making the noise.&#160; We said a few more things &amp; he said "good bye " &amp; left.&#160; A few minutes later another Officer came by saying "are you the one who is using the horn devise that was just called in"?&#160; "Only kidding" he then said, I can be funny like this at times.&#160; Why he chose now is my question.&#160; I said to him "you must be more funny after a few beers", he laughed.&#160; I said to him "what was the call like?&#160; He said it was called in that 'a group of protesters were using a horn like device, on University Ave. by Gibbs.&#160; How&#160;wrong the complaint&#160;was Officer, to which he agreed.&#160; For like I said there was just me standing alone with no horn like device. &#160;It wasn't the mega phone because that wasn't the description &amp; the Officer had told the Sergeant that he has checked the mega phone to the noise code &amp; it passed.&#160; It wasn't the CD player either for this was not the description the person gave the 911 operator. So I don't know who this poor misguided pro abort person was.&#160;&#160;You think that he or she would have more important things&#160;to do then&#160;call 911 for this.&#160;&#160; An update to this complaint:&#160; I ran it by one of the prolifers&#160;who was out there earlier &amp; he said that the Buckpitt business, next to Planned Parenthood, was using Jackhammers that afternoon.&#160; The poor person thought that we were making that noise.&#160; Sorry!&#160; I will call 911&#160;soon &amp; get a hold of Officer Mike to tell him&#160;what it was for the record.&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4"><a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://concierge.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/03/26/mercedes_rental_car_greve_in_chiant.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/blogs/perrinpost/car_rental/&amp;h=339&amp;w=600&amp;sz=71&amp;tbnid=Ll09aD83rueD5M:&amp;tbnh=76&amp;tbnw=135&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dpictures%2Bof%2Ba%2Bcar&amp;hl=en&amp;usg=__JPQr2fumivhST7Au4JK0Od51lYA=&amp;ei=afCJSvXhLIrYNpr1pckE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=image"><img width="135" height="76" border="1" align="middle" src="http://www.google.com/images?q=tbn:Ll09aD83rueD5M::concierge.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/03/26/mercedes_rental_car_greve_in_chiant.jpg" alt="http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/blogs/perrinpost/car_rental/" title="http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/blogs/perrinpost/car_rental/" style="margin: 3px;" /></a></font></strong></p></div><div><strong><font size="4">After the 2 Police cars had gone, Officer Mike &amp; Officer Funny Guy, I was still by myself, on the sidewalk.&#160; Martha still hadn't come out with the family that were invited in for&#160;some things for their daughter.&#160; As I was standing there, a car with a male driver in it, stopped in the&#160;middle of the street&#160;&amp; said to me "you are dedicated aren't you".&#160; I said back to him "if it's to save a life then maybe I am but I'm only doing what is required of me as a Christian".&#160; He said "this world has done crazy".&#160; I said "don't fear anything for the Lord is in control &amp; has conquered the world though&#160;the&#160;cross".&#160; &#160;He drove away smiling &amp; more comforted by these words which was inspired by the Holy Spirit.&#160; Just then I saw Martha walking towards me &amp; I said&#160;"is everything all right"?&#160; She said that the family had another child at home with her sister &amp; she was getting clothes for her.&#160; I said " I thought that I saw them walking down the street with 3 bags full.&#160; She laughed &amp; I then told her what had&#160;happened to me while she was gone.&#160;&#160;We put everything away &amp; went into the center to talk &amp; to eat.&#160; Janet came later for the '12 Step Bible Study'&#160;course &amp; we got to talk with her for awhile.&#160; Martha had to go &amp; Janet &amp; I stayed to share some more.&#160;Later that evening around 6:30 PM I went back to the sidewalk at Planned Parenthood to put a flower by the tree to repesent the crimes against humanity that is being done in there &amp; to my joy there wasn't a car in the driveway except the staff &amp; the abortionst was gone too.&#160; Alleluia!!</font></strong>&#160;</div><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff">Tuesday, August 11, 2009 in front of Planned Parenthood<br /></font><br /></font></strong><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>When I arrived to the center &amp; notice that a young mother was coming out of Planned Parenthood with a young child, in a stroller.&#160; I quickly got out of the car &amp; asked the mom if she would like some baby clothes for her daughter.&#160; She asked how much &amp; I told her that they were 'free'.&#160; Tim followed me from Church to give the center a bag of stuffed animals, which I accepted right away.&#160; I brought the mom &amp; her child into the Material Aid room &amp; she helped herself to some nice clothes for her child.&#160; He daughter was head strong but cute.&#160; I gave her a stuffed animal which she immediately threw to the floor.&#160; She started to cry &amp; the mom said that she was spoiled. I wanted the mom to trust me.&#160; I finally asked her if she was going to have an abortion &amp; she said "no" but her head was down, she didn't give me eye contact.&#160; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; told her that Planned Parenthood was evil &amp; that they target the Black women especially.&#160; I said if she need anything for her to let us know.&#160; She said "good bye" &amp; I said "good bye" to her &amp; her darling daughter.&#160; I then went into the meeting room to find that my tablecloth &amp; bathroom soap dispenser &amp; air spray were taken, from the meeting room.&#160; You can't trust anyone.&#160; I was angry &amp; called the person who had used the room over the weekend.&#160; He apparently let some group use the room on Sunday &amp; they helped themselves.&#160; I will get these things back, if it has to come out of the pocket of the pastor, of the Deliverance Church, which also uses this room.&#160; I started to bring things out to the sidewalk when Mary S. came in to get the signs for the street ministry.&#160; When we got to the sidewalk there was a red pick up truck that was parked by the fence with 2 young guys in it.&#160; I asked them if they knew what Planned Parenthood does in there &amp; the one guy said "yes".&#160; I said "you know that they kill babies &amp; it's alight with you".&#160; The one guy said "yes".&#160; I knew that I was going to have a horrible time today which turned out to be more than true. I feel that I'm in a Twightlight Zone episode that won't end.&#160; I tried to talk to them some more &amp; then the other guy took out his camera, probably cell phone camera &amp; started to take my picture.&#160; I said to Mary S. that I was glad that I was having a good hair day.&#160; I then looked over to the guys &amp; told them to "grow up".&#160; I asked Mary S. if she would be okay if I went back into the center to get more signs &amp;

the young man waved to me.&#160; Don't it figure that they are so friendly coming out of a Killing Mill.&#160; I just scratch my head in amazement.&#160; The car stopped by the sidewalk where Mary S. &amp; I were standing &amp; she reassured us that she wasn't here for an abortion but that Planned Parenthood, helped her to get pregnant, by referring her to a doctor who&#160;took out her bladder tumors.&#160;If a serial killer does some nice things he's still a serial killer, isn't he?&#160; &#160;I said to her that if&#160;you wanted&#160;your&#160;baby&#160;aborted they would have had no problem to&#160;have killed your baby for $$$.&#160; She said that she would never do that but understands if other women wanted to.&#160; Oh really, poor lady, that makes no sense at all.&#160; "Look at the kids on the street &amp; how they live" she said.&#160; I replied back to her that she should not play God, that when He created life that's what He wanted &amp; The Commandment of God says "Thou Shall NOT Kill".&#160; Remember that Planned Parenthood is evil &amp; no excuses.&#160; Mary S. handed her a Truth packet.</strong></font></p><p align="center"><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong><img width="120" height="111" src="/Portals/0/angry woman.jpg" alt="" style="width: 171px;

I looked up to see that a woman had her head out the window screaming at Mary S. &amp; I.&#160; She was out of control &amp; was now driving on the wrong side of the street.&#160; I looked down at the car with the 4 people &amp; said "good bye" &amp; to look at the information that you just received.&#160; When they had gone I asked Mary S. if the car with the screaming female went up the street.&#160; She said "no, she pulled into the Planned Parenthood parking lot".&#160; I thought to myself "Oh my God this might be rough &amp; it was.&#160; It was the most rough case that I can remember, in a long time, though every case is rough when you are trying to get the mom, through the grace of God, to change her mind &amp; not to have her baby killed.&#160; The war was on!!&#160; She came around the bushes &amp; landed on Mary S. &amp; I with a ton of bricks.&#160; She looked at the graphic picture that Mary S. was holding &amp; said to us that is what she was planning to do.&#160; She said things that you could not believe that anyone would say.&#160; She then went back into the parking lot to be with her boyfriend, standing by&#160;her car smoking a cigarette.&#160; I was at the fence side still&#160; trying to talk to her when all of a sudden I saw 2 guys in pink shirts standing next to her.&#160; The one was Rick Bartell, who has worked at Planned Parenthood, for years &amp; the president of this&#160;Killing Mill, James Stewart.&#160; They were taking to her &amp; then lead her, along with her very quiet&#160;boyfriend, into the dragon's mouth.&#160;&#160;Our&#160;hearts dropped, we felt sick to our stomachs.&#160;

She came over &amp; we talked for awhile.&#160; She wasn't hollering at this time.&#160; I said many things to her &amp; she said many things also.&#160; One, was I mentioned "adoption is a loving option".&#160; She said "no it isn't, I don't want my baby to be given to parents that will sexually abuse him or her".&#160; I said "that's not going&#160;to happen".&#160; Then she said "don't you watch the TV program 20/20.&#160; I sure wished that she didn't.&#160; I told her that I am an incest survivor, have been molested, been gang raped &amp; lost twins by a miscarriage 6 weeks after the rape &amp; other things have happened to me also.&#160; I said " are you saying that I shouldn't be here because I had so many bad&#160;things happen to me".&#160; I survived &amp; I'm glad that God created me&#160;&amp; was born in this world.&#160; You will be fine.&#160; Just stop smoking &amp; the doctor can give you medication for your nerves, she said earlier that she was on medication,&#160;that will be baby friendly.&#160; "I won't be a fit mom" she said.&#160; I said "that's not true, sure you will".&#160; Then she started to holler "I hate kids, I hate kids".&#160; "No you don't" I said back to her.&#160; IA car went passed us &amp; honked at the graphic sign I was holding &amp; she said "yea that's right".&#160; I spoke to her until she went back into the parking lot &amp; got into the car, with her very quiet boyfriend, &amp; drove out.&#160; I hollered to her saying "we love you &amp; we need her in the world".&#160; I then for the first time saw a reaction of the boyfriend.&#160; This statement seemed to wake him up.&#160; Maybe because I put a gender to this 'disposable clump of tissue'.&#160; I only hope &amp; pray that she doesn't come back on Thursday to do the dirty deed.&#160; When I was talking to her,&#160;the miraculous picture of Our Lady of Guadelope, that we have on the sidewalk, was facing towards her.&#160; She is our Lady of conversion.&#160; She had to have looked at her Mother.&#160; </font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4" color="#000000"><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geuym6HopKUDoBkWRXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0N2hxODVzBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA0Y4MjJfMTE4/SIG=1ooc6vkvs/EXP=1250652218/**http%3a//images.search.yahoo.com/images/view%3fback=http%253A%252F%252Fsearch.yahoo.com%252Fsearch%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526p%253Dpictures%252Bof%252BOur%252BLady%252Bof%252BGuadelaupe%2526y%253DSearch%26w=379%26h=500%26imgurl=static.flickr.com%252F3207%252F2652278148_fd386a270c.jpg%26size=148.3kB%26name=2652278148%2bfd386a270c%2bjpg%26rcurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fletys3%252F2652278148%252F%26rurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fletys3%252F2652278148%252F%26p=our%2blady%2bguadalupe%26type=jpeg%26no=1%26tt=39%252C352%26oid=4e7c20789dceed30%26fusr=inspirational%26hurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Fletys3%252F%26tit=Our%2bLady%2bof%2bGuadalupe%26sigr=11fmdqhgg%26sigi=11gusg5ji%26sigb=12l3b8q2j%26sigh=114bjc7li" target="_self"><img width="65" height="86" src="http://thm-a01.yimg.com/image/4e7c20789dceed30" alt="static.flickr.com/3207/2652278148_fd386a270c.jpg" title="http://static.flickr.com/3207/2652278148_fd386a270c.jpg" style="width: 155px;

she said that she was going to have an abortion &amp; that was that.&#160; I said it was unnatural &amp; not normal to have your baby killed &amp; if you do, then you have crossed a line that you should never cross &amp;

I walked quickly to my car with a Truth packet &amp; a DVD &amp; hollered to Charles that I would be back soon &amp; to watch the radio that I had on the sidewalk.&#160; I made the light &amp; stopped her just before she hit Main St.&#160; I said to her that I had some information for her &amp; if she had a DVD player.&#160; She looked at me &amp; said just go away &amp; leave me alone &amp; walked to the corner of Main &amp; University.&#160; I stayed there for a few more seconds just so that she knew that I cared &amp; then drove back to my post under the tree in front of Planned Parenthood, to try to give the Truth to others.&#160; I hope &amp;

he said "that's horrible".&#160; I knew that&#160;he stopped the car&#160;to educate his daughter, that was with him.&#160; I offered him some information.&#160; He refused&#160;the offer&#160;initially then accepted all the literature that&#160;I could give him along with the plastic baby &amp; DVD.&#160; I thought that we were on the same wave length until he said "what if a girl has been raped then it's okay".&#160; Oh no, I'm going to have to deal with&#160;'kill the baby, that was conceived in rape, mentally'.&#160; I said "abortion is ALWAYS wrong under any circumstances &amp; that you don't kill the baby for the crime of the father &amp; that the mother will now be a murderer &amp; also a victim.&#160; She would be no better then the rapist but worse.&#160; At least with rape you're still alive but with abortion you are dead.&#160; It's false compassion to think that you are, helping the&#160;rape victim,&#160;by killing her child.&#160; Many rape survivors have been blessed by their children, who have helped them to heal, by their love.&#160; The daughter looked more convinced than the father did.&#160; I told them that I was a rape survivor &amp; that I conceived twins in that rape but lost them through a miscarriage &amp; I grieve still for my losses.&#160; I also told him that my sister was raped &amp; conceived &amp; that her daughter is 35 years old now &amp; has 2 children of her own.&#160; I only hope that I taught them to value ALL life.&#160; I also said that all life is precious &amp; should be protected, no matter how we were conceived.&#160; He said "thank you" &amp; drove away.&#160; I only can share the Truth to people &amp; my own personal life experiences.&#160; I just find it strange that so many people are playing God, to determine who lives &amp;

I was told that Planned Parenthood does the ultrasounds &amp; determines the way to kill the baby on Tuesdays &amp; that they kill the little babies on Thursdays.&#160; Both &amp; all days are so important to be out in front of this evil place.&#160; My stomach always&#160;hurts when I see her car there.&#160; Tucker had set up all the signs &amp; was now sitting on the sidewalk praying the Rosary.&#160; Martha &amp; I were standing on the sidewalk counseling &amp;

The Death Escort, Sylvia Rose was already there doing her evil by approaching the cars &amp; getting them in the Killing Mill, to ruin their lives by having their children killed.&#160; When she left, hours later, on the way out I called her a witch, which she is, for she works for the Evil One.&#160; This one person is responsible for the deaths of so many children, hundreds maybe even thousands, for she has been doing this for at least 10 years now.&#160; She was even bringing girls in at Abortionist Morris Wortman's Killing Mill, in Brighton, to have their babies be killed.&#160; She is one of many Death Escorts, Planned Parenthood uses to deceive the girls &amp; guys.&#160; Martha spoke to a older man who was walking down the street giving him a Rosary &amp; talking to&#160;him about what Planned Parenthood&#160;does. He said that he tried to talk to his daughter but the mother under minds him.&#160; I think that he said that she went on birth control, which is to bad.&#160; Another man walked down the sidewalk &amp; I offered him a Rosary &amp; he said "no, I don't pray to Mary I go directly to God".&#160;&#160; I said to him "you have a&#160;mother &amp; don't you ask your mother to intercede for you for different things".&#160; I said "that's how it is with Mary, who is the Mother of God, we ask her to go ask her Son Jesus, for a prayer request for us &amp; she does".&#160; The Lord is so happy to see His mother come into the Throne Room&#160;&amp;

called 911 on this"?&#160; Even if you didn't get the license # or a description you can call 911 &amp; report what you have seen &amp; experienced &amp; the direction of where the car&#160;was going.&#160;&#160;I then looked around to see that the woman who was ringing the&#160;doorbell was now in the hallway.&#160;

no we're not calling the police on you".&#160; Why should she even had thought that was strange.&#160; She then said "I think that I'm pregnant what should I do"? &#160;Oh no not this again!&#160; I said "you're not pregnant, you're to old to be pregnant".&#160; I said come on &amp; I'll give you a pregnancy test, in an frustrated voice.&#160; She said "I don't like your attitude &amp; I'm not pregnant"&#160; As she was leaving she slammed the front door &amp;

She was the one that was escorted into Planned Parenthood by Rick Bartel &amp; James Stewart.&#160; Well there she was sitting on the bench talking to the murderous staff member.&#160; She saw me &amp; came over.&#160; I was only hoping that she did not have an abortion.&#160; On Wednesday evening I had called people that I knew from Rescue Rochester &amp; that&#160;she said she knew also, for prayer support.&#160; I was still hoping that this was all a made up thing on her part &amp; it was not real.&#160; Talk about denial on my part.&#160; Mary S. had looked up her name, that I had asked her on Tuesday.&#160; She said that it was from the Bible.&#160; Mary S. had emailed me&#160;that it was from the book of Eziekel &amp; the definition of the name was "belonging to God'.&#160; Also, Mike form Rescue Rochester said if I see her again&#160;to give her his name &amp; phone number for her to call him&#160;anytime.&#160; When I saw her today &amp; said to her that I had 2 things for her, one was a phone # &amp; the other was a definition of her name.&#160; Then I noticed the plastic bracelet that she was wearing on her arm &amp; got sick to my stomach.&#160; I asked her if she had an abortion &amp; she said so causally "yes I did".&#160; Then she said "I saw the ultrasound picture on Tuesday &amp; the baby was waving at me but it was better for me to have it killed".&#160; I said "no it wasn't" &amp; walked away from the presence of evil for it is so disheartening.&#160; She was now talking to Martha &amp; the male prolifer.&#160; I walked over to her again &amp; heard so much nonsense.&#160; I said "please just go now &amp; I hope that you repent".&#160; She went bonkers.&#160; She started to say awful things in such a cold &amp; heartless way.&#160; I went to get some Holy Water &amp; Salt &amp; the Crucifix.&#160; When I returned she just blasphemed again &amp; again when I put the Holy Water &amp; Salt on the sidewalk &amp; showed her the Crucifix.&#160; It was the demons in her speaking.&#160; Martha was saying the Hal Mary prayer &amp; the St. Michael grayer.&#160; Then she said "I'm calling the police on you".&#160; "Go ahead", I said &amp; she reached into her purse &amp; got out a nasal spray &amp; put it up her nose.&#160; I then was praying in&#160; Tongues&#160;in the Holy Sprit.&#160; She said many unmentionable things that I dare not to repeat nor will I offend the dear Lord again.&#160; She finally left grumbling all the way into Planned Parenthood's parking lot.&#160; A few minutes later a car drove into the&#160;driveway with a male driver in it with his thumb up.&#160; Martha said to me "does that mean good for us or I agree with abortion".&#160; Well the later was what he was indicating.&#160; He was her boyfriend picking her up.&#160; As they were leaving she gave me a look that I can't even describe &amp; all I said to both of them was&#160;"may God have Mercy on your souls".&#160;This truly was a day from hell.&#160;

Martha gave her a plastic baby to take with her to show her friend.&#160; Planned Parenthood does 1st. trimester abortions &amp; refers for 2nd. trimester abortions.&#160; They were preparing her for a later abortion unless she changes her mind which we hope &amp;

One was "I only took a few wipes there was only a few left".&#160; I told her that I had just put a new box of wipes in the bathroom just a few minutes before I saw her &amp; invited her into the center on Saturday.&#160; First lie.&#160; Second lie "I didn't take anything from the cupboards".&#160; Oh yes you did&#160;, you were drinking a drink with a straw that wasn't what I gave you but was from the cupboard.&#160;

Then I asked the older woman, who was the mom of the pregnant girl &amp; the grandmother of the little girl, who stole my heart.&#160; She said that they went into Planned Parenthood for condoms.&#160; I said "what"!&#160; Then they landed a bomb on me.&#160; The young pregnant girl said that they were going to put the condoms in&#160;a dish &#160;for the 'Baby Shower' to promote 'safe sex'.&#160; Oh my Lord what next.&#160; Sometimes it's too much.&#160; I gave her more information &amp; asked her not to dishonor the Lord by doing this.&#160; She smiled at me &amp; said that she wouldn't.&#160; I hope that she keeps her promise.&#160;Abstinence is the only way to go, not&#160;'safe sex'.&#160; No such thing, just another lie.&#160; </font></strong></p><p align="left"><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">&#160;Martha was putting the signs away &amp; I stayed out on the sidewalk so no one would take anything.&#160; It was about 5:15PM.&#160; I saw the abortionist, Rachael Phelps get into her car &amp; decided to just stand there by the tree silently holding the Our Lady of Guadeloupe sign.&#160; I'll let Mother Mary speak to her &amp; not me.&#160; She stopped briefly &amp; looked over my head to see if it was safe for her to pull out &amp; then she drove away.&#160; It is so surreal to see someone, that close to you, knowing that she is a serial killer &amp; there is nothing you can do to stop her from killing more people.&#160; You can't call the police &amp; have her arrested, for killing people, for she has the law on her side in this country, even though she is killing American children for $$$$.&#160;

We then went over to the center to get ready to go on the street together.&#160; Bill had just come&#160;&amp; was placing the Holy Water on the sidewalks.&#160; We fight not against flesh &amp; blood but powers of the nether world.&#160; This is a Battle &amp; it is Spiritual&#160;Warfare.&#160; God is with us.&#160; The Death Escort was there helping women &amp; girls have their babies killed.&#160; I was hoping that after he saw Maafa 21 that he would never return, but I'm always wrong.&#160; He came walking from around the bushes &amp; gave his sympathy for the killing of Jim the prolifer who was shot down near of a school, showing the Truth through holding a graphic sign. Oh, how the pro deathers can be 'so nice', how strange.&#160; I told him that killing is killing &amp; that is what they are doing at Planned Parenthood &amp; that you are apart of it.&#160; He's really like, the man who killed Jim the prolifer, the only difference is that Barry Swan doesn't have a gun, he has a smile.<br /><br />
The crazy male worker at Planned Parenthood, that cares more about something touching the wood ledge, that surrounds the tall trees on the sidewalk, got out of his car &amp; walked over to us to see if we had anything touching the ledge.&#160; He cares more about this then them, at Planned Parenthood, killing babies.&#160; Please get your priorities straight Mr. Nutcase.<br /><br />
All of a sudden a nice man of God, for he had a collar on, came over to talk to Martha &amp; I.&#160; His name is Rev. Juan, &amp; he is a Lutheran Missionary.&#160; We talked to him for awhile on the sidewalk &amp; then I brought him into the&#160;center to meet Suzanne the counselor, who volunteers on Thursdays.&#160; It was&#160;quite a talk that we all had.&#160;He lost his sibling by abortion.&#160; The forgotten ones in this abortion evil. &#160;I then gave him as many pieces of literature &amp; 2 DVD's that I could for educational purposes to take with him so that he could help others.&#160; He wanted to take out picture but he had forgotten his camera phone.&#160; I was glad.<br /><br />
Two guys were walking a stroller with a 2 year old boy in it &amp; I invited <br />
them into the center for clothes &amp; toys for the boy.&#160; They walked out very&#160;happy, with a big stuffed animal, as they passed me by on the sidewalk. They also wanted a Rosary, which we tell people not necessarily to ware it but to pray it.<br /><br />
Suzanne gave 2 pregnancy tests &amp; counseled these clients.&#160; One of the <br />
clients came back to the Focus Center, for she was there about a month ago &amp; had a pregnancy test.&#160; She was pregnant now &amp; her step father said for her to "kill the baby".&#160; Her girlfriend told her that she could come live with her if her stepfather kicks her out of the house.&#160; Suzanne made arrangements for her to go to Compass Care Pregnancy Services, for an ultrasound &amp; the stepfather did take her &amp; I thank God that he had a change of heart.<br /><br />
Martha &amp; Bill had to go so I was now by myself on the sidewalk.&#160; A car drove passed me with a bunch of guys in it saying "are you kidding, get a life". &#160;A few minutes the same car was on the side where I was standing &amp; stopped right in front of me saying things I won't repeat.&#160; I never heard that before, &amp; I have heard a lot of things,&#160;how original you wimps.&#160; Why don't you guys&#160;get a life!&#160; I got out my cell phone &amp; said to them that I will call the police &amp; pretended to take a picture of the car &amp; it's license number.&#160; The only thing is that&#160;I don't have a camera phone.&#160; Fake out!!&#160; It works all the time.&#160; Off they went speeding down the street to no where land.<br /><br />
The cherry on to top of the sundae, was Jim Bovay, the crazy neighbor who lives comfortably across the street from Planned Parenthood for the last 14 years.&#160; How sad!&#160; His new thing is to just stand there, across the street, with his arms crossed &amp; stare at us.&#160; Oh I'm so afraid Jim boy.&#160; Well today&#160;I guess he saw me by myself &amp; thought "I'll get her now".&#160; Not now not ever Mr. Jim.&#160; God is protecting me.&#160; He said "oh Mary your sign is leaning against the tree, I'm going to call the police".&#160; I took out my phone &amp; said&#160;"I'm going to call the police on you for harassment".&#160; Then he said to me&#160;"can I use your phone"?&#160; I said "no Jim go get your own phone".&#160; I said that "the Federal Marshall's would probably arrest you for bothering them for&#160;nothing".&#160; I did say to him that he looked old to which he replied "we all are getting older".&#160; He hasn't been this close to me in so long that I guess I was surprised that he had so many wrinkles but no wisdom.&#160; A man getting older should have wrinkles &amp; wisdom.&#160; I knew that I could not reason with this man of no reason, so I started to pray.&#160; I said the Hail Mary &amp; the St.Michael prayer then the Our Father &amp; the Glory Be &amp; then I prayed in&#160;Tongues, then he finally went back across the street &amp; went back into his <br />
house. So long Jim!!&#160; Please don't come back again.&#160; He needs prayer.&#160; After 14 years hearing the Truth &amp; seeing the Truth &amp; living across the street&#160;from a Killing Mill &amp; not getting it by now, is soooo sad to my heart.&#160; It's called 'blindness' &amp; so the workers &amp; abortionist, at Planned Parenthood, also suffer from this condition.&#160; </font></font></strong><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><font size="4"><font color="#000000">There by the grace of God go I.</font></font></strong></p><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p>&#160;</p><p><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong><font color="#0000ff">Thursday Sept. 24, 2009 in front of Planned Parenthood</font><br /><br />
I arrived to 3 people out in front of Planned Parenthood praying during the '40 Days for Life'.&#160; I went over to speak to them &amp; Suzanne arrived our Thursday afternoon counselor.&#160; We went in the center to prepare for our 2PM appointment with Rae, from the Social Committee at St. Louis Parish for tithing money to help us at the Center.&#160; Melody arrived to help out at the Material Aid Room which was a blessing.&#160; Rae arrived at 2PM &amp; we had an excellent meeting to explain what we do at the Center.&#160; Madeline came into the Center to tell me that the Reporter form the Catholic Courier was outside taking pictures.&#160; I went to retrieved him to come into the center to look around at our expansion.&#160; We talked for a few minutes &amp; he took some pictures.&#160; I offered him a stuffed animal for his 3 year old son &amp; he spotted Bill the Builder doll for his son.&#160; He was happy. I told him about Pat &amp; her 4 grandchildren &amp; 2 great grandbabies.&#160; I told him that I will call Amy, the Catholic Courier reporter, to tell her the story &amp; hopefully she will interview Pat, the Grandmother, for the story to be published in the Catholic Courier in November.&#160; I said good bye to both Rae &amp; Mike, the photographer.&#160;&#160; I went outside to go back to the sidewalk &amp; got a call form the student Becky, at Elam College, to set up a time for 2 of the students to come to the Focus Pregnancy Help Center on Wednesdays from 4-7PM to help out &amp; gain some experience.&#160; When I got to the frontlines I heard someone&#160;say "hello" &amp; I&#160;turned around to see Anthony, who I haven't seen in such a&#160;long.&#160; I said "hi" Tony, it's good to see you.&#160; His&#160; baby was killed at Planned Parenthood by his girlfriend &amp; her mother &amp; he didn't know anything about it &amp; has suffered so much for what had happened to him. He is homeless &amp; has been in some trouble along the way.&#160; I brought him into the center to get him something to eat, he was appreciated.&#160; We went back outside &amp; he was sitting on the ledge, by the trees,&#160;when a car was coming out of the parking lot of Planned Parenthood, the young woman stuck her head out of the window screaming "I got rid of it , I just got rid of it".&#160; I screamed "Lord have mercy on your soul" as the car drove off.&#160; This hurt me &amp; I know that it hurt Anthony, who lost his precious baby at Planned Parenthood&#160;years earlier.&#160; He is so broken &amp; post abortive.&#160; I pray that we can get him some help to heal form his tremendous loss.</strong></font>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><strong><font size="6"><hr /></font></strong><p><strong><font size="5"><font color="#0000ff">September 30, 2009</font></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="5"><font color="#0000ff">HI EVERYONE,&#160; <br /><br />

A brave soul she is.&#160; I&#160;joined her &amp; then Jim arrived to pray.&#160; I asked if I could go into the center to do some things &amp; they said "yes" so I went into the center &amp; they stayed to pray on the sidewalk.&#160; I came out awhile later &amp; Jim had to go &amp; then Sue came, which was good.&#160; As I was walking back to the sidewalk I saw a woman smoking at the end of the sidewalk.&#160; I asked her if we could help her &amp; she replied that saying "I don't need the help, you do". I said back to her that "we are not the ones killing the babies but Planned Parenthood is &amp; you are believing a lie".&#160; She walked back to the door of the Killing Mill &amp; went back in.&#160; Later she came out with probably her daughter &amp; as they were pulling out of the driveway I said "shedding innocent blood" &amp; she gave my her finger out of the car window as she drove away to a life of hell.&#160; We can only pray for them &amp; give them to God to convert.<br /><br />
As a car was leaving the parking lot I spoke with her &amp; she stopped her car by the sidewalk.&#160; She said that she was pregnant &amp; I told her about the Focus Pregnancy Help Center &amp; she followed&#160; to the center.&#160; I gave her some more literature &amp; a doctors list because she was 'high risk'.&#160; I said that you don't deserve to be in a place that is so evil like Planned Parenthood, as a Christian, the 'Light of the World'.&#160; She agreed &amp; took the literature &amp; the 2 DVD's on Growth &amp; Development &amp; Maafa 21: Black Genocide in the 21st. Century.&#160; She went away happy &amp; I said for her to call me at any time &amp; to come back later on for baby clothes.&#160; She agreed.<br /><br />
As I was leaving to go back to the sidewalk the doorbell rang &amp; I went to answer the door to see our past clients coming back for more items.&#160; I had to say that we service our clients only twice &amp; they understood.&#160; She received many nice things for her children again.&#160; As they were leaving someone else was at the door with a beautiful child.&#160; She was the grandmother &amp; she was with a male friend.&#160; I noticed that the young child didn't have a car seat &amp; insisted that they get one.&#160; They said that they let the car seat out but it wasn't returned yet.&#160; I said that this child needs her car seat back for her to be safe in the car &amp; that if the police stops you, you will get ticket,&#160; they both agreed to get the car seat back. They came into the center to receive many nice clothes, shoes &amp; a lilac snow suit with a hat &amp; jacket.&#160;This little child will now both be warm &amp; toasty this winter. Thank God!<br /><br />
I then went back to the sidewalk to be with Sue.&#160; She knew that I needed to callout to the girls to offer them help &amp; to try to save their babies lives. If I don't call out then how would they know that we can help them &amp; what about their precious child?&#160; If I don't call out then they will die without anyone caring &amp; loving them &amp; trying to save their lives.&#160; I must call out to give them a chance to change their minds.<br /><br />
The Lord has showed me that we have 22 babies that were save by His grace. Praise God!!&#160; Please don't be silent that is what we have been doing for so long, for 37 years.&#160; Don't you think it's time to speak up!!!&#160; If not now then when?????&#160; Silence is acceptance &amp; why would you accept the murdering of little babies????&#160;&#160; God have mercy on you that are silent in this Holocaust.<br /><br />
Sue &amp; are were standing on the sidewalk &amp; I'm not kidding, that at least 8 cars that passed us by, ALL gave us a positive response, through a friendly honk or a positive hand gesture or a great big smile.&#160; One man even made the Sign of the Cross as he went passed the Killing Mill.&#160; How touching.&#160; Sue &amp; I were so happy to have experienced this rarity.<br /><br />
Sue said the 'Divine Mercy' prayer at 3PM for a friend of hers that is dying &amp; has not asked to receive the Last Rites or Confession or Holy Eucharist. We prayed that he will before he dies.<br /><br />
A nice woman stopped her car, as she was leaving. Planned Parenthood &amp; said that she didn't believe in abortion &amp; was pregnant.&#160; I gave her a literature packet &amp; a DVD on the Growth &amp; Development of her baby.&#160; She said "thank you" &amp; drove away.<br /><br />
A car drove into Planned Parenthood &amp; dropped a young girl off.&#160; The man stopped as he was leaving &amp; said that he was dropping his niece off here. We asked for what &amp; she said that he didn't know.&#160; We gave him a packet of information &amp; A DVD on Growth &amp; Development &amp; bloodless abortion procedure &amp; Carol Evert's talk about the abortion industry, which she was once involved in.&#160; It's a powerful DVD that we try to pass out to as many girls as we can. 'They Shall Know the Truth &amp; The Truth Shall Set Them Free'.&#160; We encouraged him to go back into Planned Parenthood to see why she was there &amp; if it was for an abortion to then get her out of there.&#160; We will help her in anything that she needed.&#160; He drove away.&#160; How sad.&#160; He might have innocent blood on his hands. God only knows.<br /><br />
A young passed us on the sidewalk &amp; we asked if we could help her.&#160; She said that she was going in there for testing, which means STD Testing.&#160; I gave her information to call Compass Care for Free STD Testing &amp; she said that it was far away.&#160; She took the information &amp; went into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I was sad but I had a feeling that she was going to come out real soon which she did.&#160; I then reminded her to call Compass Care where they really care about you not like Planned Parenthood.&#160; She smiled &amp; said "thank you" &amp; walked away.&#160; We felt sooo much better that she was out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; Amen.<br /><br />
A few minutes later a young girl &amp; guy were walking down the street.&#160; We offered them some information &amp; they stopped to talk to us.&#160; She said that she was going into Planned Parenthood for The Pill, that her mother told her to come there to get it.&#160; I gave her a brochure about The Pill &amp; how it works &amp; all the side affects to expect.&#160; Also that it can, at times, kill an embryo, which is your baby.&#160; I started to talk to the young man &amp; she said that he was her cousin not her boyfriend.&#160; I said "good".&#160; I told her to go back home to tell her mother that she was not going to have sex before marriage &amp; will not take a pill that was dangerous to her &amp; to her baby if she did engage in sex before marriage.&#160; To stand up to her mother in a respectful manner &amp; to be strong.&#160; 'Make today the first day of the rest of your life.'&#160;&#160; She smiled &amp; walked away, only to go into Planned Parenthood, but came out only after a few minutes.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; She &amp; her cousin walked up the street reading the literature.&#160; Yeah!!!!<br /><br />
A car stopped on the street &amp; said to us "what are you doing"&#160; I knew what he was up to, after many years of experience, &amp; he didn't disappoint me.&#160; I said "we are here to try to save lives form being killed by abortion".&#160; His reply was &amp; I will not repeat what he said, for I do not want to offend the dear Lord, or you who is reading this 'Front Line Weekly' page.&#160; I said back to him to "Repent".&#160; Another wounded person that was probably involved in an abortion.&#160; Ironically, the people that get mad at us don't know that we can truly help them to heal from their abortion involvement.&#160; How sad!!<br /><br />
We gave out more packets, to open minded people &amp; also Rosaries, to help people, to get closer to the Lord.<br /><br />
Sue had to go &amp; there was no one to replace her, so I decided to stay put for awhile, which I'm glad that I did.&#160; You never know what God has planned for you.&#160; A few minutes later a Black man came walking down the street &amp; I said to him "Planned Parenthood is killing off your race &amp; what are you doing to stop it".&#160; He looked at me with a surprise on his face.&#160; He said back to me "I'm having our baby".&#160; I said "that is very good &amp; I'm so happy to hear this".&#160; I then gave him the Truth packet &amp; both DVD's &amp; he said "thank you".&#160; I don't remember this ever happening to me in all the 14 years that I've been out on the Frontlines, but I could be wrong, he came over to me &amp; gave me a great big HUG. WOW.&#160; That was so nice of him.&#160; I said "thank&#160;you" &amp; he walked away.&#160; What a nice experience, for a change.</font></p></div><p>&#160;</p><strong><hr /></strong><p><font size="5" color="#ff0000"><strong>PLEASE GO TO 'FRONT LINE WEEKLY' # 6.&#160; </strong></font></p><p><font size="5" color="#ff0000"><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></font></p></font></font></div></div></div></div></div></font></font></div></font></div></div></div></div><div id="dnn_ctr438_HtmlModule_HtmlModule_lblContent" class="Normal"><p align="left">&#160;&lt;<a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=114&amp;tabid=123">Previous</a> | <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=146&amp;tabid=123">Next</a>&gt; Page</p><p align="center">&#160;<img width="83" height="86" src="http://ac4.yt-thm-a02.yimg.com/image/973b8a58337aa32a" alt="www.ourchurch-graphics.com/member/e/Echoesofthehear/The_Gift_of_Jesus_Designs_4_Him_03_07_03.jpg" title="http://www.ourchurch-graphics.com/member/e/Echoesofthehear/The_Gift_of_Jesus_Designs_4_Him_03_07_03.jpg" style="width: 171px; height: 137px;" /></p><p align="center">&#160;</p><hr /><p align="center"><font size="4">&#160;<strong><font color="#0000ff">Saturday, February 28, 2009 </font></strong></font></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="4" color="#0000ff">'Silent March for Life' on the&#160;streets of Rochester</font></strong></p><p align="center">&#160;</p><p align="left"><font color="#0000ff"><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">The Mass, at Our Lady of Victory at 12:10pm&#160;was beautiful &amp; Fr.

As we were going down Gibbs St. we turned the corner to get to the Killing Mill, Planned Parenthood &amp; there were about&#160;20 pro abortion people waiting for us.&#160; It must have been pretty awesome for them to see 100 people turn the corner.&#160; It was a sad sight to behold to see all these angry people hooping &amp; hollering&#160; &amp; chanting phrases like "keep your Rosaries off of my ovaries".&#160; Even the guys, with no ovaries, were saying&#160;this phrase.&#160;&#160;They are so indoctrinated by the females that have had an abortion &amp; have not repented yet.&#160; They didn't know what they were talking about.&#160; It was very sad.&#160; The pro lifers sang 'Amazing Grace" &amp; said the&#160; 'Hail Mary' prayer &amp; the 'Chaplet of Divine Mercy' &amp; the prayer to 'St. Michael', for protection from the Evil One.&#160; One of the young men was holding the crucifix from Our Lady of Victory Church &amp;&#160;he said "I'll stay here all night if I have to".&#160; What a sweet young man, great job Scott &amp; Mary.&#160; I spoke to&#160;the anti life side,&#160;at times,&#160;&amp; after about a&#160;1/2 hour&#160;later I went into the center to get out the graphic signs, of the babies that were murdered by abortion.&#160; As I was showing the signs 2 people, on the pro choice side,&#160;left pretty quickly.&#160; One of the girls, who was screaming with the pro abortion group, went to her car &amp; came out with a sign that read " I don't regret my abortion".&#160; It made my stomach sick, how very sad.&#160; But after awhile I think, through the grace of God, she mellowed.&#160; As the Marchers went into the Focus Pregnancy Help center to get warmed up &amp; to get fed one of the pro lifers &amp; I stayed a little while longer outside, to the dismay of the police, because they were very cold.&#160; The pro lifer invited them over to speak to us &amp; the girl with the sign came right over.&#160; The pro lifer had been holding a sign with a picture of a little child that read, below the picture, "Mommy please love me".&#160;&#160; So the first thing that she said was " I wouldn't kill a 5 year old".&#160; Then the pro lifer started to talk to her. The police wanted us to all go away, so the pro lifer &amp; the girl went across the street to talk.&#160; Then one of the guys came over to talk to me.&#160; He asked me some questions &amp; I answered them to the best of my ability.&#160; I then gave him the card with the Focus Pregnancy Help Center's information on it, plus the address to this web site, which I hope &amp; pray that he looks at.&#160; He touched my heart.&#160; The police wanted to go, so we had to go too.&#160; Also, a Truth packet was handed out to 4 of the pro abortion protesters, who happened to park in our parking lot.&#160; I know it was God's grace that they took the packet which had a lot of information in it.&#160; Yeah!!&#160; It was a good experience to engage with the pro abortion people &amp; hopefully, by the grace of God, that their eyes were opened to the Truth today &amp; that they get the help &amp; healing that&#160;God wants&#160;for them,&#160;from what they did in the past.

I was so happy to have met them.&#160;I notices a couple of young people sitting by the door of Planned Parenthood I called over to them that we could help them, it was a guy &amp; a girl.&#160; She said that they were there for&#160;STI testings &amp; that she was on the Pill.&#160; I told her&#160;about the abortion effects of the Pill &amp; that I had a&#160;packet of information that I wanted to give her.&#160;&#160;I&#160;then brought&#160;Father &amp; the 2 sisters &amp; the pro lifer into the center for them to look around.&#160; I quickly went &amp; got&#160;Truth packets&#160;&amp; ran back to PP to give them each a packet to get the help that they needed.&#160; They were receptive &amp; took the information. &#160;I ran back into the center.&#160; They all were looking around &amp; taking the literature that they needed for their ministry. &#160;The one sister told me that she was born at 7 months &amp; that the doctor wanted her mother to have an abortion because she was a signal mother&#160;with 3 other children.&#160; She said "no" &amp; the good sister was born.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; How some of the doctors want their patients to have their babies killed.&#160; And they call themselves doctors.&#160; Father was trying to fix the doorbell that isn't working &amp; determined that it need 3 new batteries.&#160; I said "thank you Father I will call the Landlord regarding this".&#160; He asked to go back to the street &amp; we did.&#160; There I met a woman with a child &amp; invited them in the center to get a stuffed animal for the young boy.&#160; He tool the donkey &amp; had a big smile on his cute little face.&#160; All were happy.&#160; I then went back to the sidewalk to be with Fr. &amp; the gang.&#160; As I arrived a young girl approached me &amp; asked if she could get a Pregnancy test.&#160; I said "yes, come &amp; follow me" &amp; I lead her to the center.&#160; After the test she received some clothes &amp; a stuffed animal for her 2 year old daughter &amp; Father &amp; the gang came back into the center.&#160; We all held hands &amp; Father said a prayer for us all.&#160; Our new client was smiling from ear to ear when she left &amp; was&#160;happy &amp; blessed.&#160; Everyone went back to the sidewalk again &amp; there were 2 other people sitting by the door to PP.&#160; I asked Father to call them over to him so that he could talk to them.&#160; He did &amp; the one young girl came over to him.&#160; He said "hi, how are you today".&#160; She replied back "horrible" &amp; he talked with her for awhile.&#160; He blessed her &amp; gave her hope where she had none until he called her over to speak to him.&#160; He also handed her a Truth packet.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; Please stay in Rochester I muttered.&#160; They had to go &amp; I was sad but blessed at the same time.&#160; I'll miss them all.&#160; Please come back again. </font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3" color="#000000"><img width="94" height="145" src="/Portals/0/new_pictures/414368856.jpg" alt="" style="width: 94px;

There were people praying &amp; Martha said, the day before, that she wasn't able to be there this afternoon.&#160; I was standing there, on the sidewalk, &amp;&#160;I turned to the parking lot, for I felt someone looking at me.&#160; There were 3 people in the car, one was an older woman, a young girl &amp; a&#160;young man were looking at me.&#160; I said to them "that we can help&#160;you" to which the young man said "lady, read your own sign", the sign I was holding was the graphic sign of the aborted baby that had the word 'choice' on the top.&#160; I was stunned&#160;&amp; I&#160;replied "this is what this 'choice' looks like".&#160; Then he said "we're all going to die" to which I replied "yes, we're all going to die but not all of usare going to&#160;be murdered".&#160; Then the woman must had told them to get out of the car, I think because she was loosing control of the situation, &amp; they all walked into Planned Parenthood.&#160; As they were walking in &amp; I was sick to my stomach I pleaded to the older woman not to have her Grandchild murdered here today.&#160; Made no difference, they all&#160;went in anyways.&#160; I was heart broken.&#160; It started to rain, the Lord's tears coming down from Heaven for all the killing of his children.&#160; How sad.&#160; I then turned around &amp; I saw Pat, the Grandmother of the Granddaughter who was heading for an abortion 2 weeks ago that was saved.&#160; It was so good to see her.&#160; I brought her to the center to speak to the counselor who was there.&#160; I introduced them to each other &amp; went back to the sidewalk to counsel some more.&#160; I was there trying to talk others from having their baby killed.&#160; I turned around only to see Martha standing there.&#160; What a surprise!&#160; What a relief!!&#160; She is such a good counselor &amp; I was so tired so she took over for me.&#160; I went back into the center to talk to the Pat &amp; the counselor &amp; invited Pat to give her testimony at the Pastor Robinson event on Friday, she said "yes she would".&#160; Praise God!!&#160; I also asked her to be at the meeting on Tuesday at Focus at 6PM.&#160; She said "yes".&#160; I was happy to hear this.&#160; She left &amp; I went back to the sidewalk to be with Martha.&#160; As I was gone for 15 minutes Martha told me that a man in a suit walked around the PP building with what appeared to be Holy Water &amp; sprinkled it everywhere.&#160; When he got to the door the Death Escort was trying to get out of the door &amp; he held it closed so she couldn't &amp; he prayed &amp;&#160;then walked away.&#160; I asked if she got his name &amp; she said that she didn't.&#160; So whoever you are THANK YOU &amp; GOD BLESS YOU &amp;

We talked to other people going into the Mill &amp; was offering them help.&#160; One man who was on a bicycle stopped to talk to us &amp; said that he didn't think to much about abortion until he came to Jesus.&#160;

me for&#160;I'm already stressed out".&#160; I hollered back "you wouldn't be stressed out if you weren't here killing your baby".&#160; He went back inside.&#160; About an hour later they all came out.&#160; I told them that I had named their son Jacob &amp; that he shouldn't have died here today.&#160; As they were driving out they gave me the finger.&#160; I hollered to them to repent of their serious sin for there was a Hell.&#160;

In her own words:</font>&#160; </font></strong></p></div><p><font color="#000000"><strong><font size="3">I've been at Planned Parenthood every Thursday from noon to 1:00.<br />
It's been quite interesting.&#160; There seems to be lots of activity there, with young women leaving the building, people going out to lunch, and lunch-time traffic.<br />
I hold the "Pray to End Abortion" sign and wave, and I get lots of waves back, and thumbs-up, and beeps from the Pro-Life people, but I have also gotten the infamous finger, hex sign, and thumbs-down. It's very interesting.<br /><br />
A few weeks ago, one woman was leaving PP with 3 very young (high-school age?) women in her car, and I'm holding the sign and waving a packet that Mary gave me, saying, "take this, it will help you..."&#160; (I know I can't cross the line.) One of the young ones in the back seat&#160; gave me the finger, and the driver opened the passenger window and said, "Are you Christian?" To which I answered, "Yes" (God help me, I hope I never, ever deny Him!) Then she responds, saying, people shouldn't be pushing their beliefs on other people.&#160; I'm not good at quick responses, so I just said, well, most people don't kill their unborn children (or something like that).&#160; It's a waste of breath, though, isn't it.<br /><br />
Another time, two black men walked by on the sidewalk, about 15 minutes apart. One said, "God bless you!"&#160; The other said, "So if I get you knocked-up, you gonna have the baby?"&#160; I didn't realize what he said to me until a second later, so my initial response was "What?"&#160; And he didn't bother to repeat it. (I am in my fifties -- that's probably why what he said didn't click with me at first!)<br /><br />
Last week, a black man driving by stopped and called me a Republican and said that Bush is using us to blah-blah-blah. He also rambled on about how Bush was covertly using black children in slavery or some nonsense.&#160; I listened a bit, then just talked over him and said, so the answer is to kill the unborn children?&#160; He gave up and drove on, so I said, "God bless you! I will pray for you!"<br /><br />
Last Thursday, we seemed to get more positive responses, than negative.&#160; One driver took a picture of Bill as he drove by.<br /><br />
I think my guardian Angel is there with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><br />
It's funny how the pro-choice people tend to violent responses.&#160; That's why I always smile and wave.&#160; I don't hate the pro-choice people or the people who work there; I just hope that maybe they will think about it again and change their heart.&#160; Whereas, I think the pro-choice people hate the messenger, as well as the message.<br /><br />
Bill told me never to go to PP alone, and so far, I have been blessed with someone (mostly Bill) always being there, and good weather (although one week I was freezing, but was happy to offer it up--at least it wasn't snowing).</font></strong><br /><br /></font></p><hr /><p><strong><font size="4">Monday, March 30th. 2009</font></strong></p><div><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>Dear Friends,</strong></font></div><div><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>&#160;</strong></font></div><div><font size="4" color="#000000"><strong>What a Birthday present I received from the Lord today.&#160;

I asked her how old her precious baby was &amp; she told me he was 3 months old &amp; his name was Lawrence.&#160; As&#160;the granddaughter&#160;went to see the nurse I stayed to ask the young mother if she had ever visited the Focus Pregnancy Help Center, to which she replied that she had.&#160;&#160;She said that she was abortion minded when she saw me.&#160;She decided to 'choose life' &amp; look what the dear Lord gave her,&#160;a bundle of joy that she is now holding.&#160; She was so happy &amp; will be a great mom.&#160; I gave her our card with my phone&#160;number on it to call me&#160;to set up a time to stop by the center to get some baby clothes for Lawrence &amp; also to bring a picture of him when she comes, if she could.&#160; She said "yes she would".&#160; I only hope so.&#160; You never know when the dear Lord is going to bless you.&#160; Thank you Jesus for this mother &amp;

She assisted this couple because I had taken a woman who was coming out of Planned Parenthood, walking unstable, about 10 minutes earlier, I took her by the hand &amp; lead her out center to speak to our counselor to get assistance.&#160;

I was worried that she would not make it to her home safely so I told Martha that I would be back as soon as I could because I was going to take this woman home.&#160; I ran to my car &amp; went up the street to ask the woman where she lived &amp; to get into the car, which she did.&#160; I took her home which was off of Joseph Ave.&#160; I felt better that she was home safe &amp; sound.&#160; I put her information, which she received from the center, into a bag &amp;

that is if all you pro lifers would adopt the unwanted babies there would no more abortion problem anymore".&#160; I replied back to him that "if all the babies are killed by abortion how can all us pro lifers adopt them"?&#160; He quickly rode his bike away speeding down the street.&#160; I guess he tried but failed miserable at that one.&#160; Now if the mothers wouldn't have their babies killed by abortion &amp; didn't want them then there would be babies to adopt but first they have to be born.&#160;

I said to her that I could give her our packet of information which she said "no" to.&#160; I said "you need help" &amp; she said back "no I don't".&#160; I hollered to her, for she walking again walking away from me, Project Rachel.

They did it to block us from the girls &amp; them from us.&#160; It must be getting to them that we are affecting their blood business.&#160; I have a stool &amp; plan to stand on it to speak to the girls going&#160;into the Killing Mill.&#160; Also, I plan to have someone on the other side that is right in front of Planned Parenthood, this is a better view of the parking lot.&#160; We can still direct people into the Focus center so that they can get free pregnancy tests &amp; baby clothes &amp; referrals &amp; good counseling for a change in their lives.&#160; We still can save lives maybe even more with this new strategy.&#160; Praise God!!&#160; The neighbor across the street looked at me &amp; grinned when he saw that I had seen the change.&#160;He needs so much prayer against the evil that&#160;runs his life. &#160;Maybe we will go on&#160;his side of the street again.&#160; Remember we were there for 2 &amp; a 1/2 years after the Federal Court decision, by Judge Acara back in 1999.&#160; We then won our place to be across the street where we are now on appeal.&#160; Don't try to mess with God for He will win every time.&#160; How desperate they are at Planned Parenthood to murder babies &amp; to&#160;mess up&#160;woman's &amp; girl's&#160;lives, &amp; men's&#160; too.&#160;&#160;I called the policeman who took the report on Wednesday when the PP worker came up &amp; over the curb, with her car, towards Martha &amp; I.&#160; He said that the Sergeant went to speak to PP the following&#160;day. &#160;I don't know what he said but I'm sure that he did a good job.&#160; I also found out that she told the police officer, on Wednesday,&#160;that her car brushed against the curb.&#160; If you can work in a place that murders babies then you can also LIE.&#160; She came up &amp; over the curb at us with her bright blue car.&#160; I have kept her in my prayers &amp; so has Martha for her conversion, salvation &amp; repentance &amp; for a new job.&#160; I have forgiven her for what she did,that is required of me as a Christain.&#160; I hope that she thinks about what she did &amp; why.&#160; Lord please change her heart &amp; mind&#160;&amp; all that are at Planned Parenthood, especially the abortionist Rachel Phelps &amp; Nancy Stanwood &amp; all the abortionist in the world.&#160; Amen.&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3"><img width="130" height="97" src="/Portals/0/2274622826.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p></div></div><p>&#160;</p><div><hr /></div><div><br /><strong><font size="3"><font color="#0000ff">Tuesday, April 28, 2009 in front of Planned Parenthood</font></font></strong></div><p>&#160;</p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3"><img width="300" height="200" src="/Portals/0/protest_pics/080307_lead_today.jpg" alt="" style="width: 167px;

There were 2 pro lifer &amp; I.&#160; The strategy is to be on all sides of Planned Parenthood if there are enough people.&#160; One or two persons on the one side of the street by the trees &amp; the building side &amp; one or two persons across the street right in front of the driveway.&#160; This is were we were for 2 &amp; a 1/2 years until we won on appeal which brought us over to were we are now, on the side of Planned Parenthood.&#160;Since that planted the trees right in front of where we stand to counsel I thought of another strategy which covers us on all sides of the building.&#160; I was calling out to the girls &amp; a couple got mouthy but what do you expect when there are at Planned Parenthood &amp; probably living an immoral life.&#160; A car drove in with 2 young girls with the driver screaming "I want an abortion, are they doing them today".&#160; How sick!!&#160; Then pulled right out again &amp; stopped the car &amp; the driver was screaming at the other pro lifer about Hell.&#160; I said something to them &amp; the driver told me to "shut up you.....".&#160;I then realized that these were the 2 girls, that another pro lifer had told me about regarding yesterdays&#160;incident.&#160; Apparently the pro lifer, who was with me today, was on the sidewalk yesterday when they had stopped the car &amp; hollered out that she didn't regret her abortion. The pro lifer said to her "how old would your child be right now"&#160; &amp; the other pro lifer said to her "hell is forever".&#160; They came back &amp; saw her again &amp; screamed at her.&#160; As they drove away I said that what they did was "evil".&#160; I hope that we don't see them again only if they want help to get help to recover.&#160;&#160; I got to talk to a young girl walking into Planned Parenthood &amp; gave her a Truth packet &amp; asked her not to let them take it in there.&#160; She said the "they won't".&#160; I told her to be careful &amp; that we were right next door to help her if she need us. She said "okay".&#160; I told her about the list of doctors that we had in the packet.&#160; She was nice &amp; hope &amp; pray that she won't go back to this Killing Mill for anything.&#160; A car dove into PP &amp; looked at our signs &amp; drove right out again &amp; took 2 Truth packets on the way out.&#160; Praise God!!<br /></strong></font></p><p>&#160;<font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>It was now 4:30PM &amp; I was in the center getting ready for the meeting at 6:30 PM.&#160; Martha came in around 5:30PM to help me out when the door bell rang.&#160; There were 4 people coming into the center.&#160; Thank God Martha had just arrived to help me set up for the meeting.&#160; Martha gave the pregnancy test for the client to do &amp; we all went into the center to talk &amp; for them to receive more literature.&#160; They all were very pro life &amp; want to help us out on the street with their presence &amp; prayers.&#160; I hope so.<br /><br />

She said " I wish that you were there when I went for my abortion, do you think that God will forgive me"?&#160; I said to her "did you ask God to forgive you".&#160; She said "yes".&#160; I then said "then He did".&#160; She took a Truth packet &amp; also her friend who was driving too a packet also.&#160; She said that she was going to the cemetery to place the Rosary on her daughter's grave, that I gave her.&#160; She died from natural causes &amp; not by abortion.&#160; The little babies that are killed by abortion are not buried at a cemetery but are but in incinerators.&#160; No burial for them just thrown into the fire. &#160; A van came over to me which just left PP &amp; the driver said to me "what about the free pregnancy tests".&#160; I said "please follow me to the center" which they did.&#160; I opened the door &amp; was greeted by our counselor who took the young couple into the center for a pregnancy test while I stayed outside to speak the woman driver.&#160; She said that the young man who was in the center with his girlfriend was her son &amp; if she is pregnant they will keep the baby &amp; not abort it.&#160; I said "thank God".&#160; She then said to me that she knew nothing of her daughter's 3 past abortions &amp; was heart sick when she found out &amp; told her if she ever gets pregnant again she was not to do that again but to continue her pregnancy.&#160; I went back into the center to get more literature for the grandmother &amp; her daughter for her past abortions to heal with God's help.&#160; The pregnancy test was negative &amp; the young people were taught about abstinence &amp; was given a Truth packet., by the counselor. &#160;I then went back to the sidewalk&#160;to witness &amp;

to pray with us instead.&#160; The Lord does provide.&#160; Just then a young girl was dropped off by an elderly man &amp; he then drove away.&#160; I offered her a Truth packet &amp; told her about Planned Parenthood.&#160; She said that she really didn't want to go in but need a doctor to go to.&#160; I said that we had doctors on our list &amp; she came over to me on the other side of the street.&#160; I showed her the doctor list &amp; she was happy.&#160; I said "do you want to call him back to pick you up" &amp; she said that she would walk home.&#160; I then hollered across the street to the pro lifer if she could bring the girl home &amp;

Go Tucker go!!&#160; Very rarely I get some one to defend me so this went down real well for me &amp; it felt good.&#160; The kid mouthed off to Tucker &amp; then rode away down the street to wherever.&#160;

She drove away but at least she saw &amp; heard.&#160; I believe that the majority of the women working at Planned Parenthood are post abortive.&#160; 'Birds of a feather flock together'.&#160; And "misery loves company'.&#160;

Someone let out a&#160;<strong>bizarre</strong> scream &amp; I got the usual 'birdie gestures'.&#160;&#160;Probably all post abortive.&#160; Remember that 1/2 of the women in this county have had an abortion, even 2 or 3.&#160;

a doctor &amp; by 3 guys back when I was 18 &amp; the 3 rapisits. &#160;What about rape, she asked?&#160; I said that I am a gang rape survivor&#160;who conceived twins, from the rape,&#160;that I miscarried, which saddened my heart.&#160; How can you not love your own children no matter how they were conceived.&#160; As if we were all conceived in love &amp; that shouldn't make us vulnerable to be killed. &#160;She also said that she had been a rape survivor, which I said that I was sorry to hear.&#160; I said that a child shouldn't die for the crime of the father.&#160; If your father robbed a bank should you be killed for the crime he committed or should he go to jail &amp; you live.&#160; I feel so sorry for the babies&#160;conceived in rape babies for&#160;most people think that they should be killed.&#160;

she was very nice.&#160; She believed in life &amp; not in abortion, I guess she was just testing me.&#160; Her husband finally came to pick her up.&#160; I'll always remember her.&#160; Then Janet, our counselor, was leaving &amp; I said good bye to her &amp; thanked her for a great job tonight.&#160; Martha &amp; I went into the center to do some work.&#160; Thank God for all the people who&#160;make this ministry possible.&#160;

He was there for about&#160;20 minutes when Cleveland, our street person &amp; friend,&#160;came walking down the street with his worn out shoes that Martha bought&#160;him&#160;only a couple of months ago.&#160; He walks a lot during the day &amp; he wore out his new shoes.&#160; Ken, our new prayer warrior,&#160;was nice enough to have bought Cleveland some new white sneakers to wear.&#160; They fit &amp; Cleveland was&#160;very happy with his new shoes.&#160;</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">&#160;<img width="125" height="93" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/3368675635.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p></div><p><strong><font size="3">Then the Hell began.&#160; A young man with a cigarette came over to me onto sidewalk saying that he a question for me.&#160; I knew what he was going to say &amp; I was right.&#160; "What if the girl is 14 &amp; was raped by a older man &amp; she is pregnant".&#160; I said that the baby should not die for the crime of the father &amp; that rape is something that she can heal from but if she has an abortion that will stay with her the rest of her life.&#160; There is adoption &amp; love &amp; support in the community.&#160; The adult will be held more accountable then the 14 year&#160;old girl.&#160; I said "are you going to be there when she is crying at 3 in the morning &amp; if she attempts to take her life &amp; if she goes into a deep depression"?&#160; He couldn't answer me.&#160; I said "no real doctor would ever do abortions".&#160; Then he said that he was a Doctor, then he said a Medical Student.&#160; I said you are sure starting off wrong &amp; won't go anywhere if you believe in killing children.&#160; I told him that I was a gang rape survivor with a pregnancy, from the rape,&#160;that ended&#160;in a miscarriage.&#160; That doesn't matter because they look at it as 'you don't have the kid'.&#160; How sick &amp; sad this society has become.&#160; A throw away society we live in.&#160; I grieve my pregnancy loss &amp; I wasn't responsible for&#160;my twins death, imagine if I was.&#160; I mentioned Adoption, which again means having the baby.&#160; They want the baby dead &amp; that's that!&#160; I said that Planned Parenthood doesn't report statutory rape.&#160; That doesn't matter to these people either.&#160; They want the baby dead!&#160; I told him that she would probably hate him someday for taking her here, to have her baby be murdered &amp; that he was also responsible for this baby's death.&#160; I told him that I named this precious baby, that he allowed to be killed&#160;here at Planned Parenthood,&#160;Rebecca.&#160; Lord have mercy on his soul.&#160; I hope that he will quite Medical School, we already have to many doctors that kill&#160;&amp; not heal.&#160; I don't call them doctors, I call them abortionists, because doctors don't kill their patients children but abortionists do.&#160; Their lives will never be the same again.&#160; </font></strong></p><p align="left"><strong><font size="3">A car drove up to the curb &amp; a young man said to me "I would like a packet, for my girlfriend wants an abortion &amp; I don't want her to".&#160; I said&#160;"do you have a few minutes to come to the pregnancy center, next to this big yellow building with me, to get more information.&#160; He then said she's in the back right now.&#160; I looked in the back seat of the car which was empty &amp; then it dawned on me that he was referring that she was in Planned Parenthood in the back room to have an abortion right now.&#160; I said here is the packet, show her the growth &amp; development pictures of the baby&#160;&amp; get in their &amp; save your baby.&#160; He took the packet &amp; drove into the parking lot&#160;&amp; went into the evil place.&#160; He was there a long time which didn't make me feel that the baby was saved &amp; that he spent his time with the so called girlfriend after the abortion.&#160; Hopefully I'm&#160;wrong.&#160;

Here, &amp; I pointed to Planned Parenthood, is where the children ARE being aborted".&#160; He went nuts.&#160; He was screaming like someone just cut his leg off.&#160; The pain for him was that great.&#160; I said "if you are responsible&#160;for having a child killed by abortion please repent".&#160; He gave me the bird.&#160; Just then I heard a man's voice from behind me telling the guy to get lost.&#160;The car drove off. &#160;I turned around thinking it was our new prayer warrior, which it wasn't, he was a stranger.&#160; I said to him " you are&#160;an angel sent from God'.&#160; I said who are you?&#160; He said "I agree with what you are doing".&#160;&#160;Then He said&#160;"&#160;I'm walking back to work down the street".&#160; "Don't argue with people like that" he said.&#160; I said "he probably was involved in an abortion &amp; went ballistic when he saw the graphic sign".&#160; He said that his sister, when she was 17, she's now 68, had an abortion &amp; she couldn't have anymore children after that.&#160; I said "did she ask God to forgive her"?&#160; He said "yes".&#160; I mentioned Project Rachel &amp; Rachel's Vineyard &amp; he said that she's worked it through the church.&#160;

put her hands to her face &amp; started to cry.&#160; I said to her friend, who was now holding her "did she have an abortion"?&#160; The girlfriend said "no".&#160; I said "thank God, a girl with a heart".&#160; I said to her that I usually don't see this reaction&#160;when seeing the picture of the aborted baby &amp; that she had touched my heart with her caring in what this poor baby went through.&#160; She is 'special'.&#160; I told her that I wish everyone reacted this way.&#160; God bless you dear heart.&#160; As the cars were driving by on the street I said to them that "Planned Parenthood was killing Americans in there" or that "PP was murdering babies in there".&#160; People need to know about the horrors of Planned Parenthood evil agenda.&#160; A girl was driving out &amp; said "you don't need to make them feel bad in there"&#160; I said "just think know bad the babies feel as they are being ripped apart by abortion".&#160;

As I was driving into the parking lot I saw a young girl walking down the sidewalk &amp; stopped to speak to her.&#160; I invited her to come to see the pregnancy center, which she did.&#160; We talked &amp; I gave her a Truth packet &amp; more information &amp; told her the evils of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She listened.&#160; She said that she wasn't sexually active&#160;&amp; didn't believe in abortion.&#160;

I said "yes".&#160; She said "we'll be right over".&#160;&#160; They all came into the center.&#160; I asked if she was going to have a boy or a girl &amp; she said a "girl".&#160; I was happy because we have so many girl clothes.&#160;

She said "that would be great, maybe next week".&#160; I told her that I would be out there on Tuesday afternoon.&#160; Then she said that&#160;her friend at age&#160;17 got pregnant &amp; wanted the baby but her boyfriend &amp; his family surrounded her &amp; forced her to have an abortion.&#160; She was a Born again Christian.&#160; She is now suffering with what she did to the Lord &amp; her baby.&#160; I mentioned Project Rachel to her to give to her friend.&#160; This young girl I was talking to had the most beautiful colored ocean green eyes &amp; her name is Courtney.&#160; I said again "thank you for forgiving me &amp; I'll keep you &amp; your friend in my prayers &amp; I hope to see you again soon".&#160; As we were still talking the rain picked up &amp; I got soaked from my wait down to my feet because the wind was blowing towards me.&#160;&#160;Just then a car beeped at me,&#160;it was Martha riding&#160;down the street towards Planned Parenthood, to counsel.&#160; I&#160;waved back&#160;to her.&#160; I said good bye to Courtney&#160;&amp; I went to go back to the prayer team.&#160; I was soaked &amp; I remembered that I had brought an extra blouse &amp; socks but no extra pants, what was I thinking of!&#160; I got to the&#160;center &amp; used the blow dryer, to try to dry&#160;my pants, but they were to&#160;soaked.&#160; I new that Martha, who counsels &amp; the prayer people were out there to witness to the girls, so I was at peace to know that they were trying to save the babies from being aborted, while I was in the center drying my pants because I was to stupid to bring an extra pairwith me.&#160; It could rain in Rochester at any time always be prepared!!&#160; I will next time.&#160; I went back outside with wet pants &amp; then Martha came over to me &amp; said "would you like to wear these &amp; handed me a pair of black pants".&#160; I said "I sure would" &amp; asked her where she got them.&#160; She said that she had an extra pair in the car.&#160; Thank you Lord for you do provide.&#160; I went back into the center to put the dry pants on &amp; thanked God that they fit &amp;&#160;then back on the sidewalk.&#160; I felt like a chicken with it's head off.&#160;</font></strong></div><div><p align="center"><strong><font size="3"><img width="97" height="130" src="/Portals/0/2920911312.jpg" alt="" /></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size="3">I asked Father Jacob if he would give us all a blessing which he did.&#160;

Debbie now came to pray &amp; David had left.&#160; Paul was there with a chicken sandwich that he bought for me at Wendy's.&#160; I quickly went back into the center to wolf it down.&#160; Thanks Paul for lunch.&#160; Jerry &amp; Charles were praying there too.&#160; The cars went in &amp; babies were killed this day despite our efforts to change the mothers mind.&#160; At least the babies (human beings) knew that someone loved them before they were killed by Rachel Phelps the abortionist at Planned Parenthood.&#160;

I was glad that she had given her the DVD.&#160; I then gave Carol another DVD for the next person who will come her way who will need it.&#160; Carol is so cool, she waves to the cars passing her by, on the street &amp; the cars coming out of Planned Parenthood.&#160; She is so friendly that you want to approach her to talk to her.&#160; Another personal approach to the ministry.&#160; After Carol left I let Maria into the center for she was nice enough to take over the counseling duties for Suzanne who went to visit her family in Florida.&#160; I was so happy to have someone in the center &amp; Maria knows how to counsel for she was our first counselor a couple years ago.&#160;&#160;She has started 'Saif House' for mothers in need.&#160; I spoke with her for a short time &amp; went back to the sidewalk with signs &amp; the mega phone &amp; literature packets.&#160; Just then a woman turned the corner onto the sidewalk where I was standing,&#160;from the PP parking lot.&#160; &#160;She said to me "you remember me don't you".&#160; I said "yes".&#160; Then she said that she needed some things in the center &amp; I walked with her to the center to see Maria.&#160; She then said to me "my mother still works at Planned Parenthood but she is trying to get another job".&#160; "Sure" I said.&#160; Some people just like to stay in their rut.&#160; Change scares some people, maybe working in a killing mill doesn't scare her enough.&#160; I'm growing more cynical with time.&#160;Maria remembered this young lady &amp; I left to go back to the sidewalk again.&#160; There was Bill Smith&#160;&amp; I &amp; was waiting for more people to arrive, which they all came later.&#160; Paul came with a chicken sandwich &amp; an ice tea from Wendy's for me.&#160; Thanks Paul for being so thoughtful.&#160; David&#160;had come now to pray with Paul.&#160; I spotted 3 young girls with a baby in a stroller coming down the street towards Planned Parenthood &amp; I went to them to offer them some help.&#160; I brought them to the center for baby clothes &amp; a pregnancy test.&#160; The one girl was already pregnant &amp; she need some literature &amp; support.&#160; Maria was still talking to the young lady that I brought in&#160;a little while&#160;ago &amp; she left saying that she was going to come back to get her things for she had to go to court.&#160; I said "okay, I'll be here until about 7PM tonight &amp; I'll see you later".&#160; Then Maria was busy with our 3 clients &amp; the baby in the stroller.&#160; Just then Martha showed up &amp; I asked her if she would assist Maria with the 3 clients &amp; the cute baby in the stroller.&#160; She said that she would, so back to the sidewalk I go.&#160; I spoke with some girls &amp; gave away some Truth packets to those who wanted them.&#160; Paul &amp; David are pro active when it comes to offering the packets to the people.&#160; Great team work.&#160; Martha came back to the sidewalk &amp; then I went back into the center for another sign.&#160; I popped my head into the center to see how Maria was doing.&#160; The little baby was given some baby clothes &amp; a pregnancy test was administered by the client &amp; some literature was given to the pregnant girl.&#160; They all left &amp; went&#160;back to their home &amp; not to Planned Parenthood.&#160; For they were given the Truth &amp; no baby was scheduled to be killed at our center.&#160; I answered some questions for Maria &amp; she finished the paper work &amp; to the sidewalk I went.&#160; Debbie &amp; Jerry &amp; Charles &amp; Bill were now there praying &amp; witnessing.&#160; Charles brought me a banana &amp; a desert from McDonnell's.&#160; I get well fed by my friends.&#160; Martha was on the brick side of Planned Parenthood with mega phone speaking the Truth to the people going into the Killing Mill.&#160; I stood by the side where all the new trees were planted to block our vision.&#160; Just then a car pulled into the parking lot with a mother &amp; daughter.&#160; I spoke to them pleading to them not to have their baby killed.&#160; No reaction by them.&#160; I felt sick knowing, in my heart, that they were here to have their baby killed.&#160; It's so evil this place.&#160; Martha was speaking pretty much non stop with the mega phone to inform the people that we can help them.&#160; she was tired so she came back to the side where I was standing then out of no where a angry woman came over to us &amp; started screaming "you're going to hell, you're going to hell".&#160; "you're judging &amp; making these girls feel guilty".&#160; I said "if you're doing something wrong then you should feel guilty &amp; that killing is worse then judging &amp; that we weren't judging anyone's souls but their actions. "You should&#160; judge wisely".&#160; "How you judge is how you will be judged".&#160; She just went on to scream some more.&#160; Then she said "who's going to take care of the baby" then Martha said "I will".&#160; She just screamed some more ranting &amp; raving.&#160; Paul came up to her with the picture of the aborted baby &amp; said that "this is abortion &amp; my sister had one &amp; her life has never been the same since".&#160; Then she said "where's your sister now"?&#160; Paul replied "at work".&#160; Why did she want to know? &#160;She&#160;just went on &amp; on then went back into Planned Parenthood.&#160; I turned around &amp; there was a client that said that she was coming to talk to me, at the center.&#160; Maria had gone earlier, so we walked into the center to talk.&#160; We talked for awhile &amp; then she took some baby clothes for her 2 year old, she's expecting her 4th. baby in July.&#160; We said good bye &amp; then I went back to the sidewalk.&#160; When I arrived back to where the team was, Martha told me that the screaming woman came back &amp; took a packet &amp; threw it down the sewer.&#160; How nice of her.&#160; She also bumped into Martha saying that Martha bumped into her &amp; that she was going to call the police.&#160; Debbie was a witness of this 'set up'&#160;for some reason the 2 guys didn't see it happening.&#160; I said if she comes back we shouldn't talk to her for she&#160;was dangerous &amp; guilty of sin.&#160;She also blew cigarette smoke in Martha's face &amp; threw a cigarette butt at me. &#160;Nice lady. Then Debbie had to leave &amp; she was going to her car when a police car drove passed us &amp; waved at us.&#160; The car stopped down the street &amp; parked there.&#160; I went up to Debbie &amp; asked her if she could wait for a few minutes &amp; she said "yes".&#160; Just then the police car drove away.&#160; I said "she didn't call the police &amp; thanks Debbie for staying".&#160; Off she went.&#160; Then Martha left too.&#160; Martha had told her earlier&#160;that if she did call the police that she was going to tell them that she blocked the sewer with paper.&#160; Good thinking Martha.&#160; She didn't come back to the sidewalk again&#160;but when she left, with the young girl in the car, she left the parking still screaming.&#160; Lord have mercy on her soul if she took part in having a baby killed here today.&#160;

that I am trying to avoid going to hell by God's mercy.&#160; Then as they were walking towards the back parking lot the man took down his pants &amp; mooned me.&#160; I told him that I was going to call the police, which I did.&#160; Two police cam one in a car &amp; the other officer, on a bike.&#160; I told them what had happened &amp; they went into PP &amp; talked to the man.&#160; He said that he just pulled on his belt &amp;

Yes officer, if that's how you deal with this crime then I feel sorry for you.&#160; He was a nice officer but a bit confused, like most people.&#160; I said that the guy was staring at me by the door&#160;&amp;

gave him a Truth packet which he took.&#160; He said "keep up the good work that you are doing here" &amp; off he went down the street.&#160; I looked for the girl with no shoes on&#160;&amp; cried afterwards for not being able to do something for her.&#160; I wish that there was one more person, on the sidewalk with me, to have helped her today.&#160; I said a prayer, to the Lord, to get help for her&#160;very soon.&#160;&#160;</font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Poor baby, please forgive me.</font></strong>&#160;</p><p align="center"><img width="96" height="145" src="/Portals/0/people_pics/212023087.jpg" alt="" style="width: 96px;
